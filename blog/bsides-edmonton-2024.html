            <p><img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/BSides-Edmonton.png" /></p>
<p>Earlier this week I had the opportunity to attend and speak at the <a href="https://www.bsidesedmonton.org/speakers">BSides
Edmonton 2024</a> event.  This is a
local event that&#8217;s been running for a few years and oddly I&#8217;ve only been
able to make it every second year, usually due to conflicts in my schedule.
This year I had reached out earlier to see when the <span class="caps">CFP</span> was opening to find
out it had already closed and I missed the opportunity to submit.  Again,
due to my schedule I opted not to&nbsp;attend.</p>
<p>A few weeks before the event, however, a speaker had dropped out and a slot
was open.  Interestingly, an old co-worker and friend (hey CRob!) was on an
OpenSSF working group call with one of the organizers and I suppose they
were lamenting the loss of a speaker when CRob told them that he knew
someone local, so they reached out to see if I could pinch-hit and all of a
sudden I was not only attenting BSides but also speaking.  Which was
awesome because I&#8217;ve never spoken about security locally.  Well,
technically not true&#8230; about a decade ago I did present to a group of home
schoolers about online security and safety (but that&#8217;s not really the same&nbsp;thing).</p>
<p>Anyhow, because of the time crunch I decided I was going to speak on the
<em>Evolution of risk-management in software</em>, the same talk I gave at <a href="https://annvix.com/blog/rh-summit-2024">Red
Hat Summit</a> earlier this year.
Easy enough.  However, when I ran through it on the Thursday before I was
speaking (last Tuesday) I realized this wasn&#8217;t the right talk for the crowd
at BSides, so I spent the weekend reworking it.  My focus was on the
content, so the talk title was only nominally adjusted, to the <em>Evolution
of risk acceptance in open source software</em>.  That name probably needs to
change but it&#8217;ll suffice for&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>The talk focused on the implicit acceptance of risk in proprietary software
(you accept the risk of what you don&#8217;t see or know about) versus the need
for an explicit acceptance of risk in open source software (accept the risk
of what you can see and know about).  We dug into some numbers of
vulnerabilities in open versus proprietary, obviously using Red Hat as the
example of an open source vendor and a well-known and unnamed proprietary
vendor as the&nbsp;contrast.</p>
<p>The room was pretty full and the audience was very engaged.  I was really
happy with the outcome of the talk and spent an hour afterwards answering
questions and talking with people about the content.  Some interesting
questions about risk management and how does one get executive management
to transfer risk decisions to those closer to the work (i.e. how to get the
people who know the technology to accept risk instead of executives looking
at things from a purely compliance perspective), what open source scanners
are best for scanning for vulnerabilities and the challenges with scanners
in general, and just general good risk acceptance and open source&nbsp;topics.</p>
<p>Of course I had someone come up asking about why Red Hat&#8217;s kernels are so
old and how they would like to see us update more often so they could
obtain the performance benefits of newer kernels to reduce their <span class="caps">AWS</span>
consumption costs.  Sigh.  I mean, I get it but there are tradeoffs between
security, stability and performance.  I think for their usecase they could
go ahead and use an upstream kernel if they wanted to.  Most Red Hat
customers prefer a stable, predictable kernel that, sure, might be a little
long in the tooth but that&#8217;s what most enterprise users who want long-life
stability&nbsp;desire.</p>
<p>Anyways, the adverserial grilling aside, it was a great talk and a good
experience.  The talk will be posted to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC73X4ic6jkiyJZ5x62xs5hw">BSides Edmonton YouTube
channel</a> but
unfortunately not until the end of October or November.  So those folks
who&#8217;ve asked to see it will have to&nbsp;wait.</p>
<p>Or, if you&#8217;re attending <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/soss-fusion/"><span class="caps">SOSS</span> Fusion
2024</a> next month you can
listen to it in-person!  I&#8217;ll be tweaking it a bit more before then so
it&#8217;ll change some, but probably not too&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>I also learned from the Tuesday morning keynote that Canada is doing some
pretty neat stuff at the federal level with respect to security.  The
<a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en">Canadian Centre for Cyber Security</a> was a
complete unknown to me before this week, and they do a lot with open source
including their Assemblyline malware analysis platform, their Howler tool
for analyzing alerts from different applications, and quite a bit more
(check out the <a href="https://github.com/CybercentreCanada">Cyber Centre Canada</a>
on GitHub.  There&#8217;s a ton of open source available&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>I had <em>no</em> idea that this was happening in my own backyard!  I think this
is pretty awesome actually and I&#8217;m really looking forward to digging into
it a bit more to see what the Cyber Centre is doing for&nbsp;Canadians.</p>
<p>I also learned that they really believe in regulatory compliance framework
reciprocity, a topic I <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/09/10/scaling-compliance-reciprocity-the-need-to-streamline-efforts-to-improve-security/">discussed recently on
Forbes</a>
so that was really exciting to hear.  They do a lot of work with <span class="caps">NIST</span>,
particularly around <span class="caps">FIPS</span> validation and testing.  It was also interesting
to see their point of view on not just creating tools in open source but
also leveraging open source and how they see that, sure, there&#8217;s some risk
but the benefits it affords, including transparency, make it easier to
manage (something I talk about often and was definitely discussed in the
talk I gave).  They also talked a bit about <span class="caps">AI</span> and Quantum Computing which
I found very interesting as well.  Very much looking forward to watching
that keynote again when it&#8217;s&nbsp;posted.</p>
<p>All in all, a great event to attend.  Hats off to the BSides volunteers and
organizers who put it on!  Thanks to the sponsors who helped make it
possible (had a few good chats with them as well), and then of course to
the other speakers who gave talks or led workshops.  I believe there were
around 500 people in attendance which is pretty&nbsp;amazing.</p>
