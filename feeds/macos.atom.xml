&lt;p&gt;I have a terrible memory, which means that I rely on a lot of tools and methodologies (like GTD, Getting Things Done) to help me track things.  This also means that I have a lot of different tools ,and I regularly re-evaluate and change them if something new can meet my ever-changing needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last two years I've been using &lt;a href="https://happenapps.com/"&gt;Quiver&lt;/a&gt; to categorize and keep notes.  These are notes for myself of people, projects, interesting things, escalations, etc.  These are also notes on nearly every meeting I attend.  For obvious reasons, these are sensitive and need to be kept under my own control.  Prior to Quiver, I was using &lt;a href="https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/"&gt;EagleFiler&lt;/a&gt; (incidentally, I still use EagleFiler, just not for note keeping -- it's a great way to organize and collect files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Quiver worked quite well, it has limitations.  As I try to do more work from my iPad rather than my laptop, the companion Quiver iOS app was showing it's limitations.  I could share the notes via my own internal WebDAV server, but it was read-only.  That is great if I only want a reference, but to fully move to my iPad for the "normal day to day" stuff I needed something where I could review and edit notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came across &lt;a href="https://inkdrop.app/"&gt;Inkdrop&lt;/a&gt; which is a note-taking application similar to Quiver with a more robust set of features, including iOS applications that will edit, and a better way of synchronizing those notes.  While Inkdrop does provide a server to store the data (which is no good for me since I want to retain full control of my data), it does allow you to use a local CouchDB server.  It also has a subscription of $5/mo which, if it can do what I need it to do, is worth it to me (particularly with the travel I've been doing of late).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things for me were standing up a CouchDB server (never played with it before) and being able to convert my Quiver library into a format that Inkdrop can use.  Fortunately, both Quiver and Inkdrop use JSON files for the metadata so with a little bit of elbow grease I figured I could make it work.  This post covers a few things: standing up the CouchDB server, getting Inkdrop to sync to it, and finally converting the data I already had in Quiver (nearly 1800 notes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CouchDB in a FreeNAS jail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to create the FreeNAS jail in which I was going to run CouchDB.  This needed to be running on my local network and not accessible to the internet.  It also needed to use HTTPS.  The first step was to create a new jail named &lt;code&gt;inkdrop&lt;/code&gt; in FreeNAS (using the web UI).  Once that was done, I logged into the FreeNAS server, entered the jail, and installed the &lt;code&gt;pkg&lt;/code&gt; tool to install what I needed for CouchDB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo iocage console inkdrop
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pkg&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pkg install couchdb2 curl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# cd /usr/local/etc/couchdb2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# vi local.ini&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we need to assign the admin user a password and note it in the &lt;em&gt;local.ini&lt;/em&gt; file.  There are other files to edit as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# vi vm.args
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;vm.args&lt;/em&gt;, change the &lt;code&gt;setcookie&lt;/code&gt; option from its default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# vi /etc/rc.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;rc.conf&lt;/em&gt; set &lt;code&gt;coudchdb2_enable&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;.  Now we can start the service and initialize our database.  The database will be named &lt;code&gt;inkdrop&lt;/code&gt; and the admin user's password is &lt;strong&gt;passwd&lt;/strong&gt; in the following examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# service couchdb2 start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X PUT http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_users&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X PUT http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_replicator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X PUT http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_global_changes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X PUT http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/inkdrop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install nginx as the CouchDB proxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to use nginx as the proxy for CouchDB so that we can have HTTPS requests rather than HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# pkg install nginx
# cd /usr/local/etc/nginx
# vi nginx.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you want to follow the &lt;a href="https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/synchronizing-in-the-cloud/#how-to-set-up-your-own-sync-server"&gt;Inkdrop instructions for setting up your own sync server&lt;/a&gt;.  That should get nginx nicely configured.  The next step is to use Let's Encrypt in the FreeNAS jail.  I've blogged about this in the past here, with &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/using-letsencrypt-on-freenas"&gt;Using LetsEncrypt on FreeNAS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/using-letsencrypt-with-plex"&gt;Using LetsEncrypt with Plex&lt;/a&gt; so I won't go into a lot of detail, but will simply note the commands used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pkg install git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# cd /root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# git clone https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh.git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# cd acme.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ./acme.sh --install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# cd /root/.acme.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# export CF_Key=&amp;quot;api_key&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# export CF_Email=&amp;quot;email_addr&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ./acme.sh --issue --dns dns_cf -d inkdrop.hostname --fullchain-file /usr/local/etc/nginx/fullchain.pem --key-file /usr/local/etc/nginx/privkey.pem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# crontab -l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/root/.acme.sh&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;acme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/root/.acme.sh&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb nb-Type"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our SSL certificate setup and making sure the cronjob is set as well, we can now start nginx and test if we can connect to our CouchDB server over HTTPS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# vi /etc/rc.conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# service nginx start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X GET https:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//127.0.0.1:6984/_all_dbs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;error&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;unauthorized&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;reason&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;You are not a server admin.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X GET https:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:6984/_all_dbs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;_global_changes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;_replicator&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;_users&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;inkdrop&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;rc.conf&lt;/em&gt; you want to set &lt;code&gt;nginx_enable&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you intend to use Inkdrop on your mobile device, you now need to create the mobile design document as per &lt;a href="https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/synchronizing-in-the-cloud/#support-mobile-sync"&gt;Inkdrop's mobile sync documentation&lt;/a&gt;, which is effectively running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X PUT https:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:6984/inkdrop -d &amp;#39;{ &amp;quot;_id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;_design/mobile&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;filters&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;sync&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;function (doc) { return doc._id.indexOf(&amp;#39;file:&amp;#39;) === -1 }&amp;quot; } }&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mobile Sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you should have a fully functional CouchDB running behind nginx in a FreeNAS jail.  Now you can point Inkdrop to your server for syncing.  You can set this up to be accessible from anywhere, or you can leave it accessible only internally.  That's the way I chose to do it since you can edit documents while disconnected and it will sync back to the server when the client is able to connect.  This allows for complete privacy by not making it available outside of your own network, but makes it portable enough that you can take your notes with you so you can add and edit as you're out and about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that would make this even better for me would be for Inkdrop to have PIN or TouchID/FaceID protection on the mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Converting from Quiver to Inkdrop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you're like me and you've used Quiver in the past, there is good news!  You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; convert from Quiver to Inkdrop.  I had to scratch my own itch here as there was no conversion tool available.  Thankfully, Quiver uses JSON files that can be parsed and, for Inkdrop, I can talk directly to the CouchDB server.  Because of this I could see the content/format of what I had in Quiver, and what Inkdrop expected in CouchDB.  It wasn't terribly difficult to figure out, just took a bit of trial and error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My script for the conversion is available on GitHub: &lt;a href="https://github.com/vdanen/quiver-to-inkdrop"&gt;quiver-to-inkdrop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a nice amusement for me, to be honest.  I always enjoy playing with new software, something I don't get to do as often as I used to (when I wrote for TechRepublic years ago I was playing with new things all the time).  Everything here aside from FreeNAS was new for me and I'd never played with CouchDB before, and I always enjoy doing a bit of Python and hacking things to make them work.  Hopefully there is something interesting or useful here for others to use as well!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="freenas"></category><category term="couchdb"></category><category term="inkdrop"></category></entry><entry><title>Figuring out GPG, SSH and U2F with YubiKey 4</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/figuring-out-gpg-ssh-and-u2f-with-yubikey-4" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-11T15:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-02-11T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2017-02-11:/blog/figuring-out-gpg-ssh-and-u2f-with-yubikey-4</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/yubikey.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know your wife is a keeper when she gets you a YubiKey 4 for your birthday!  I was really excited about this YubiKey because of its support
for storing your GPG private keys and also for an SSH private key, in addition to the U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) support …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/yubikey.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know your wife is a keeper when she gets you a YubiKey 4 for your birthday!  I was really excited about this YubiKey because of its support
for storing your GPG private keys and also for an SSH private key, in addition to the U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) support.  I've been using
earlier versions of the YubiKey for OTP (one-time password) and U2F, but the new version was especially interesting to me because of the GPG support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus it's a new toy to tinker with, and I like nerdy little things like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got it, it was easy enough to associate it with the accounts I previously had my U2F-only YubiKey associated with and also others I previously had not and probably should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when it came to getting this setup for GnuPG I ran into some interesting things.  First off, I used this &lt;a href="https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide"&gt;YubiKey
Guide&lt;/a&gt; to get things setup (this is a great guide).  I did it on my Fedora laptop because from the things I
read it seemed that using Linux for the setup would be easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That guide is pretty Debian-specific when it comes to the software install, so on Fedora you want to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo dnf install ykpers libyubikey gnupg2 gnupg2-smime pcsc-list pcsc-lite-ccid
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating the new key on the laptop was easy enough with the instructions provided but I ran into problems writing the keys to the YubiKey.  I could
program the card as root, but as the user that generated the key I was unable to write the keys.  With a bit more hunting around, I found another
blog post about using the &lt;a href="http://stafwag.github.io/blog/blog/2015/06/16/using-yubikey-neo-as-gpg-smartcard-for-ssh-authentication/"&gt;YubiKey Neo as a GPG Smartcard for SSH Authentication&lt;/a&gt; and realized I needed to give myself access to write to the card via udev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editing the &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/69-yubikey.rules&lt;/code&gt; file to add myself as an owner of the device did the trick and now it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;ACTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;add|change&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;GOTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;yubico_end&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Udev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;letting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Yubikey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;device&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;needed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;challenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;correctly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then reloading the configuration using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;udevadm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;udevadm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I could finish with the original tutorial and get the keys written to the card.  Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought.  Once this was done, the U2F logins were no longer working.  Plugging the YubiKey into my mac and trying to use it as the
second factor with some of the sites it previously worked with was no longer possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this was already a few hours of work, I went off to eat dinner and watch a show with the family.  When that was done, as often happens when
you give your mind something else to think about, it occurred to me that the command in the original tutorial about changing the mode of the YubiKey might have had something to do with it.  The original tutorial indicates that to configure the YubiKey you needed to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ykpersonalize -m82
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking out the manpage, it seems that this mode of 82 sets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MODE_FLAG_EJECT (which is the 80)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OTP/CCID composite device (which is the 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess earlier YubiKeys did not enable CCID which is what we need for GPG support.  But guess what's missing?  Right, the U2F support.  We need mode 6, which is for OTP/CCID/U2F.  So running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ykpersonalize -m86
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fixed the problem and now U2F works again (as does GPG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next problem I had was that, while GPG worked fine on my Fedora laptop, when I tried to do &lt;code&gt;gpg2 --list-secret-keys&lt;/code&gt; on my mac, it was telling me there were no secret keys.  Using &lt;code&gt;gpg2 --card-status&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;gpg2 --card-edit&lt;/code&gt; worked fine, and they even showed those card slots occupied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the heck?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out GPG 2.1 uses a different format for storing key information that GPG 1.x and 2.0 don't support or understand.  And MacGPG2 for the mac is currently providing 2.0.30 which didn't understand this stuff.  And it turns out that fink (which I use for all the extra Linux-like commands and updated CLI tools that I like) did not provide GnuPG 2.1.  As a result I switched from fink to HomeBrew because it provides GnuPG 2.1, which I found from &lt;a href="https://www.rempe.us/blog/yubikey-gnupg-2-1-and-ssh/"&gt;Yubikey, GnuPG 2.1 Modern, and SSH on macOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still some work to be done to clean a few things up.  I need to publish my new GPG key once I'm confident with it, and have signed it with
my existing key, and revoked the old key.  Then I need to put the new SSH pubkey on those servers that are critical and I want the higher security on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what I had to do to get this setup was already out there (thank you citizens of the internet!) but there were a few gotchas that others may
stumble on and since I couldn't easily find any answers (maybe I'm the only one that tripped over the ykpersonalize, or maybe most people use these for GPG/SSH and not also U2F, I have no idea).  Hopefully this will be helpful for anyone stuck in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick notes on some macOS-specific things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a MailMate user (awesome email client) but the suggestion of using a command-line pinentry program causes it to crash because it can't get input from anywhere.  You want to &lt;code&gt;brew install pinentry-mac&lt;/code&gt; first, and then use that as the pinentry program for the gpg-agent.  My &lt;code&gt;~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf&lt;/code&gt; file now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;enable-ssh-support
use-standard-socket
pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac
default-cache-ttl 600
max-cache-ttl 7200
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also want to uninstall MacGPG2 if you have it installed.  You can re-install it if you want, as it does have some nice tools, but if you do be sure to select "Customize" on the installer and de-select "GPGMail" and "MacGPG2" (basically install "GPGServices", "GPGKeychain", and "GPGPreferences" only).  I don't know if the GPGMail plugin will work with GnuPG 2.1 (I don't use Apple Mail and MailMate doesn't need it) so maybe you don't need to remove it (and I can't be bothered to find out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, I had this working fine with two macs and my Fedora laptop, but when I tried it on another mac a day or two later it did not want to work.  I finally figured out that it was because when I started fiddling with this, on the first two macs I had gnupg 2.1.17 but on the other mac it pulled the new version (2.1.18) from homebrew.  This new version does not play well with the YubiKey.  I filed &lt;a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions/issues/1522"&gt;this bug&lt;/a&gt; against homebrew but then after some more digging I found it was actually &lt;a href="https://bugs.gnupg.org/gnupg/issue2933"&gt;this upstream bug&lt;/a&gt; so hopefully 2.1.19 will fix the problem.  I note it here only because it had me scratching my head for a few days going through my setups wondering if I had done something wrong on the last mac.  Once I installed 2.1.17 on that one, everything worked peachy.  Talk about whacky timing!&lt;/p&gt;

It has some neat integration with some applications, like Sublime Text and PyCharm (both of which I use), but not for Komodo IDE (which I also use).  So this post is to show how easy it is to integrate the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash uses a URL scheme of &lt;pre&gt;dash://[query]&lt;/pre&gt; that makes it really easy to tie into any application that can callout to such URLs.  You can use URL scheme pretty much anywhere.  For instance, if you wanted to search for "os.getpid" (a Python function) you could type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ open dash://python2:os.getpid
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the commandline in the Terminal and it will open Dash, searching in the Python docset, for this function.  We will make use of that capability in our Komodo IDE toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to create a new toolbox item of the type "Command".  The only things we need to do here is give it a name (like "dash lookup"), set the command to "open dash://%W" and check off the "Do not open output pane" (since there won't be any output).  Finally, on the "Key Binding" tab, assign a new key binding; I chose CTRL-H since that mimics what Sublime Text uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/static/uploads/komodo-toolbox.jpg" alt="komodo-toolbox" width="502" height="600" class="img-responsive" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when your cursor is on a function or item in your Python code, or if you highlight something (this is represented by the "%W" in the command), hitting CTRL-H will open Dash and display search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, you're like me, you probably have a lot of docsets installed in Dash and probably don't want to search all of them when you're working on your code.  If you're working on Python, which is what I pretty much exclusively write code in, you wouldn't want search results for bash or git commands to show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash has this nice way of allowing you to restrict what docsets are searched based on what the former foreground application was (or the application that triggered the search).  So in our case, we want to restrict what we search in Dash when we launch it from Komodo.  When you click on the magnifying glass icon next to the search field in Dash, the following search profile editor pops up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/static/uploads/dash-search.jpg" alt="dash-search" width="637" height="475" class="img-responsive"  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I created a new search profile called "Komodo" and ensured that it's active only when Komodo becomes active.  And then we can add which docsets to search.  In this case, I only want to search the Flask, Jinja, and Python 2 docsets as well as the Python Format Strings cheatsheet.  This allows me to search for things that are relevant to what I use Komodo for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have as many search profiles as you like; you could define one for Sublime Text depending on what you use it for, you can define one for the Terminal (the aforementioned shell and git docsets would be a good candidate for searching from there), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, because I find this useful also, if you want to search for something in Dash from the commandline, you could create this script to do that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat ~/bin/dash

#!/bin/sh
if [ "${1}" == "" ]; then
    echo "I need an argument to launch dash with"
    exit
fi
open "dash://$@"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dash pretty much just wants a single argument for the most part so something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ dash "vagrant suspend"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;only shows you search results for "vagrant".  In this case you could type "vagrant:suspend" to have it search for the "suspend" command in the "vagrant" docset alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash is pretty neat and I'm enjoying using it as an easy reference tool.  Using it has tidied up my browser window and I feel more productive with it and I really like how easy it is to summon it from almost any program that I'm using.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="dash"></category><category term="documentation"></category><category term="komodo"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>SSL Certificate Verification failure with fink's Python 2.7.9</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/ssl-certificate-verification-failure-with-fink-s-python-2-7-9" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-06T23:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-01-06T23:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2015-01-06:/blog/ssl-certificate-verification-failure-with-fink-s-python-2-7-9</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/"&gt;Python 2.7.9 was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a month ago and with it came some SSL-related changes (it backported the Python 3.4 ssl module and does HTTPS certificate validation using the system's certificate store).

The latter can cause some problems with home-grown CA's, however.  On Mac OS X, the CA certificate store is in the Keychain Access application which isn't exposed to commandline tools like Python.  This will cause HTTPS certificate validation to fail because Python doesn't know anything about the CA certificate used to sign the certificate being used by a HTTPS server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're using the system OpenSSL, supposedly you can export the CA's of interest to the /System/Library/OpenSSL/cert.pem file (untested).  I use fink and fink's OpenSSL does not seem to use this directory.  Instead it uses /sw/etc/ssl/ and if you install fink's ca-bundle package you will have a stock /sw/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt file which presumably works with some applications.  This file can be replaced with an updated CA bundle containing the CA certificate that is used to sign the service(s) you want to connect to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, replacing that file is not enough.  If you upgrade to Python 2.7.9 in fink and make that change, you will still see this annoying error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:581)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when attempting to connect to a site using a certificate signed by a non-stock CA.  Note that prior to 2.7.9, Python did not do this CA validation so you would not see this error until upgrading to 2.7.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix is quite simple.  Put your new ca-bundle.crt file in place as noted above, and then, as root, symlink this file to /sw/etc/ssl/cert.pem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# cd /sw/etc/ssl
# ln -s certs/ca-bundle.crt cert.pem
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when using Python 2.7.9 (on a fink-using system) you will be able to connect to those sites and avoid the "certificate verify failed" error noted above.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="fink"></category><category term="openssl"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>MailMate keyboard shortcuts and Gmail archive handling</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mailmate-keyboard-shortcuts-and-gmail-archive-handling" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-28T16:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-12-28T16:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2013-12-28:/blog/mailmate-keyboard-shortcuts-and-gmail-archive-handling</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, playing around with MailMate I've found you can create keyboard shortcuts.

It comes with a standard keyboard shortcut list, one for Postbox (a Thunderbird-based email client), and Gmail.  My main need here to is to map "delete" to "Archive message" because MailMate, unlike Apple's Mail, does not seem to have a setting to turn "delete" into "archive".  So when I hit the delete key, my message goes to the trash, rather than just removing the label of the current mailbox (so if it's in the Inbox, remove the "Inbox" label, which removes it from the mailbox but keeps it in Gmail's "All Mail").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing's first, we need to create our new keybinding list.  To do this, copy the Standard.plist from &lt;b&gt;/Applications/MailMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings&lt;/b&gt; (to reveal this in the Finder, right-click the MailMate application icon and select "Show Package Contents".  This is where you'll find the three keybinding plist files: Gmail, Postbox, and Standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the directory to store the new keybinding file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/MailMate
% mkdir -p Resources/KeyBindings
% cp /Applications/MailMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings/Standard.plist Resources/KeyBindings/Mutt.plist
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a new plist file called Mutt.plist.  You can edit this file with any text editor.  I suggest copying one of the existing plist files as it will have some of the commands you may already want in there with the funky characters like the down arrow, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important one (to me) is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
"\UF728" = "deleteMessage:";
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want that backspace key to delete the message.   You can use the "archive" command here, which will remove it from the mailbox (and remove its label) but this also puts it into a new "[Gmail]/Archive" folder.  This folder doesn't exist normally.  So while it does accomplish what I want (remove it from the specified mailbox without actually permanently deleting the message), it does it in a wonky way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, this leads to more Gmail-related things.  Writing blog posts while working through issues is so much fun.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that I imported these from Apple Mail rather than creating them as new accounts.  In the &lt;a href="http://updates.mailmate-app.com/release_notes"&gt;1.7.1 release notes&lt;/a&gt; we see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New: Changed default behavior for new Gmail accounts. 1. “[Gmail]/All Mail” is subscribed. 2. Default archive mailbox is “[Gmail]/All Mail”. Existing accounts are not affected."
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting.  So when I go to edit the IMAP account, I see that these are not subscribed.  So this gets us more like Apple Mail where it also note too downloads the All Mail folder (some people have an issue with this... I never have, I kinda like that it's all downloaded).  So I had "All Mail", "Important", and "Starred" unsubscribed.  The "Important" one can remain unsubscribed as that's what Gmail thinks is important, not me.  All Mail is subscribed to, and so is Starred.  MailMate has nice smart mailboxes so you don't need to have the Starred one (it has a default smart mailboxes called "Flagged" which shows you flagged messages in each mailbox.. unfortunately, with three email accounts handled by MailMate, having three "INBOX" smart folders means I can't zero in on one specific account; the Starred mailbox will let me do that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I noticed in the 1.7.1 release notes is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; New: Changed default behavior for new Gmail accounts. 1. “[Gmail]/All Mail” is subscribed. 2. Default archive mailbox is “[Gmail]/All Mail”. Existing accounts are not affected.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing is that it seems when you subscribe to "[Gmail]/All Mail", the default archive mailbox is changed as well (so if you archive messages, it goes to All Mail rather than Archive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we can get back to your keyboard shortcuts.  As noted above, we can now change the "deleteMessage" command to "archive" and have it do what we want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
"\UF728" = "archive:";
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, because it is useful to be able to permanently delete stuff, we can have something like "^d" or some such to permanently delete:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
"^d" = "deleteMessage:";
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, calling this "Mutt" keybindings is a bit of a misnomer because they're not default mutt keybindings (although some of them are for &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; mutt setup), but here's my Mutt.plist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    "\UF728" = "archive:";               // ?  (forward-delete)
    "\U007F" = "archive:";               // delete
    "^d"     = "deleteMessage:";         // CTRL-D
    " "      = "scrollPageDown:";        // Space (alternatively it can be bound to scrollPageDownOrNextUnreadMessage:)
    "$ "     = "scrollPageUp:";          // Shift-space
    "\U000A" = "openMessages:";          // Return
    "\U000D" = "openMessages:";          // Enter

    "m"      = "newMessage:";
    "r"      = "replySender:";
    "G"      = "replyAll:";             // group reply
    "R"      = "replyList:";            // list reply
    "f"      = "forwardMessage:";
    "F"      = "toggleFlag:";           // flag-message
    "/"      = "mailboxSearch:";
    "^/"     = "searchAllMessages:";
    "~e"     = "expandThread:";         // OPT-E
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just my "starting" list.  I'll be tweaking it as I get used to MailMate more.  So far, so good...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information is found in the MailMate &lt;a href="http://manual.mailmate-app.com/custom_key_bindings"&gt;Custom key bindings&lt;/a&gt; section of the online manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT&lt;/b&gt;: I removed the bits about the custom keybindings not overriding the Standard.plist keybindings as, poking around further, I realized that you need to restart MailMate in order for it to pickup the new keybindings and that was why it did not appear to be working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="gmail"></category><category term="mailmate"></category><category term="email"></category></entry><entry><title>Mavericks Mail is Apple's worst Mail yet</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mavericks-mail-is-apples-worst-mail-yet" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-28T15:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-12-28T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2013-12-28:/blog/mavericks-mail-is-apples-worst-mail-yet</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;To begin with, I &lt;i&gt;liked&lt;/i&gt; Apple Mail in Mountain Lion (and Lion also).

Mountain Lion's Mail worked just peachy with Gmail.  This?  This ... does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anyone yacks about Gmail itself... been using Google Apps for years, love it, not changing.  Period.  I'd rather change email clients.  Which, in fact, looking at my mail this morning (after having been replying/deleting/etc mail on my phone the last two days), I see all the messages I've delete still showing as new on my computer, despite having been deleted days ago.  Seriously?  Even telling it to sync/refresh/get new mail doesn't make those deleted messages (that are most definitely &lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt; on the web UI) disappear.  The fix?  Restarting Mail.  Sorry... that doesn't cut it.  I'm not restarting my desktop mail client everytime I manipulate a mailbox on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been playing this morning with &lt;a href="http://freron.com/"&gt;MailMate&lt;/a&gt; which looks intriguing.  So far I'm liking it.  A few things I want to note so that I don't forget when setting it up on the other system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some font settings can be changed in the preferences.  The mail headers text cannot, but a quick trip to the Terminal fixes it and makes it easier for me to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% defaults write com.freron.MailMate MmHeadersViewFontName -string "Verdana"     
% defaults write com.freron.MailMate MmHeadersViewFontSize -float 14
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one changes the "on [date] so and so wrote:" string to "On 12/23/2013, at 9:59 AM, So and So wrote:" (slightly different from the default)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% defaults write com.freron.MailMate MmReplyWroteString -string 'On %m/%d/%Y, at %k:%M %p, ${from.name:${from.address}} wrote:'
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the other settings are largely set in the Preferences.  Some esoteric things are not configurable in the Preferences, so checking the Help for "Hidden Preferences" and "Low-Level Customization" will let you tweak things even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside that I've found so far is that it does not support Kerberos authentication (GSSAPI) and I can't find a way to have threads expanded by default.  The lack of GSSAPI isn't a deal-breaker (although it sure would be nice), but the thread expansion issue is pretty annoying.  The only thing I found is that holding OPTION while clicking the thread triangle or the right arrow key will expand the thread (OPTION+LEFT-ARROW to collapse the thread, but it's a bit wonky and not great as you need to be on the first message in the thread to expand/collapse the entire thread).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging into it, it looks fairly powerful.  It's a bit steeply priced for a mail client ($50USD) but since I'm in my email all the time... maybe it's worth it?  Will need to keep digging/playing during this trial period to see if it's worth the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could always wait to see if Apple fixes their sh*t, but at this point I'm so annoyed that maybe this has pushed me to find something better.  Not quite how I wanted to spend my holidays but... meh.  I don't get the opportunity to poke around with new things too often, so this is a bit of a refresher.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="gmail"></category><category term="mailmate"></category><category term="email"></category></entry><entry><title>Adventures in AppleRAID</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/adventures-in-appleraid" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-07T21:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-12-07T21:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2013-12-07:/blog/adventures-in-appleraid</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Actually, it's not much of an adventure so much as a reminder.

I'm used to doing software RAID on Linux with mdadm and am fully comfortable with the commandline tools -- in fact, I prefer them to any GUI tools that may or may not be out there (for example, if I were to have a choice of using mdadm on the commandline versus using Anaconda to setup a RAID array, I would take the commandline).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I use Apple's software RAID on OS X as well.  With mdadm I'm fully confident.  With Apple RAID I'm not as much, primarily because I've not had the opportunity to put it through it's paces, and also because Disk Utility is absolutely horrendous for dealing with setting the RAID arrays up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I was unlucky enough in mid-2012 to buy a few of those Seagate drives that chirped.  Harmless, once I realized the drives were not going to die, but annoying nonetheless.  Suffice it to say, I've gotten used to it.  Anyways, 3TB drives are $130CAD a piece now which is pretty cheap, and these drives have been running for the last year and a half pretty much non-stop.  Between price, requiring some larger drives as offline archives (to which use I can put these chirpy drives), and really feeling like I should test the Apple RAID (last test I believe was in 10.7 and now the system is running 10.9), I figured it was a good time to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple procedure: shut down the computer, pull out one drive, pop in a new drive, fire it back up.  Because I have a RAID0+1 (so three RAID arrays, two RAID mirrors and one RAID stripe), I could pull two drives, one from each mirror array, and rebuild two at a time but I prefer to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon bootup I get the "you've inserted an uninitialized disk" notice (to which I tell it to ignore the drive), get a happy degraded RAID warning from SMARTReporter, and am ready to get it back up and running.  The required commands are surprisingly simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% &lt;b&gt;sudo diskutil list&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, we've removed the first physical drive in the Mac Pro's four bays (I have an SSD as a boot device in there as disk0), so it's disk1 we're interested in.  Make a note of the disk identifier (the one with no partitions on it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we want to see what our RAID information looks like because we need to know which array this drive needs to be added to, and we need to know the unique identifer (UUID) of the RAID array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a few bits of info here.  The first is the uuid of our RAID mirror that it's in a degraded state (the RAID volume name is Stuff_2, above, with the uuid noted below the name).  The second bit of information we need is the uuid of the &lt;i&gt;failed&lt;/i&gt; drive (in this case, the drive I removed).  We will need to remove this missing device from the array after we add the new one.&lt;/p&gt;

As you can see from the above, we added the new drive (disk1) to the RAID array named Stuff_2.  And after we did so, performed another list operation, and you can see three drives associated with that array -- one is online, one is missing, and one is rebuilding.  Now we need to remove the missing one as we won't be adding it back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% &lt;b&gt;sudo diskutil appleraid remove F3921C5D-0B94-4264-9619-0291A5147F4E C96F3052-8EBD-45D5-9A25-29EE23957CA9&lt;/b&gt;
Started RAID operation
Removing disk from RAID
Finished RAID operation
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;b&gt;sudo diskutil appleraid remove [uuid-of-failed-drive] [uuid-of-raid]&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it.  Honestly, it took me longer to type this out than it did to rebuild the RAID array.  Sadly, in that time it's only progressed to 3% rebuilt.  The downside of such large drives is the reconstruction time is a little ridiculous.  Anyways, once you've run these commands in Terminal, if you were to fire up Disk Utility, you'd see a nice little GUI progress bar that, for me, indicates it will take 4hrs to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, for anyone who has fought with Disk Utility to manage anything RAID in OS X, you'll appreciate how simple the diskutil commandline tool makes things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="raid"></category></entry><entry><title>Software Update Service on OS X Lion Server</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/software-update-service-on-os-x-lion-server" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-23T17:44:00-06:00</published><updated>2012-08-23T17:44:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2012-08-23:/blog/software-update-service-on-os-x-lion-server</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Software Update Service is part of OS X Lion server (and Mountain Lion server) that allows you to download OS updates and serve them to multiple clients on a local network (similar to Red Hat's Satellite server, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux).

I've had to play with this because we're bandwidth-restricted at the church, and there are a lot of macs there, all of which need security and bugfix updates.  Attempting to download each of these updates, online, is a painful experience, so Lion Server was a logical route to take.  Except that it's annoying as all get out, and was painful to get up and running.  So this is just some notes on how I managed to get it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need (Mountain) Lion Server, and you need the Server Admin application, from where you can enable SUS (Software Update Server).  I attempted to do it transparently because I control DNS on the local network, but while this seemed to work with Lion, it doesn't seem to work with Mountain Lion... not quite sure why yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed this tutorial: &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/stupidmactricks/home/transparentsoftwareupdateserverusingmacosxlionserver107"&gt;Transparent Software Update Server using Mac OS X Lion Server 10.7&lt;/a&gt; to get me up and running.  I did notice, however, that I was not getting any updates downloaded that had been posted after May 2012, and eventually tracked it down to the IP address it recommends putting in /etc/hosts.  Do &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; use 17.250.248.95 for swscan.apple.com!  The line to add to the SUS server's /etc/hosts file is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
17.164.1.22 swscan.apple.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will get you all current updates, including Mountain Lion updates.  A few other things to note (since I need SUS to handle OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8).  The mod_rewrite section on /etc/swupd/swupd.conf should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Darwin/9
    RewriteRule ^/index\.sucatalog$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}/cgi-bin/SoftwareUpdateServerGetCatalog?/index-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Darwin/10

&lt;p&gt;(Sorry, the above looks a bit messed up, but you should be able to copy-n-paste it).  And my /etc/swupd/swupd.plist looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

    &amp;lt;integer&gt;0&amp;lt;/integer&gt;
&amp;lt;/dict&gt;
&amp;lt;/plist&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With those changes, I can serve the updates to my mac clients, but not on Mountain Lion.  On Mountain Lion clients you need to run this command to explicitly point to the SUS server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL http://[SUS_SERVER]:8088/index.sucatalog
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when you launch the App Store and check for updates, it will find any new Mountain Lion updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For transparent updates on earlier versions of OS X, I added the following to my DNS server's named.conf:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
zone "swscan.apple.com" {
    type master;
    file "master/swscan.apple.com.zone";
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the swscan.apple.com.zone file contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$TTL    86400
@       IN SOA  swscan.apple.com. root.mydomain.com. (
                    2012060201      ; serial (d. adams)
                    12H     ; refresh
                    15M     ; retry
                    1W      ; expiry
                    1D )        ; minimum
            IN NS       dns.mydomain.com.
        IN MX       10 smtp.mydomain.com.

localhost   IN A        127.0.0.1
swscan.apple.com. IN A      192.168.0.10
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect there is another domain name that needs to be resolved somewhere in addition to swscan.apple.com, but I've not had the time to track it down as of yet.  An easy way to check is on Lion and earlier if you run "sudo softwareupdate -l" and watch the logs on your SUS, you'll see the connections from that client.  The same does not happen with Mountain Lion clients unless you do the "defaults write" command noted earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone knows how to make Mountain Lion clients connect to the SUS transparently, I would love to hear about how you got it to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="swupd"></category></entry><entry><title>USB3 benchmarks on Mac Pro</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/usb3-benchmarks-on-mac-pro" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-10T20:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-03-10T20:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2012-03-10:/blog/usb3-benchmarks-on-mac-pro</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased the HighPoint RocketU 1144AM PCI-E 2.0 x4 Quad-Port USB 3.0 Raid card for my Mac Pro.

Since most external drives you buy these days are USB3, and the Mac Pro only has (and perhaps only every will have, if the rumour mill is true) USB2 ports, the only option I had for expansion was a USB3 card.  The Mac Pro doesn't have Thunderbolt on it, and the external drives equipped with Thunderbolt are prohibitively expensive right now, so USB3 looked to be a better bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card cost me under $150CAD, including shipping from the US.  This card is pretty sweet; it has four ports on it so you can have four external drives, but beyond that you can also set them up as RAID0, RAID1, RAID5, or RAID10, and JBOD.  There also seems to be a way you can bond the four ports together if the cables all go to the same storage device (I don't know of any such devices at the moment though, and I imagine they're probably right up there in cost with a Thunderbolt storage device).  Individually, the ports are 5Gb/s, bonded you can supposedly get 20GB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did a few tests, and this card has seriously impressed me.  I copied a 2GB file around in random ways to measure the speeds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; From internal SATA2 drive to USB2 drive: 1:02.98s
&lt;li&gt; From internal SATA2 drive to the same drive: 20.952s
&lt;li&gt; From internal SATA2 drive to another internal SATA2 drive: 25.050s
&lt;li&gt; From internal SATA2 drive to USB3 drive: 19.652s
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about wow.  Note it was the exact same drive, first connected to a USB2 port and then connected to a USB3 port.  The speed increase on USB2 to USB3 is insane.  What's even more astonishing to me is that the transfer speeds were faster to the USB3 drive than to another internal drive.  I suppose if the guts of this thing had SATA3 it would be a different story though.  Since I don't think I'll be getting SATA3 in this thing anytime soon (and since I have run out of space for expansion cards due to the second double-high video card I've got in here), I suppose I'll have to live with it.  All in all, I think this was a good investment to make.  If I run out of room internally, I don't have to worry about just using external drives for "sometimes" access, but I imagine it would work well enough to run a virtual machine off of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="usb3"></category></entry><entry><title>SSD Speed-ups on Mac Pro</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/ssd-speed-ups-on-mac-pro" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-02-26T14:19:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-02-26T14:19:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2012-02-26:/blog/ssd-speed-ups-on-mac-pro</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have an SSD in my Fedora workstation for my &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/rq/"&gt;rq&lt;/a&gt; tool, specifically for the MySQL database.

The speed increase there, because it was dealing with huge amounts of data, was very welcome -- not so much for importing (speed there didn't much increase since all the files being operated on were on the HDD), but for querying it is wicked fast.  Besides that, and the built-in SSD of my MacBook Air, I've not used SSD before as it is just too expensive.  I'm a data storage junkie, so I opted more for large storage than fast access (and the price per GB of SSDs is a little too rich for me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I picked up the first SSD that I've bought (the other SSD in my Fedora box is a loaner from a friend).  It's a 240GB OCZ Agility 3, and it's still over $1/GB which is a bit nuts, but since I have an extra SATA connection in my Mac Pro, I figured I'd give it a go.  This rig is pretty good: 2 quad core Xeon CPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 8TB HDD space including the one external USB drive.  The only real bottle-neck on this thing is disk I/O, so I figured I would give the whole SSD thing a go, since I knew I'd get better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an impromptu timer on my phone, from chime to login screen, it took 3:07.7 minutes, and from when I hit enter at the login screen until all the apps were open and ready for use it took another 3:54.9 minutes (some of this is network-bound, as I waited for Chrome to reload its two windows with 27 tabs, and there are other hefty apps like iTunes (with a massive library), EagleFiler, Daylite, Mail, and quite a few others).  So from turning the machine on to when I could use it was roughly 7 minutes.  After installing the SSD and cloning my boot drive to it (and doing a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of file moving so it would all fit!), then rebooting it once so any caches would be updated, I rebooted again and timed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From chime to login screen took 35.3 seconds.  From login to all items ready for us took 43.0 seconds.  So my boot time went from 7 minutes, to under 1.5 minutes all told.  I think this is the best $300 I ever dropped.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="ssd"></category></entry><entry><title>Unwanted guest account in OS X 10.7.2</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/unwanted-guest-account-in-os-x-10-7-2" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-13T11:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-10-13T11:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2011-10-13:/blog/unwanted-guest-account-in-os-x-10-7-2</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was thoroughly annoyed to find a guest account with a sandboxed Safari after I had setup iCloud on OS X 10.7.2.

Turns out, this only appears when you have "Find My Mac" enabled, and it does make sense (how can your mac be found if no one is using it?).  If you don't like the idea of a guest account on your mac (even if you've disabled the guest account in System Preferences) make sure that Find My Mac is turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, if you have FileVault enabled for full-disk encryption, the guest account login still shows up when the system starts.  This leads me to believe that some of the system preferences and a copy of Safari are stored in the Lion recovery partition.  Annoyingly enough, this includes keys for wireless access points.  I don't know if there is a way to get that information (I suspect not, but you never know), but this means that some things are being stored outside of the FileVault, which concerns me somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Kerberos on OS X 10.7 (Lion)</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/kerberos-on-os-x-10-7-lion" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-26T12:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-07-26T12:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2011-07-26:/blog/kerberos-on-os-x-10-7-lion</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I had upgraded my wife's MacBook to Lion and discovered that, once again, Apple screwed around with Kerberos.

This seems to be a recurring theme (and not a good one).  After quite a bit of fighting and figuring, a few things have been sorted out.  Once I've got it completely figured out, I'll document it on my wiki but in the meantime (since there is a severe shortage of good info about Kerberos in Lion), here's the skinny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; MIT Kerberos has been replaced with Heimdal
&lt;li&gt; Heimdal seems to prefer UDP over TCP; so if your KDC has a firewall in place to block UDP ports 88 and 749, you probably want to change your firewall rules to allow access to UDP (or you get strange errors: kinit says it can't reach any defined KDC, Ticket Viewer says you provided the wrong password)
&lt;li&gt; /Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos is still a valid configuration file, however you need to remove the quotes (e.g if you have &lt;code&gt;default_realm = "FOO.CA"&lt;/code&gt; you need to change that to &lt;code&gt;default_realm = FOO.CA&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;li&gt; Subversion (either Lion-supplied or via Fink) does not seem to do GSSAPI negotiation anymore
&lt;li&gt; Google Chrome on Lion does not seem to do GSSAPI negotiation anymore
&lt;li&gt; Safari on Lion &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; work with Kerberized (mod_auth_kerb) websites
&lt;li&gt; Supposedly you do not need to change /etc/authorization anymore; Lion is using a PAM stack that should give you a ticket upon login (provided your kerberos password and login password are the same (or presumably it is store in your Keychain) -- I've not tested this yet
&lt;li&gt; Someone indicated that you can prefix the KDC hostname in /Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos with "tcp/host" to make Heimdal talk over TCP (preventing the need to open UDP ports), but there is also another indication that this doesn't work -- I've not tested this yet either
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the point is it's messy.  There is an ongoing discussion on the Apple support forums here: &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3189202"&gt;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3189202&lt;/a&gt; so if you're experiencing some oddness (or getting things to work!) please either note in the comments here or on that discussion thread.  I would &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; like to get subversion and Chrome working with kerberos auth again -- those are the only two things preventing me from going forward with Lion on other systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="kerberos"></category></entry><entry><title>Google Apps' two-factor authentication provides security boost for Mac and iPhone users</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/google-apps-two-factor-authentication-provides-security-boost-for-mac-and-iphone-users" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-05-25T14:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-05-25T14:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2011-05-25:/blog/google-apps-two-factor-authentication-provides-security-boost-for-mac-and-iphone-users</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's mac tip was &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/mac/google-apps-two-factor-authentication-provides-security-boost-for-mac-and-iphone-users/1159"&gt;Google Apps' two-factor authentication provides security boost for Mac and iPhone users&lt;/a&gt; which looks at how to setup two-factor authentication on the mac (or anywhere else really, this isn't quite specific to the mac).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-factor authentication turns off a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of people because they think it's too hard but it honestly isn't, and the security benefits it provides are outstanding.  Two-factor authentication operates on two principles or components for an authentication "token" (or password for lack of a better term): one thing you know (your password) and one thing you don't (a random time-based PIN that a hardware device generates for you).  This means that if someone has my username and password, that information is utterly &lt;i&gt;useless&lt;/i&gt; without having my hardware token (which can be, in the case of Google, an iPhone or Android phone, etc.).  Which makes my account really quite secure, and certainly more secure than it would be with just a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sincerely care about your Google Apps security, you really owe it to yourself to check out the two-factor authentication support.  It's easy to setup, cheap to setup, and easy to use as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Two SSH clients to consider for the iPad</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/two-ssh-clients-to-consider-for-the-ipad" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-05-25T14:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-05-25T14:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2011-05-25:/blog/two-ssh-clients-to-consider-for-the-ipad</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's mac tip is &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/mac/two-ssh-clients-to-consider-for-the-ipad/1170"&gt;Two SSH clients to consider for the iPad&lt;/a&gt;.

CrashPlan is pretty neat: you can pay to store your backups on CrashPlan's servers in the cloud, or you can use the client for free to backup to other computers that you own or belong to friends.  I've got a few computers here, and my mom has one with more space than she knows what to do with, so setting up CrashPlan on three computers here and one remotely, I can use CrashPlan for free, which is great.  Another bonus is CrashPlan is cross-platform, so I can run it on the two macs here, the mac at my mom's, and the Fedora 14 workstation I'm running here as well.  Works amazingly well, even considering that the mac in the kitchen and the one at my mom's place aren't constantly running like the other two are.  If you're looking for an easy way to do off-site backups, CrashPlan can do the job without costing you a cent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="backup"></category></entry><entry><title>Easily distracted?

Mac tools that keep you focused&lt;/a&gt;.  This was an interesting tip to write because when you sit in front of the computer all day, it's sometimes hard to quantify how much productive work you get done.  Like now, updating my blog, for instance.  =)  If you're in front of the computer for 14hrs a day, how many of those are productive hours?  How many are wasted time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tool that I looked at was called Concentrate, which sets you up with a fully customizable "work session".  When I first saw Concentrate I thought it was kind of gimicky, but I've come to appreciate how it lets me, easily, shove stuff out of the way and only pull up the things I need.  Having a timer handy ensures that I can work for a set amount of time and gives me a sense of actually concentrating and getting things done.  The other is a web service called Rescue Time and it's quite interesting to see the stats on yourself.  My boss will be happy to know that this week I am in the top 16% of Rescue Time people, with an efficiency summary score of 1.12 vs the average of 0.4.  That actually seems to be pretty consistent, which is somewhat scary (for the average person).  It also shows me that the bulk of my time is spent in the Terminal each week (the highest used application).  There is proof that I'm a CLI junkie.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="gtd"></category></entry><entry><title>How to reassign the primary display on multi-display Macs</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/how-to-reassign-the-primary-display-on-multi-display-macs" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-17T19:24:00-07:00</published><updated>2011-02-17T19:24:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2011-02-17:/blog/how-to-reassign-the-primary-display-on-multi-display-macs</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's mac techmail is &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/mac/how-to-reassign-the-primary-display-on-multi-display-macs/1015"&gt;How to reassign the primary display on multi-display Macs&lt;/a&gt; which is pretty simplistic, but really sweet all at the same time.

I know there are other alternatives, like the multi-platform PS3 Media Server, but that one at least I found to be fairly convoluted and took too much time to get it working properly (mind you, it was a while ago so perhaps things have changed since then).  PS3 Media Server also only unofficially supports the XBOX 360, whereas Playback supports PS3 and XBOX 360, out of the box, easily.  Playback had me up and streaming in minutes with minimal configuration, which is exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>How to set up an OS X OpenVPN client</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/how-to-set-up-an-os-x-openvpn-client" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-26T12:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-10-26T12:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2010-10-26:/blog/how-to-set-up-an-os-x-openvpn-client</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's mac techmail was &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/mac/?p=783"&gt;How to set up an OS X OpenVPN client&lt;/a&gt; which looks at using the fantastic Shimo VPN client program to setup a client endpoint to an OpenVPN-based VPN (using certificates).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/mac/?p=658"&gt;Choose which folders you want to encrypt with Espionage&lt;/a&gt; talks about Espionage, a really awesome tool for encrypting specific directories and application data.  I love this tool; with it I can have the important data on my laptop encrypted with AES-256 encryption (military-grade) such as email so that if the laptop is every stolen, and if they manage to get to the contents of the hard drive (trivial if they have physical access) they still can't get to the important encrypted data.  As an aside, there is a &lt;a href="http://www.mupromo.com/"&gt;MacUpdate promo bundle&lt;/a&gt; right now that includes Espionage.&lt;/p&gt;

While I like the security model (sandboxing, etc.) in Chrome, I really can't stand it and I hate how it phones home all the time (thanks, Little Snitch) even when you tell it not to.  Still Safari and Firefox for me, but worth keeping an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

A little slow, but still faster than I would have expected considering this is all coming through the browser.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>Advanced tips for using LaunchBar shortcuts with Mac</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/advanced-tips-for-using-launchbar-shortcuts-with-mac" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-07T11:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-05-07T11:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2010-05-07:/blog/advanced-tips-for-using-launchbar-shortcuts-with-mac</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's mac techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/mac/?p=476"&gt;Advanced tips for using LaunchBar shortcuts with Mac&lt;/a&gt;.

It's something you'd only really need to use once, but it works really well.  And with the ability to upload mbox and maildir format mails as well (instead of just old Apple Mail, Thunderbird, Entourage, etc. email), you can use a tool like offlineimap to suck down old mails to a maildir, then turn around and upload them back to Google Apps.

It's essentially a polished front-end for FUSE with sshfs support for the SFTP/SSH connections.  It's a really great tool and while not free, it's relatively inexpensive and works wonders.  With it I can remotely mount the filesystem of my VPS using SSH with keys, or connect to the home filesystem while on the road, etc.  And instead of having to navigate the remote filesystem within one application like a traditional FTP client, I can access it using the terminal, Finder, PathFinder, or any other utility that operates on the local filesystem.  It securely mounts the remote filesystems to be as available as a SMB or AFP share.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>1Password for Mac OS X: One program to store them all</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/1password-for-mac-os-x-one-program-to-store-them-all" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-20T08:25:00-07:00</published><updated>2010-02-20T08:25:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2010-02-20:/blog/1password-for-mac-os-x-one-program-to-store-them-all</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's mac techmail was &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/mac/?p=346"&gt;1Password for Mac OS X: One program to store them all&lt;/a&gt; which is an introduction to the immensely useful 1Password program.

If you have a mac and you don't have 1Password, you're doing yourself a huge disservice.  1Password stores passwords (browsers, database, SSH logins, etc.), serial numbers, and notes in an encrypted keychain format.  It has plugins for the mac browsers that let's you autofill password information in sites meaning you have one place to store your passwords and they are accessible from all browsers (and you can add new login info from any browser).  To make it even better, you can sync the 1Password keychain using Dropbox or whatever so the same keychain can be used on different systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the absolute best password management app I've ever laid eyes on.  The companion iPhone/iPod Touch app is icing on the cake.

&lt;p&gt;Daylite is one of my most-used programs that I've been using for years on the mac.  I absolutely love it.  It gets me my contacts and calendar, and other assorted goodies, on my desktop, my laptop, and my iPhone.  Multi-user, networked, allowing for offline databases that sync back to the online database... it's expensive, but it's pure goodness.  Sure, it's had it's fair share of issues and I've had one catastrophe with it a few years ago, but I love it and use it daily.

This week Apple wrecked it by making Kerberos an absolute nuisance.  It wasn't bad in OS X 10.5.. a bit annoying to setup but the tools were adequate.  In 10.6 they threw away the half-decent GUI and gave us a crap dummied-up GUI which means whenever I need to kinit, I have to open a Terminal.  More importantly, whenever my &lt;em&gt;wife&lt;/em&gt; has to kinit, &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; has to open a Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a big thing for me as Terminal is always open... but for her?  She's never opened it once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple... what were you thinking?  Kerberos is an absolute PITA now and not nearly as convenient as it could/should be.  Certainly nothing like Kerberos support on my Fedora workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's plenty to like about Snow Leopard, but when I went through the effort of getting Kerberos working last month, using it on the mac was a joy.  Now?  Well... all those companies and schools that use kerberos are really going to be thinking twice about upgrading until this gets worked out or someone writes a good app to handle it.  I mean, really... how hard is it to have something in the menu bar that you can click on to renew your ticket or get one in the first place?  Not so hard (well, for me it would be, but not for someone who knows how to write these little apps).  I'm also &lt;a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20090826171748770"&gt;not the only person to feel this way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So looking for (and this is for the sake of search engines and other searchers!) a One Time Password (OTP) S/Key solution for OS X, I came across &lt;a href="http://blee.org/Ski/"&gt;Ski&lt;/a&gt; which has been updated recently and does pretty much the same thing SKeyCalc does.  And it doesn't crash.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>OS X on an MSI Wind</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/os-x-on-an-msi-wind" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-12-27T09:39:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-12-27T09:39:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-12-27:/blog/os-x-on-an-msi-wind</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For kicks, this Christmas I decided to give myself something "hackish" to do, and noticed that the local Staples was selling the MSI Wind with SUSE on it for $299CAD.

This little beast (the U90, model number MS-N811) is nice... a little bit bigger than my Eeepc, so the keys are bigger which is nice.  Comes with a 120GB HDD, only 512MB RAM ($40CAD later I'm at 1.5GB RAM).  I decided to give installing OS X a go on it (tried on the Eeepc last year when I got it and more or less failed miserably).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of the MSI Wind was prompted by some discussion on the Mac Ministry mailing list, and it seems like one of the best netbooks to use to install OS X on.  And for the price point, it seemed like a reasonable thing to try.  If all else failed, I could restore SUSE or stick Mandriva on it and give it to my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/12/gadget-lab-vide.html"&gt;this blog entry on Wired&lt;/a&gt; that gave me a good starting point.  I won't post the links to the MSIwindosx.iso (which is hacked copy of Leopard updated to 10.5.4).  The blog entry does pretty good on covering that and the initial basics, and where to download the OSX86Tools program you'll need.  This is more of a supplement to that, which is where I got most of what I needed.  I did do things a wee bit differently, and the end result is that now I have the latest 10.5.6 running on my Wind, with my various applications working.  The only things that don't work, as of this point (and I only did this on the 23rd), is the wired ethernet (which, by all accounts, &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; work).  I haven't tried the built-in mic, the headphones, or bluetooth.  Wireless works tho, so I'm good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wired thing got me going, so I'm going to reiterate some of it here.  What you need is the MSIwindosx.iso, which you'll get from the Pirate Bay's torrents, and OSX86Tools.  Links to both are from the Wired blog.  You'll also want a 4GB USB key (much easier to work with than a DVD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you want to do is put your USB key into an existing mac and launch Disk Utility.  Partition it to make a single MBR partition, and format it as "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)".  When it's done, select the USB parition, click on the Restore tab, and drag MSIWindosx.iso to the Source field and select the USB partition as the Destination.  Click the Restore button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that is done, unzip and launch OSX86Tools.  Click the "Install EFI/Run FDISK" button, then select "Run Script".  A Terminal window will pop up; type in your administrator password.  Type "4" to run Chameleon EFI, select the drive number, and then the partition to install.  It will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, eject the USB drive, put it into the MSI Wind, turn it on and hold down F11 and select the USB device to boot from.  Now this is where I differed slightly from the Wired article... before doing anything, launch Disk Utility (from the menu bar at the top), select the HDD in the MSI Wind, and repartition the drive.  Make sure you use the GUID partition scheme, not MBR which should be what it is currently using.  Once you've done that and formatted the partition, exit Disk Utility and you'll be back at the installer.  Continue on to the Installation Summary screen, click the "Customize" button, select "Patches", and uncheck "Kernel".  Leave everything else.  Continue the install and when it's done, reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you'll have a hacked 10.5.4 install on your MSI Wind and it should boot without problems.  You'll want to transfer the Realtek wireless LAN driver using the USB key from your mac to the Wind.  I downloaded &lt;a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/osxdrivers/Realtek_RTL8187SE_MacOS10.5_Driver_073_UI_1.6.2.zip"&gt;Realtek_RTL8187SE_MacOS10.5_Driver_073_UI_1.6.2.zip&lt;/a&gt; and transferred it via the USB key and installed it.  You'll have to reboot again to get it active.  Now, this driver is a little strange... you can't use it like a regular airport card; it creates a "bridge" type connection so OS X thinks it's a wired connection, and the tool that comes with it manages the wireless settings.  It's definitely non-mac, the UI is a little bad, but it works which is the important part.  You can opt to get a new wireless card and install it, but this works well enough for me.  Make sure you press "Fn-F11" to turn the wireless on or you may end up looking at the tool for a few minutes wondering why the heck it isn't working.  Anyways, now you can connect to your wireless network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the 10.5.6 combo update.  I chose the combo update rather than the incremental update largely because that's all I ever use.  It's a bigger download, but since I keep these things around, I just threw it on a USB key and installed from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you reboot into 10.5.6, you'll find a whole bunch of stuff doesn't work.  The keyboard and trackpad don't work, the screen resolution is off, etc.  Make sure you have a USB mouse and keyboard plugged in!  So what you need to do is pop in the USB key that still contains the MSIWindosx.iso contents and look for the /Volumes/USB/System/Installer/Patches/ directory (it may be a different root depending on what you've named the key).  Anyways, copy the Patches/ directory to somewhere convenient; I copied it to ~/Desktop/Patches/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go into the directory and remove the update and kernel pkg files.  Delete them.  You don't want them at all.  What you do want to do is reinstall all of the other pkg files.  You could do them one at a time, which is a pain, or fire up Terminal and do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cd ~/Desktop/Patches/
$ for i in *.pkg; do sudo installer -pkg $i -target "/"; done
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, and it'll take a few minutes, reboot and voila!  You'll have a fully functional 10.5.6 install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have more monkeying around to do, but so far the wired Ethernet is still not working.  Sound works, the wireless works with the third-party driver, and everything else seems to work.  I haven't tried Bluetooth yet, or the headphones or mic.  The webcam is pretty crappy... not nearly as nice as the iSight built into my macbook.  The trackpad is also extremely irritating.  It's very jumpy and erratic.  I ended up hopping into System Preferences to put the Tracking Speed down to as slow as it would go (under Keyboard &amp;amp; Mouse, then the Mouse tab).  This makes it moderately manageable.  I do need to find a way to disable the tap-is-a-click feature (I hate that at the best of times), and it doesn't do gestures or two-finger scrolling, etc.  It works moderately ok, but takes some getting used to.  I also haven't tried hooking it up to an external monitor yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, this baby works quite well.  You have to get used to the small screen size, but that's part of the experience and if you can't work with small text and small resolutions, don't even bother.  But, to me, the fact that I can get OS X running on a small machine that cost me, all told, $350CAD... well, that’s pretty sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has figured out how to fix the trackpad, please leave a comment and let me know!  There might be a kernel extension out there or preference setting somehow that could be used to configure it, but so far I haven't found it.  Another good resource, if you have the patience to poke around in it, is the &lt;a href="http://forums.msiwind.net/mac/"&gt;MSI Wind Forums&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm sure some solutions for my issues may exist there, but there are so many posts that refer to methods (but without linking to them), it's moderately painful to wade through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people on MacMin have asked how I got this going, so here you go!  Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>A week with OS X server</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/a-week-with-os-x-server" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-11T17:47:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-07-11T17:47:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-07-11:/blog/a-week-with-os-x-server</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote about my &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/blog/2007/11/09/20-minutes-with-os-x-leopard-server/"&gt;20 minutes with OS X Leopard server&lt;/a&gt;.

This week I had the opportunity, and the obligation, to spend a bit more time with it.  Next month I'm converting an office that's currently using Windows and Exchange for an OS X-based solution.  There will be a few desktops, a laptop, and an xserve.  Not really a big deal for what he wants as OS X server will take care of pretty much everything and I knew that it wouldn't take me too long to catch onto it, but I wanted to take the time to figure out any quirks before I actually obtained the hardware and started billing for my time.  Since the server software purchase will get absorbed in the cost of the work, and would probably save a lot of time down the road, I picked up a copy late last week and have been slowly working this week to get my old dual G5 up and running to (temporarily, at least) replace my Mandriva-based LAN server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read some blog posts in the last week or so saying how Apple deviates too much from UNIX, how OS X server isn't as good for web serving as Linux, etc.  Unfortunately, those posts look worse for the blogger than for the software.  OS X server is no worse for web hosting (or "service" hosting) as anything else.  The problem is these people probably spent a few hours or maybe a day or two at most trying to figure stuff out.  And they took all their Linux "baggage" with them.  Well, they're right in one thing... it is different.  Very different.  Is it worse?  Not really... it does the same job.  The tools are different, file locations are different, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server I setup has the following duties:  DHCP, DNS, intranet wiki, nagios monitor, SMTP relay (for the LAN going out), POP3/IMAP (LAN-only), file sharing (samba and since we're using OS X here AFP as well), LDAP for authentication, and subversion server.  The client's xserve will do most of this, except for nagios.  It will also require handling a VPN, so I will be setting up mine to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few things that are different.  Server Admin is a very cool GUI tool to configure the server.  For the most part, it works really really well.  It was somewhat painful setting up DHCP and DNS since I couldn't import my old named zone files and such (at least not that I could find).  But after an hour of mind-numbing and boring typing, it worked well enough.  Setting up Apache was easy enough and Server Admin works for some basic stuff, although if you really want to do more complex things, you'll want to fiddle around in &lt;i&gt;/etc/apache2/&lt;/i&gt; to make changes.  One word of warning:  some stuff you can change and still use Server Admin and it won't get mangled.  Some stuff you can't so I suggest getting the basics done in Server Admin and then &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; using it to manage sites (even viewing the site seems to be enough to trigger an update of the config file).  In particular, setting "DAV svn" to enable the http subversion access resulted in (repeated) changes to "DAV off".  Apparently Server Admin doesn't thing "svn" is a valid option here.  Also, rewrite rules kept getting rewritten... with a whole lot of nothing.  I use rewrite rules extensively for my mediawiki install so it ticked me off a few times when all of a sudden they stopped working.  Beyond that, Server Admin works well enough for Apache (again, more basic stuff).  I suppose I could be using .htaccess files for this stuff and then I wouldn't have to worry about Server Admin removing stuff on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up subversion was pretty easy, less the rewriting noted above.  &lt;a href="http://blog.paploo.net/2007/10/how-to-manage-your-own-subversion.html"&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; was moderately helpful for anyone else interested in setting up a subversion server on OS X.  Leopard is using 1.4.4, but I think I'll be upgrading that soon, which may prove interesting to see if/how it will use the new modules instead of the old ones without actually removing the old subversion setup, since it comes with OS X.  Setting up ViewVC for a web view of the subversion repository was pretty straightforward as well.  No real surprises there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagios was more interesting.  Actually, it wasn't too bad... just time consuming.  The Mandriva nagios configs are.. fugly.. to put it bluntly.  Too many files, too many different places to look, so I spent quite a bit of time smushing all the useful stuff into a half-dozen configs which makes it much easier to manage.  I built the latest nagios and nagios plugins from source.  Before that, make sure you have something like fink or macports (I use fink) installed, as well as the Xcode developer tools.  Beyond that, it was pretty straightforward as well.  The only problem I ran into was the check_ldap(s) plugins didn't want to work... not sure if this is due to a newer version or if it's due to Open Directory.  I've disabled that plugin for now (although, strangely enough, the check_ircd plugin works now when it wasn't working on Mandriva... go figure).  Oh, if you like to use the check_fping plugin, use fink to install fping but make sure you make /sw/sbin/fping suid root, otherwise the plugin running under nagios (which here runs as nagios:nagios) won't be able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL was easy.  Set the root password in Server Admin and imported a dump of my database.  No issues there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mail was different, and I used Server Admin exclusively for that.  Seems to have enough options and through it can handle spam filtering via spamassassin and virus scanning via clamav.  I'm used to exim myself, and OS X uses postfix, so I think I'll let Server Admin handle that part.  What I've done with it so far works well enough, and POP3 works.  I'm thinking of seeing if I can get procmail and fetchmail running on there to grab my mail, filter it all into individual IMAP mailboxes, and just use IMAP to connect to my local server to get all my mail.  Not sure if that will work very well (due to personal and work accounts being smushed into one IMAP setup), but I think that would largely be a client-side issue anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weirdest thing for me, and the one big drawback to OS X that I found, was the handling of IP aliases.  I don't want to write silly route commands, I want aliases to be setup once and persist across reboots, etc.  Took me a bit, but it's clumsy compared to Linux.  With Mandriva, I just create new /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:0 files and go to town.  With OS X, you have to edit /etc/IPAliases.conf and stuff like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
en0:10.10.2.1
en0:10.10.2.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you have to reboot to enable it.  Also don't forget to edit /etc/hostconfig and set "IPALIASES=-YES-" (I didn't realize I needed to do this and couldn't figure out for a few minutes why my aliases weren't coming up after a reboot).  "man IPAliases.conf" is a good place to look as well.  Finally, note that OS X will get, and use, the DNS name of the &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; defined IP alias.  I have no idea why, since my computer's name is "fenris", why the shell prompt and "hostname" were giving me the name "dns", which happens to be the DNS name of the last IP defined in /etc/IPAliases.conf.  However, if the name reported by hostname is important, use one of the aliases in the Network settings of System Preferences and put the IP address that belongs to the DNS name (A record, please) as the last IP alias.  There's also no "eth0:0" or "eth0:1" so you can't just shut off one alias and add another on-the-fly like you can in Linux.  all IPs are assigned to the associated ethernet device, so in my case if I were to do "/sbin/ifconfig en0" you'd see all five associated IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was probably the weirdest thing to deal with, besides file location differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and system-wide cron stuff.  Normally I drop a script or symlink to a script in /etc/cron.daily/, but OS X uses periodic instead.  It's not very different, so just create the script/symlink in /etc/periodic/daily/ instead and it will be run with the daily system jobs (i.e. I created /etc/periodic/daily/900.svn-verify to execute the daily script I run to verify the integrity of my subversion repositories).  The only real difference here against cron on a Linux system is that unless you redirect output to /dev/null, the output of cron scripts gets emailed to you (well, if you provide an email address).  Not so with periodic, at least not by default.  I assume there must be a way to do it, but my daily output, instead of coming to my inbox, went into /var/log/daily.out instead.  I don't like that since I want to have delivered to me notification that my svn repos need repair; I don't want to have to remember to look at the file.  I need to look into this further... I suspect it shouldn't be too difficult, but I'm not familiar with periodic at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, LDAP authentication.  On my network, I use LDAP authentication on all the Linux workstations and vmware images just because it makes it easier on me.  I've not had much luck getting OS X workstations to authenticate against my Linux-based LDAP directory, so with Open Directory on OS X server, it's quite easy to make it work with OS X workstations.  I also found out it was quite easy to do with Linux as well and didn't really take much to change it (since Open Directory is based on OpenLDAP).  A few minor tweaks to my /etc/ldap.conf file and I was up and running.  The only thing I had to remember was that OD exports the home information as being /Users/foo, instead of /home/foo.  This is easy enough to remedy, by either making /Users a symlink to /home, or moving /home to /Users.  For anyone interested, my /etc/ldap.conf for Mandriva looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ldap.conf for authentication against OpenDirectory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;host fenris.annvix.ca
base dc=fenris,dc=annvix,dc=ca
ldap version 3
scope one
pam_filter objectclass=posixAccount
pam_login_attribute uid
pam_password crypt
nss_base_passwd cn=users,dc=fenris,dc=annvix,dc=ca?one
nss_base_shadow cn=users,dc=fenris,dc=annvix,dc=ca?one
nss_base_group cn=groups,dc=fenris,dc=annvix,dc=ca?one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ssl start_tls&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ssl off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;OpenDirectory home directories are /Users/foo, so create&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;a /Users directory and symlink appropriate /home directories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;there (or rename /home to /Users)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;everything else is configured the same as if using a LDAP auth source&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I have to figure out the SSL/TLS stuff in Open Directory yet.  There's also some kerberos stuff in there I'm thinking of playing with to make everything single-signon.  But that will come later.  For my home network, this is sufficient, and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing left to do now is the VPN stuff, but I'll do that this weekend when I can go to my dad's and borrow his internet connection to see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, as of right now my Mandriva LAN server is temporarily off and I'm going to be using the OS X server for the next week or two, to make sure there are no surprises.  That way, next month when I have to do mostly the same thing for a client, there won't be (too many) surprises.  So is OS X server worse than Linux?  Not really.  They're both pretty much the same.  Those who like GUI configs will like OS X server... the Server Admin and Workgroup Manager tools are really quite nice.  For someone like me who developed Annvix without a GUI, I don't much care, and the (compared to Linux) non-standard location for files was frustrating and trying.  There's obviously a lot to fiddle with yet, but the basic services are up and running which is what I need.  When this thing has a few services turned off so my Mandriva server can once again resume it's duties, it'll be left around for a debugging/reference platform as it's always nicer to muck up your own stuff instead of a client's.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>WordPress visual editor and Safari 3</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/wordpress-visual-editor-and-safari-3" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-27T17:21:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-11-27T17:21:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-11-27:/blog/wordpress-visual-editor-and-safari-3</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, to put it bluntly, Safari butchers the visual editor in WordPress.

I can honestly say it's extremely "wow".  It's got a slick interface to configuring things like DNS, DHCP, apache, Open Directory (which is essentially OpenLDAP+Kerberos) and some other goodies.  All wrapped up in a nice GUI interface (I've never seen Apache so nice to configure before).  Extremely slick.  Very cool stuff.  I could easily replace my Annvix-based LAN server with this puppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it's expensive.  I mean &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; expensive, for someone like me.  I've got a few machines here, and a whole pile of virtual machines.  My LAN server runs DHCP, DNS, OpenLDAP, Samba... lots of stuff.  I've got cross-system backups, LDAP-based authentication, NFS exports and auto-mounting.  Webservers, MySQL and PostgreSQL servers scattered around... wikis, blogs... you name it.  I've got a lot of stuff going on here.  OS X server could definitely simplify a few of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, at a 10-client license (that's 10 concurrent file-sharing connections, which is enough for me), I'm looking at about $500.  That in itself isn't such a bad price.  The problem is you need a machine capable of running it.  Ideally, that would be an &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/canadastore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=7E50163B&amp;amp;nclm=Xserve"&gt;Xserve&lt;/a&gt;, but starting at $3499CAD, that's expensive.  Sure, it comes with OS X server (web page says 10.4 server... I wonder if that's a typeo... must be).  It's not a bad configuration either: 2 64bit dual-core Xeon processors, 1GB RAM, and a single 80GB SATA HDD.  All wrapped up in a nice 1U machine -- perfect for my rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here though is that it would need more RAM and new HDDs... let's face it, Apple could keep the 80GB drive.  I'd want that puppy loaded with 3 500GB drives.  And a minimum of 2GB RAM, but probably more.  All of a sudden I'm over $6000CAD if I bought the stuff through Apple (with 750GB drives instead of 500GB drives).  That's a half-decent used car around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but a similar spec'd opteron-based system from Sun is quite a bit cheaper.  I could get a Sun Fire X4100 M2 with dual opteron processors (dual-core I believe) with 4GB RAM and 4 SATA drive capability for just over $5000CAD.  Or go with a trusty Sun Fire X2100 with a single dual-core opteron, 4GB RAM for $2000CAD (and let me tell you, those Sun Fire X2100's are impressive... I have one and love it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Apple doesn't give you a choice of a "lower-end" machine, you're stuck with the quad-core xeon... not necessarily a bad thing but if all you're going to be doing is providing room for backups and file sharing, LDAP authentication, DNS and DHCP, and an intranet website, the price tag is hefty.  The geek in me would want the Sun Fire X4100, but the practical person in me knows an X2100 would be more than sufficient.  And then I could toss Annvix or Mandriva on there and have the OS for no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I have a powermac G5 that is capable of running Leopard Server -- it would cost me $500 to get it up and running with no other hardware cost.  But my concern is that if/when that machine dies, what then?  That G5 has a few months of AppleCare left, sure, but after that it's anyone's guess how long it'll last.  Probably quite a few years yet, but there's no guarantee.  By using Annvix or Mandriva, if my LAN server dies, I can buy a low-end X2100 and replace it with little cost.  If I used 10.5 server on my G5 and it died, I'm looking at about $6000 just to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the geek in me would love to get my hands on and play with Leopard Server and use it for my LAN server, the practical person in me thinks it's too much risk.  At least with the consumer desktops it's no so bad... if my macbook dies, the replacement cost after 3 years is reasonable.  But would you really want to run an iMac as a server?  I could go for a mini I guess, and it probably has enough juice to actually perform all the tasks it would need to perform... reasonably.  Replacement cost for it wouldn't be so bad, at least compared to an xserve (and it would fit in my rack reasonably well too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the bottom line is that Apple has a spanking nice product with Leopard Server, and the xserve is entirely too cool.  But for the average guy, the cost just doesn't justify it.  My Annvix box can do everything that Leopard Server can with a little bit of effort (and I stress little)... it just doesn't look as cool and you're stuck with the CLI (which, in my opinion, is great).  And the cost is extremely reasonable.  I suppose this is the same argument for Linux vs Windows servers except with Windows you pay through the nose for licensing, but can largely run it on anything you want.  With Apple, the pricing is quite reasonable for the software, but you get nailed with the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fun and interesting 20 minutes, I'll give it that, but I have no (practical) desire to spend more than that on it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>AutoFS support in Leopard</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/autofs-support-in-leopard" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-31T09:55:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-31T09:55:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-10-31:/blog/autofs-support-in-leopard</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seems like I'm writing quite a bit about OS X.

Sorry, it's so new and there's some cool features in it.  Like AutoFS finally working (more or less) properly out of the box.  It works, but the NFS exports need to be exported to the server with the "insecure" option.  I don't like that very much, but that's the only way it currently works.  Some sites I've looked at recommend doing something like this in /etc/exports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
/mnt/export *(rw,insecure,no_root_squash)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's absolutely horrifying.  For one, there's no real reason to have no_root_squash.  For two, you didn't &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; want to export everything like that, right?  Best have some IP restrictions in there or something.  I'd use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
/mnt/export odin(rw,insecure)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead.  Replace "odin" with an IP address if you don't use DNS (I have my own DNS domain for my LAN simply due to all the machines and virtual machines here).  Then you can poke around, on the leopard box, in /net/foo/mnt/export to get all your files, without any additional configuration on the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, /net is a "hidden" directory, so it won't show up in the Finder, and there's nothing in the sidebar about the connected servers, which sucks.  PathFinder is worse tho... if you navigate to /net (by telling it to show invisibles), all of a sudden every share shows up as mounted in the PathFinder sidebar.  Ouch!  To make life easier, you may want to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cd ~
$ ln -s /net .
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can navigate it in the Finder via ~/net/.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>OS X Browser Comparison</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/os-x-browser-comparison" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-29T21:04:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-29T21:04:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-10-29:/blog/os-x-browser-comparison</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, my beloved &lt;a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com/"&gt;Saft&lt;/a&gt; is still not updated for Safari 3... there's a beta for Safari 3 that works on Tiger, but nothing that works on Leopard.

Which makes Safari almost useless, although I did find in the History menu bar the option "Reopen All Windows From Last Session".  Well, thanks for making a half-assed attempt there... no quick key shortcut, no option to make that the default behaviour in the preferences... nothing.  Utterly lame.  And without Saft to automate that for me, Safari looks less and less appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, now I've decided to do an impromptu benchmark (in terms of memory and CPU utilization when idle) of Camino, Safari, and OmniWeb.  I had settled on using Camino as the default browser, but now I'm not so sure.With the same 14 tabs open in each browser, Camino is idling at 21.9% CPU, 23 threads, and 143.43MB of real memory.  Safari on the other hand is utilizing 0.5% CPU, 14 threads, and 149.12MB memory.  OmniWeb is using 0.6% CPU, 25 threads, and 178.87MB memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno... the memory usage is roughly the same across the board, but the CPU usage while idling makes me think Safari or OmniWeb.  I like the fact that Safari is using less memory but.. well, with 7GB of RAM I can afford to be excessive.  =)  Both load pages with relatively the same speed it feels like, so I think that OmniWeb with it's much superior session features will be the default for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>OS X 10.5... installs and thoughts</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/os-x-105-installs-and-thoughts" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-28T21:02:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-28T21:02:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-10-28:/blog/os-x-105-installs-and-thoughts</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I did my duty on Friday and went out and grabbed a copy of OS X 10.5 (Leopard).

As I was finishing my SuperDuper backups, I was poking around on Apple's support forums and heard about all the horror stories people have had.  Two essential apps for me, DayLite and FileMaker, didn't have Leopard-aware updates at the time; FileMaker won't apparently until sometime next month and DayLite has a beta available now.  Apparently, only a few minor things are wrong with FileMaker that are, for me easily circumvented (change the region from Canada to USA and I was up and running).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why so many people were having problems.  I suppose most of them either do an upgrade or archive/install.  I do neither.  I use SuperDuper to make an exact clone of my drives, then do a complete fresh install.  Yeah, it's more time-consuming to re-install everything, copy preferences and other associated data over, etc. but you know what?  It's dang-near fool-proof.  I've done three machines so far, and all three are up and running just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial observations are that 10.5 seems a lot faster.  Now, my desktop is no slouch... it's a 2.66GHz quad-core xeon Mac Pro with 7GB of RAM (the rationale for the RAM is VMware).  Whether this is due to 10.5 itself or the fact that a whole bunch of crap I had installed before that I no longer have installed (because I don't use it, forgot to uninstall it before, whatever) -- it remains to be seen if the system will feel faster 6mos from now or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few issues I had read about.  Keychains were a big item on the Apple forums.  Pretty simple tho.  Copy the old keychain (say, vdanen.keychain) from the backup to ~/Library/Keychains/.  Open Keychain Access, add the keychain, then set it to be the default keychain.  Voila, instant pre-upgrade keychain support.  Not sure why so many people were having problems with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copying relevant files from ~/Library/Preferences/ and ~/Library/Application Support/ took some time, but the preference files are pretty well named (for the most part).  Whatever I missed before (easy to tell when you launch an app), I simply copied over after closing the app.  Re-launch, and back to pre-upgrade settings.  Don't forget /Library/Application Support/ and /Library/Preferences/ too, for the system-wide stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All applications seem to be working pretty good, with the FileMaker caveat I noted before.  PathFinder seems a little sensitive and has crashed on me twice now.  Everything else seems fairly solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaces is slick.  Could be better, could also be a whole lot worse.  I like it.  The new Terminal completely rocks.  I love the tabbed support, the Window Group support, and the themes.  The preferences are also laid out in a more sane manner now.  Totally impressed with it and have no need to use iTerm anymore.  (Hint: for those who use mutt in the Terminal, Osaka-Mono 13pt is an awesome font to use (14pt, depending on your screen size and how large you like stuff... it's in with the Additional Fonts package so make sure you install it (I believe it's supposed to be a japanese font of some sort).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutt compiled fine, fink works.  Irssi I had to compile without perl support... there doesn't seem to be any perl development files installed, which is odd.  Not sure if Tiger came with them installed, or if I obtained them via ActivePerl or fink or something, but a few pretty important header files were missing.  I hadn't realized that subversion came bundled, so now I have svn in both /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin; not a huge deal tho.  Oh wierd.  I just realized that the perl header files are in /System/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/.  Sometimes the OS X way of placing files wierds me out.  What's wrong with /usr/include?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ssh is interesting... a dialog box pops up and asks for your ssh key passphrase and offers to add it to the keychain.  This may allow me to get rid of SSHKeychain which, while being a decent app, had the nerve to start sucking up massive amounts of CPU every once in a while... a bug that's persisted across multiple versions.  I won't mind if it's gone, although I need to look into things a bit more as I'd like to know how it's handling ssh-agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it feels pretty much the same.  The new dock is cute.. it's so small on my machine that I only use it to note what apps are open; I never actually use it to launch anything (LaunchBar is way too cool not to use it).  Time Machine looks interesting, although the drive I plan to use it on has my SuperDuper clone on it right now so I haven't played with it much.  The Stacks stuff looks... different.  Can't really see myself using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Finder is really cool.  If it had tab support, I could probably replace Path Finder with it completely.  I like the remote share browser, that seems to be working quite well although I haven't tried screen sharing yet.  Also seems a lot snappier than the Tiger Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I'll find other issues and cool things over the weeks to come.  Personally, I'm waiting for a new version of Saft to come out.  The new Safari seems pretty much like the old one to me.  It's ok, and has been my default browser for a long time.  I forgot how useless it was without Saft tho.  Hello... Apple?  Saving browser window sessions?  This is an absolute must!  If I have 10 sites open, I want those 10 same sites &lt;i&gt;back&lt;/i&gt; if I have to reboot, or if Safari crashes, or whatever.  I don't want to start with a new blank window.  Sheesh.  Using Camino right now for the day-to-day browsing until Saft gets updated.  I prefer the look of Safari (doesn't feel so "alien") to Camino (which is pretty good, but the clickable buttons look off), or Firefox (which is as alien as it gets).  New version of OmniWeb out tho, so maybe I'll see if the stability issues in previous versions has been worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it doesn't seem to bad to me.  I don't get what all the fuss is, but I guess with all these new Windows converts and other Mac users that seem to think Apple is "all that" but still don't have any technical clue, there are a few who would have issues.  For me, other than having stuff in weird locations, it's no different than a Linux install (yup...  unless it's Annvix, it's &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; a fresh install).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Macintosh's Witnesses</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/macintoshs-witnesses" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-08-21T21:21:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-08-21T21:21:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-08-21:/blog/macintoshs-witnesses</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This comic from &lt;a href="http://www.joyoftech.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/998b.html"&gt;The Joy of Tech&lt;/a&gt; is awesome.

It's an OS X app and it works really good.  I've run it on my desktop, but now that I have a spare OS X machine that I've turned into a bit of a server, I've put PhoneValet on there.  With PhoneValet Anywhere, I still get notifications on my desktop as to who is calling so that I don't have to lean over and look at the phone, which was one of the original reasons for purchasing it.  However, with PhoneValet on the server, in another room, I have no way of telling if there's a voicemail message unless I check my email which can be sporadic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no functionality in PhoneValet to allow for it to tell a remote *Anywhere client that a voicemail arrived, but it does have support to run AppleScripts after a voicemail has been left.  So after an hour or so of fiddling around, I came up with a nice solution.  It's not the cleanest solution, but it works.  It involves using AppleScript, a shell script, and the growlnotify commandline client.  It's a little convoluted, but works quite well enough.  I did initially think to use ssh and ssh keys, but missed that growlnotify has support for listening to remote systems so opted to use that instead (although for receiving growl notifications from Linux boxes, using ssh/ssh keys would work very well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in the same situation and up for the challenge, read on.
On the system that you want to receive the notifcations, install Growl.  Go into System Preferences -&amp;gt; Growl and hit the Network tab.  Check off the "Listen for incoming notifications" and set a Server password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the system that PhoneValet is running on, make sure Growl, and the growlnotify commandline program (in the Extras folder) are installed and create a shellscript.  I called this ~/bin/gnotify_voicemail with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
msg="$*"
/usr/local/bin/growlnotify -n gnotify -I /Applications/iSync.app -H remote.host.com \
-P secret -s -m "$*"  Voicemail has arrived!
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This needs to be edited to suit your system.  The remote host (-H; remote.host.com in this case) is the host to connect to and you need to supply the password you used previously (in this case "secret").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all you need to do is create the AppleScript.  PhoneValet looks for the voicemail-related AppleScripts in /Library/Application Support/Parliant/AppleScripts/VoiceMail/ so I created "Growl Voicemail.scpt" there with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
--This script calls the gnotify shellscript which in turn calls growlnotify on the remote system(s) in order to indicate that a voicemail has arrived

on process_voicemail_message(callerName, callerNumber, soundFilePath, callTime, lineName, domesticAreaCode, domesticNumber, mailboxName)

    set call_date to date callTime
    -- format the caller name
    if (callerName = "") then
        set cname to "Unknown"
    else
        set cname to callerName
    end if

    do shell script "/Users/vdanen/bin/gnotify_voicemail Voicemail from " &amp; cname &amp; " at " &amp; callTime

end process_voicemail_message
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, change the location of the shellscript to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, fire up PhoneValet, go into Preferences -&amp;gt; AppleScripts, hit the "Voice Mail" tab and check off the "Growl Voicemail.scpt" script, save and exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also test the shellscript real quick by executing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ~/bin/gnotify_voicemail "This is a test message"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure the script is executable, of course.  When you execute that, you should see a growl popup on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now whenever you receive a voicemail you should get a popup on your workstation (or the computer that PhoneValet is not running on).  You might want to modify the Growl preferences for this so that the popups are sticky, so to do that go into the Growl preference pane, go into the Applications tab, scroll down and look for "gnotify" and make sure it's enabled.  Change the Display to "Brushed" or something similar and make sure Sticky is enabled.  Now even if the voice mail was left a minute ago or 10 hours ago, the growl notification will remain on your screen for you to see when you get back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this also assumes your workstation is on 24/7 to receive the Growl notifications.  If it's not on, I'm pretty sure you won't get the notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, quick and hurried write-up (it's late and I want to go to bed), but hopefully that'll give you enough to get going.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Using mutt on OS X</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/using-mutt-on-os-x" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-03-09T16:01:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-09T16:01:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-03-09:/blog/using-mutt-on-os-x</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I put up a &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/Using_mutt_on_OS_X"&gt;full-feature tutorial on how to use mutt on OS X&lt;/a&gt; (most of it is applicable to any other OS, of course... there are very few bits that are OS X specific).

Before I started using Linux, I was using OS/2.  I went to it from DOS/Win3.1... skipped Windows95 altogether.  OS/2 was the absolute best OS back in the day (as far as I'm concerned) and being a nostalgic (and sometimes bored) idiot, I decided to pull out my Warp 4 CDs and see if I could install it in Parallels.  I succeeded... to some extent.  Now that I have OS/2 installed I can honestly say I have no idea what I would ever use it for anymore.  I also couldn't get the (what should be) the simplest things installed (i.e. OS/2 builds of Firefox, even something as simple as lynx was crapping out on me).  Granted, I didn't spend too much time tweaking it (I'm not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bored).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, here's a quick rundown of the things I had to do in order to make it work.  Had to do a bit of googling to find all the bits, and this is what worked for me (note, this is Parallels on OS X)...Ok, here's the steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Copy the disk images from the Warp4 CD; in particular you want DISK0.DSK, DISK1-CD.DSK, and DISK2.DSK, in the /diskimgs/os2/35/ directory
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; rename each of these files to a .dmg file (i.e. DISK0.DSK becomes disk0.dmg) -- make sure you can mount each of them in the Finder
&lt;li&gt; if you can mount them, unmount them and rename them to .fdd (i.e. disk0.dmg becomes disk0.fdd)
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Create the new virtual machine, set the OS type to OS/2.  Set the primary drive to be 2GB (I used 1.9GB to make sure OS/2 could read it)
&lt;li&gt; Set the CD drive to &lt;i&gt;/Library/Parallels/Tools/vmtools.iso&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Set the floppy drive to &lt;i&gt;~/Desktop/disk0.fdd&lt;/i&gt; or wherever you saved your floppy disk images
&lt;li&gt; Make sure the machine is set to boot from the floppy first, then boot the machine.  You'll make your way through the three floppies; when the installer asks for the next floppy, just use *Devices-&gt;Floppy-&gt;Connect Image* and pick the disk it's asking for
&lt;li&gt; When the installer wants the OS/2 CD inserted, do the same thing and use *Devices-&gt;CD/DVD-ROM 1&gt;-&gt;[Drive name]* to have it use the physical CD-ROM (I tried with a disk image created via Disk Utility but it didn't work)
&lt;li&gt; Use the advanced install and format your drive to HPFS
&lt;li&gt; You'll probably have to reboot and go through all these steps again (stupid installer) after you create the filesystem and partition the drive
&lt;li&gt; When you've got everything installed, use the *GENGRADD* SVGA driver for the graphics card
&lt;li&gt; For the TCP/IP settings, when it comes to it, connect the floppy device to &lt;i&gt;/Library/Parallels/Tools/vmtools.fdd&lt;/i&gt; to have it pull the network driver off the image; this should be the "RTL8029 PCI Ethernet Adapter" (PCIND.OS2).
&lt;li&gt; Once the install is complete, reboot, and use the vmware tools installer once you've brought OS/2 up in order to install the mouse driver (&lt;i&gt;D:\DRIVERS\MOUSE\OS2\INSTALL.CMD&lt;/i&gt;)
&lt;/ul&gt;

I must admit, I find it pretty neat that I have OS/2 running again.  It looks awful, the UI is horrid, but it's the OS/2 I fondly remember (although I don't remember it looking quite this bad).  At any rate, I spent a bit of time trying to download stuff off of hobbes to get installed and pretty much none of it worked, and I didn't have the patience to try and figure out what I needed to do to make it work.  It was enough that I got it installed.  I had tried once a few years ago in VMware and couldn't make it work.

So, if nothing else, I spent an evening tinkering, did absolutely nothing productive, but now I can show it to my kid and make her thankful for good UIs like GNOME and Aqua.</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>MacFUSE and sshfs</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/macfuse-and-sshfs" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-01-30T10:18:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-01-30T10:18:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-01-30:/blog/macfuse-and-sshfs</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My one gripe a few months ago about OS X was the lack of sshfs and fuse support...

I wrote about this for a TechRepublic tip quite a few months ago and when I did I was pretty ticked that it didn't work on OS X (sshfs absolutely rocks!).  Anyways, the fine folks at Google have created &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/"&gt;MacFUSE&lt;/a&gt; and I got around to installing it this morning.  Very slick.  Unfortunately, the sshfs.app that you can use with it doesn't have a very nice frontend, and this other GUI frontend I found called &lt;a href="http://jan.prima.de/SecureRemoteDisk.html"&gt;Secure Remote Disk&lt;/a&gt; is only marginally better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading a thread on the PathFinder forums (sshfs volumes don't show up as volumes in PathFinder yet although they do in the Finder), I saw a shellscript posted that was a little better than the quicky I whipped up, so it inspired me to write an even better one that puts these GUI apps to shame (I think).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can grab it here: &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/files/sshfsmount"&gt;sshfsmount&lt;/a&gt;.  Save it to disk, make it executable, and put it somewhere like ~/bin or /usr/local/bin.  The options are pretty straightforward, use "sshfsmount -h" to get help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others would ask for donations (ala the Secure Remote Disk fellow), but it took me maybe 20 minutes to whip this up, so I won't ask for any donations.  &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, if you do feel like donating, I won't stop you.  =)  Hit &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/"&gt;the main page&lt;/a&gt; for a PayPal button if you're so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I suppose this would work as a login item and can probably be called via applescript to mount multiple sshfs mount points at login although I haven't tried.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>MAMP and PHP Development on the Mac</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mamp-and-php-development-on-the-mac" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-11-22T23:31:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-22T23:31:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-11-22:/blog/mamp-and-php-development-on-the-mac</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a lot of my web development lately on my macbook pro, but the problem is that I do the work locally, then have to rsync it to my Linux-based server to see the results.

Not a huge deal, but a PITA.  So I decided I was going to look into running the "stack" on my mbp directly, so I could do all the development locally... great for when I'm at the in-law's place without a direct internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been reading about &lt;a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php"&gt;MAMP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/a&gt;, both are providers of the "stack" for OS X (XAMPP actually also works on Linux and Windows too).  I chose MAMP because it has a more recent version of PHP available (5.1.6 vs. 5.0.5 in XAMPP).  I'm hoping they'll update soon to 5.2.0 since that's what my webserver will be running in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with MAMP, however, is that you have to run the stupid MAMP application to actually start the apache and mysql daemons; it doesn't provide support to have them started on their own at system startup.  &lt;a href="http://forum.mamp.info/viewtopic.php?t=68"&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; on the MAMP forum gives you some clues, but not enough.  For one, they set it up as an "on-demand" thing, triggered by a user login.  This is fine for a desktop machine I suppose, but not so good for someone, say, running an Xserve and using MAMP as their production "stack".  So I took the info, did some fiddling, and got it to start at boot.  Unfortunately, when you install MAMP (as a user), some ownership of files go to you that can't go to you if you want it to start as a system service.  You'll need to add two plists to /Library/LaunchDaemons (I'll get to that in a moment), and you'll also have to change some ownership of files.  The first thing to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo chown -R mysql:admin /Applications/MAMP/db/mysql
$ sudo chown -R mysql:admin /Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to grant ownership of the database files to user mysql (which is what the database will run as instead of, say, user joe (aka YOU)), and the second is to give user mysql write permissions to the temporary file directory where mysql wants to create it's socket file (so as to communicate locally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plists you need are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/files/6/62/Apache2.plist"&gt;/Library/LaunchDaemons/apache2.plist&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/files/5/54/Mysql.plist"&gt;/Library/LaunchDaemons/mysql.plist&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second assumes you'll be running mysql on the standard mysql port (and not the wierd non-standard port they use by default).  Reboot and you're good to go (make sure those plist files are owned root:admin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was one good thing... don't even get my started on the new Zend Studio 5.5 beta that is "supposedly" a universal binary (hello... we need universal &lt;em&gt;libs&lt;/em&gt; too people!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>BBEdit Codeless Language Module for RPM Spec Files</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/bbedit-codeless-language-module-for-rpm-spec-files" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-09-07T21:58:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-09-07T21:58:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-09-07:/blog/bbedit-codeless-language-module-for-rpm-spec-files</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The news is out and any OS X-using developers out there are probably aware that BareBones provided a new major update of &lt;a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml"&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt; today.

I downloaded it and was playing around with it (this is a paid upgrade so I've got some time to evaluate it although the upgrade cost is only $30) when I starting looking at the Codeless Language Modules.  I wanted to add RPM spec syntax support to BBEdit quite some time ago and had (wrongly) thought I needed to pull out XCode and actually &lt;i&gt;code&lt;/i&gt; something.  I'm far too lazy for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I downloaded the SDK again today and found these Codeless Language Modules which are just plist files (or XML documents) that tell BBEdit what to highlight and what not to, etc.  BBEdit doesn't have overly sophisticated highlighting anyways (come on, can't we have more than four colors?), but I like a lot of what BBEdit can do and while I normally use joe or vim, sometimes it's easier to whiz my way around a document with my scroll wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, tonight I made a "CLM" for the RPM spec syntax.  Not sure how many people using OS X are also using it to edit .spec files, but since BBEdit can do remote edits via FTP/SFTP I figured what the heck, I'd give it a go.  As an aside, I've also found some CLM's for Mutt's configuration files, Exim's config, and Apache's config.  For other stuff as well, like LUA and whatnot, but there was nothing else I was really interested in.  For anyone out there who's interested, here's my &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bbedit+codeless+language+plist&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N"&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; where I found the other modules from.&lt;/p&gt;

Email's been around for ages, so why are email clients still so crappy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August I switched from the OS X Mail.app (in Tiger) to mutt because Tiger's Mail.app was too stinking slow.  I get lots of mail... I mean &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of mail.  My incoming mbox for this month so far is 102MB.  The number of messages in that mbox?  8427.  That's roughly 400 messages a day.  Tiger's Mail was dying under that load (when Panther's Mail didn't... it's due to Mail now using individual files for each message rather than an mbox (thanks, Spotlight)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mutt was so nice... so fast... so nice...  like an old friend.  I looked at most of the available OS X mail clients, and all of them were lacking something.. some lacked threading support (WTF?  are you kidding me?!?), some worked only with PGP and not GnuPG, some just plain old sucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, recently due to some problems at the colo with a bad switch, mail deliveries from here have been somewhat problematic and I was getting hit by the default OS X maximum-number-of-processes-per-user issue (only 100 procs per user), which was quickly being eaten by silly little sendmail processes (using postfix here to relay the mail from the local machine through the colo, for it to deliver to the end recipient).  So, I figured... it's been a year, I'll see how some things look.
Well, the obvious first choice was Thunderbird.  The one major drawback to Thunderbird is the lack of integration with the OS X address book (and keychain).  But I was willing to look past that.  Well, having played with an imported my mail and everything into Thunderbird over the last day, I can tell you that it sucks far more than just lack of AB integration.  What an awfully slow, strange, and (quite frankly) ugly program!  Ick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've cranked up my maximum procs from 100 to 512 (softlimit) and 2048 (hardlimit).  If nothing else, those sendmail threads won't be wrecking my terminal sessions.  And it's back to mutt.  I don't even have the patience to try anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird may work great on Windows, considering it's major competition is outlook which is even worse, but on OS X it's rather awful.  And don't even start with the "Linux has better mail clients" because it doesn't... kmail is an awful program (and it inherits the rather distastful KDE look-n-feel), and Evolution while being ok, just doesn't do it for me.  Been a while, so maybe it's better, but I really don't feel like reading mail on my laptop... I'd rather use my desktop machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe next year there will be better mail clients.  I just don't get how a CLI client like mutt is so far superior to all these new/new-ish email clients that are out there.  Is it that hard to write a good GUI client that isn't slower than... well... I won't say.  Anyways, it's slow.  I'll take my fetchmail/procmail/SpamAssassin/postfix/mutt setup any day over what's currently available.  It just astounds me as to what people are willing to settle for.  I guess if you don't deal with email that much you probably don't care, but email is my connection to the world and work (can't really pick up the phone to call fcrozat to ask him something about a firefox security issue).  It has to work and it has to be a no-brainer and it has to be fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to find a good GUI client to fill that criteria.  The only GUI mail client that I've &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; really liked was PMMail/2 for OS/2... now that was a damn fine email client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you're on OS X (Tiger) and ever see a message on the console or terminal about not being able to fork and "resource temporarily unavailable", wander over to here and read this: &lt;a href="http://ruminate.net/pdm/mt/os_x_tips/os_x_tiger_104_process_limits_solution.html"&gt;http://ruminate.net/pdm/mt/os_x_tips/os_x_tiger_104_process_limits_solution.html&lt;/a&gt; .  Very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic jist of it is to use "launchctl" to determine what your limits are set to (ie. "launchctl limit") and then create a /etc/launchd.conf file that contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
limit maxproc 512 2048
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which will bump up the softlimit and hardlimit respectively to 512 and 2048.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>I feel so swordfish</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/i-feel-so-swordfish" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-05-10T12:38:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-05-10T12:38:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-05-10:/blog/i-feel-so-swordfish</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever seen that movie Swordfish with Hally Berry(sp?) and John Travolta?

I like that movie.  Appeals to me.  Hackers... security... mmm...  even if it is a little.. outlandish in parts.  Anyways, my favourite scene is when he goes to the big house and sits in front of that computer with 8 or 10 monitors attached to it... his "hack station".  Whoah.  That's my kinda machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my primary desktop machine is my dual 1.8GHz G5... nothing overly fancy in terms of the hardware itself (it's a few years old now) but it does everything I need.  It's always run two 20" LCD displays but the other day for kicks I decided to try stuffing another video card in that box.. just cuz I can and because I have some spare monitors kicking around that aren't being used.  I got the Mac edition Radeon 9200 PCI card (I suppose I could have gone for a higher-end AGP card to replace the nvidia card that's in here now but my idea was to expand, not replace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after sticking that puppy in there, hooking up another 19" and 20" LCD monitors, I'm feeling rather swordfish.  I thought dual-head was the bomb (and I've been doing that for years, starting off with two 15" CRT monitors running off old 8MB PCI cards "back in the day").  I do have to admit, however, that it worked a lot smoother than I've ever experienced with X.  Turned it on and bang, there they were.  Minor tweaks (optimal resolutions and re-placement) but that's it.  Otherwise, it works quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only downside is that Quartz Extreme doesn't run on the PCI cards (Apple disabled it for performance reasons I guess... PCI bus is too slow and I don't have the faster PCI express or whatever it's called).  So that's disappointing.  I tried this program called PCI Extreme which is supposed to enable Quartz Extreme support on the PCI card, but (although System Profiler tells me it's now enabled) it didn't do much for performance.  WoW stutters like crazy on those displays, but when I move it to my primary (original) monitors, it works great (despite the fact this nvidia AGP card is a 64MB card and the radeon is 128MB).  Oh well.  Works great for more terminals which is what I really wanted (I routinely have about a dozen or more terminals open at a time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been using this since last night and it is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; nice.  Like I said... I feel swordfish.  Need a few more to get the "full effect" but dangit... four monitors on one box is more than a reasonable person would ever use so I guess I've got my "geek on" with just this.  =)  Who the hell needs multiple machines when you can run four monitors off a single machine?

Not good enough for me, but a good first step.  I've been waiting for VMWare to step up to the plate and offer a Mac version of their workstation product so I can run Linux, Windows, etc. on a mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait!  Today a beta of &lt;a href="http://www.parallels.com/"&gt;Parallels&lt;/a&gt; is available for OS X.    Now, I've never heard of these guys before.  I've used a lot of different desktop virtualization software: VMWare, VirtualPC (which stunk), and Qemu (I've tried the Q frontend on OS X and it's ok).  So this thing has a beta you can download and trial.  Currently, I'm installing Windows 2000 in it (my XP disk is an upgrade disk and I can't seem to swap real CDs during install).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tip...  you can use an ISO image for the CD (like you can in VMWare), but I couldn't make it see a real CD-ROM/DVD-ROM device.  Tried pointing it to the mountpoint, etc. and nothing.  I did finally figure out that you can stick in your install CD, let it mount, then pop to the terminal and type "mount" to see what you've got mounted.  In my case I saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
/dev/disk1s0 on /Volumes/W2PFPP_EN
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to unmount this in disk utility or anything, the CD will get ejected so you need to do "sudo umount /Volumes/W2PFPP_EN" (or whatever it is) to unmount it but leave the CD in the drive.  Then you can tell Parallels to use "/dev/disk1s0" (or whatever the partition device is) and it'll work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Parallels locks the device so you can't eject it so for me, to get XP in there, I need to install 2000 first (because my disk is an upgrade disk).  Kinda sucks, but whatever.  If the upgrade from 2000 to XP craps out, I'll just 2000 in there (doesn't matter what I use, I just want Win[something] in there for Quicken and QuickBooks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be able to tell soon how this thing stacks up to VMWare.  The price is about $50.00 compared to (I believe) VMWare's $99, but if VMWare came out with a beta for OS X today, I'd drop Parallels in a heart-beat.  I've been using VMWare since 2.0 and love it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Zend Studio vs. Komodo</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/zend-studio-vs-komodo" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-11-09T19:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-11-09T19:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-11-09:/blog/zend-studio-vs-komodo</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, as per my last entry, I'm gonna do some comparisons between Komodo 3.5 and Zend Studio 5.0.

Both have recently been released, both are "heavy weight" IDE's (Integrated Development Environments).  Zend Studio deals particularly with PHP... that's Zend's bread and butter, so it makes sense.  Komodo, on the other hand, is more of a programmer's editor in that it does PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, XSLT, and Tcl.  Of course, you can use either as an editor for other languages, but most of the IDE features beyond syntax highlighting would be, obviously, unavailable.  They both weigh in at about the same size, which is interesting... I actually thought that Zend would be bigger due to the inclusion of PHP, etc. but then again, Komodo does deal with a larger number of languages.  The proof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
vdanen@odin:/Applications/Tools/ &gt;% du -sh Zend\ Studio\ 5
82M     Zend Studio 5
vdanen@odin:/Applications/Tools/ &gt;% du -sh Komodo.app     
93M     Komodo.app
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, on with the comparison!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing is how they open.  Not a big deal, but Komodo has this neat "Start Page".  It shows you recently opened files and projects, links to help tutorials for the different languages it supports and demos.  This is something I always liked about Komodo.  Zend just opens up into a blank document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each has a multi-pane view; by default Komodo's panels are off, but there are buttons to toggle them.  With Komodo, on the left you get the file tree view split into two tabs: Projects and Code.  Without a defined project, the Projects tab is empty.  The Code browser shows you currently opened files.  Clicking the triangle next to the file name will break down functions, variables, and whatnot.  Double-click on any of these will take you to where they are defined in the code.  There's even a little box below the code browser that shows you function comments if you defined them in the code.  There's a search box to help you find what you're looking for and the list is slimmed down as you type.  Nice feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zend, on the other hand, also uses the left panel to inspect files and projects.  It's inspector isn't quite as nice... it shows functions and included files, like Komodo, but doesn't show comments.  Double-clicking will take you to where the function is defined in the code.  Alas, unlike Komodo, it doesn't show variables.  One thing it does have that's kind of neat is a "PHP Inspector" that will let you look at all the defined functions and constants that PHP uses.  It's kind of goofy tho.. it needs to open the documentation with a browser, but the shell script it uses doesn't seem to work... when I pointed it to Safari directly (unfortunately, you can't just point it an app, but have to dig deep into it... for instance, to use Safari as the browser I used "/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari"... not very nice) it opened a second instance of Safari and made Saft think it had crashed.  Uh oh.  Good thing nothing happened to the first Safari process or I'd be re-typing all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's irritating that the ./runBrowser.sh definition that's in there doesn't work... from the commandline, it works fine.  I'll have to file a bug about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zend, the right pane is for debug output... this lets you see what your script is doing.  The bottom pane is for debug messages and there's also a debug window that will let you inspect variables, watches, stack, breakpoints, and the output buffer from the debug session.  If you're note debugging, a simple click on the window name will minimize them and allow you to see more of your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Komodo, the bottom pane is for various informational views; breakpoints, command output, and "SCC Output" (or the output of source code control stuff... cvs, subversion, etc.).  One neat thing with Komodo is the right pane... it's the Toolbox browser.  This was a new feature in Komodo 3, IIRC, and I never really got to play with it much although it seemed really cool.  The Toolbox contains snippets of code; the samples show HTML snippets that when you double-click get added to the code.  You can even configure URLs as snippets.. a quick way to get to some online documentation.  Defining a toolbox entry is easy... create a new snippet, add the code you want it to insert, give it a name, and you can even bind it to a hotkey.  This is actually an extremely slick feature... you can have it so that at the touch of a key (say ALT-CTRL-F) you could have it put in a function definition complete with a section for code comments, etc.  Zend needs to get a feature like this (man, I had completely forgotten about this feature!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait!  It does have a feature like this... just not as prominent.  Nice thing to stumble across.  Zend has a feature called Code Snippets and it can update the snippets from Zend's website.  Damn!  I wish I had noticed this before.  Zend!  What's wrong with you?  Why not make this more obvious?!?  Looks like the code snippets are user-contributed to boot, so you can keep getting new code snippets and they're broken down into different categories.  Wow.  Now I'm impressed.  Go to &lt;b&gt;Edit-&amp;gt;Show Snippets&lt;/b&gt; to check this out.  I don't like the fact that it floats in another window... I much prefer how Komodo has their Toolbox laid out, but I'll take what I can get.  This is something I'm going to be exploring a lot more of soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much it for the interface.  The Komodo interface looks nicer, but it's Mozilla-based rather than some java thing.  Yes, that means that, like Zend, Komodo isn't very "OS X-ish", but it still looks clean.  I find the layout looks better than Zend's does.  You can always tell a java app... they all look kinda... ugly.  Komodo just looks like an app running under X11, which is ok with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm... looks like Zend's Code Analyzer function has taken a step backwards with the final release, or they're being more picky.  BTW, the Code Analyzer is awesome... I find it extremely useful.  Not as good as debugging or profiling, but works really handy for looking at code and offering suggestions for things or letting you know if a defined variable is never used, etc.  Helps to make things more efficient and catches some stuff you might not otherwise notice.  But it seems a little wonky now...  for instance, it's telling me that there is an "Unused function argument: $md5 (line 384) in the following piece of code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
function mkmd5($md5)
{
    global $debug, $distar;
    $marray = array();

    foreach($md5 as $name =&gt; $val)
    {
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ummm... yeah... $md5 is being used... it's right there in the foreach().  The RC didn't pick that one up.  Then it has the balls to tell me that the value of the variable was never used.  Well, sure... it's because it's an array silly.  That's why we're using a foreach.  The value of $md5, all on it's own, is "Array" and that wouldn't be overly useful now would it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gripes aside, the code analyzer is extremely useful.  I really like it.  Komodo doesn't have anything like this... all it has is the debugger (which is ok, but I've never actually gotten it to work nicely for me in the past).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the debuggers... I can't speak for either of them.  I've tried to setup the Zend stuff in the past to make the debugger work but my firewalls keep getting in the way.  Apparently there is a way to tunnel debugging messages through an open port to work with firewalls, but I couldn't make that work either (although, in all fairness, I didn't try overly hard).  I do need to attempt to get that working, tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh!  A new feature in Zend is code folding.  This is cool, but something Komodo has had forever (so I was natually excited to see it appear in Zend).  Now, when you edit a PHP file, there's a little +/- box next to the start of a function, click on this and the function folds.  Line number count stays accurate... ie. your function may start on line 302, fold it, and the next line below the folded function is 380, so line numbering is consistant.  This is great... but... Komodo has had it for way longer, and much better to boot.  You think "function folding" is cool?  Komodo's code folding smokes it.  You can fold functions, if statements, foreach, for, while, and so on.... in fact, anything you use curly braces for, you can fold.  I'm not sure why Zend didn't carry it further... granted, folding functions and getting them out of the way is awesome, but being able to fold if statements and such as well is extremely useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Zend Studio has that I like is an SQL browser.  This allows you to connect to an SQL server (be it MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or whatever) from within Zend itself.  This is really useful when you're working on a script with database connectivity.  You can walk a tree view of the database server and look at different databases, tables, and so forth.  Now, it's just a &lt;b&gt;browser&lt;/b&gt; mind you, not an editor, so it's not a replacement for something like phpMyAdmin, but it works in a pinch.  To me, this isn't a be-all end-all feature, so it doesn't disappoint that Komodo doesn't have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Komodo has that Zend doesn't (and this lends itself more to the fact that Komodo deals with perl and other languages) is the regular expression toolkit.  This is really slick.. it helps you build regular expressions.  For someone like me who pretty much sucks with regexps, this is handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Komodo has a lot of features that Zend doesn't have, such as a GUI builder.  You can use Komodo to build GUI applications, but only with Perl/Tk, Python/Tkinter, Ruby/Tk, and Tcl/Tk.  It also gives Perl, Python, and Tcl programmers an interactive shell which lets you type code and watch it being stepped through as you go.  Kinda neat, and I can see it being exceptionally useful for the perl/python types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both IDE's can handle CVS and Subversion, which is great.  I've recently switched over from CVS to Subversion, so having the capability to commit from within the IDE is nice.  Zend's svn support works quite well.. Komodo, I'm not so sure of.  The only source control setting I seem to have with my script (which is in subversion and the working copy is in my local subversion copy) is to remove it.  That doesn't sound good at all.  Can't see anything I'd need to configure in the preferences tho.. bug maybe?  Wierd.  Using one of my old CVS files, the property inspector shows that it's update to date at revision 1.1 but the only SCC control I have is to add it.  That seems wrong too.  Methinks Komodo has some issues with SCC as it seems neither subversion nor CVS is working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the bottom line, is they both have some quirks, they're both good and capable IDEs, and they both serve different purposes.  It's a fact that Komodo's main language support is perl and python; PHP is something that is supported, but it seems to lag a little behind the support for perl and python.. maybe lag isn't the right word... PHP doesn't have some of the more powerful features that perl and python support does; but that could also be due to the language itself and the interpretters.  Suffice it to say, Komodo is meant as an all-around IDE, and it does very well at it.  I've heard rave reviews from other beta testers who are more perl or python programmers.  Me... not so much.  I avoid perl if I can, and I've never tried python.  I like PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, Zend seems to be a better fit for me.  Sure, I like some of the features Komodo has better... I like the way it looks and feels better.  But I think Zend has got a handle on what a PHP programmer wants, and Zend Studio delivers.  If you do programming with more than just one language, and/or you do PHP programming but it's not your main language you code in, Komodo is probably a better fit than Zend.  If I did more perl programming (or, rather, if I liked perl more), I'd probably end up using Komodo more just because if I used it for perl, got familiar with it, built up my code toolbox, I'd be more apt to use the same IDE to work with PHP than switch back to Zend just for PHP work.  Since almost all the coding I do is in PHP (and I can't see that letting up since I just converted a fairly hefty perl script to PHP and the dang thing runs twice as fast), I'll stick with Zend and it's arguably better PHP support.  Komodo, I'll keep it around and installed and probably play with it some more.  After all, it does syntax highlighting for almost every language out there (even my bash scripts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, to wrap this up (yes, my druid... I know you want to slaughter some furbolgs!) I feel sorry for the poor fellow you decided it wasn't worth his time to try out Zend because the installer failed so miserably (as he put it) and because it didn't conform to a nice Mac package.  His &lt;b&gt;total&lt;/b&gt; loss (my entry earlier today noted that blog entry).  If he doesn't have time to install a new version of java to play with it, he probably wouldn't have time to explore and goof off in the IDE either, and he'd be missing a whole bunch of cool features.  He uses BBEdit, and granted, so do I, but rarely for PHP code (my wife does to edit some websites, but she's not doing very much there).  BBEdit's PHP syntax highlighting is not nearly as nice as what Zend or Komodo offer, and it doesn't have the great features that both IDE's have, like debugging.  Yup, it has subversion support (which is great), but BBEdit is just a glorified text editor.  A great one, don't get me wrong, but it's not an IDE.  If you type stuff wrong in BBEdit, it won't tell you that you did... it'll just let you do it.  Komodo and Zend both give visual cues when they detect syntax errors... something that can save a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Komodo vs. Zend... well, I'd have to say that if you're just doing PHP... Zend is a clear winner.  If you're a jack-of-all-languages, you'll probably be more interested in Komodo.  If you're a total geek (or loser, take your pick) like me, then you'll want both just for kicks.  =)  Personally, I'll stick with Zend.  I keep watching what the Komodo folks are doing... it's been a long time since I used Komodo for anything other than goofing off, but that's because I changed my main platform and they didn't follow.  It only took me a little over a year of begging for an OS X version to get it, and that's gotta count for something.  My kudos to the Komodo development team.  (I also like that Komodo is a Canadian product... too bad Vancouver's gonna get all soggy for the next few months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, for what it's worth, this "review" is based on the OS X versions of the programs.  Both Zend Studio and Komdo are cross-platform, so if you work on OS X, Linux, Windows, Solaris, etc. you'll be pleased to note that you can use either program on any platform now (and I believe one license covers all platforms as well, which is nice).  For me, that's a must... being able to use the same program on my desktop, powerbook, or my libretto is really important to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Zend Studio 5.0 released</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/zend-studio-50-released" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-11-09T16:16:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-11-09T16:16:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-11-09:/blog/zend-studio-50-released</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of Komodo 3.5 for OS X, the final version of Zend Studio is now available too (upgrading as I write this).

I've been using the betas for a while, and I think it's a great upgrade over version 4.  I'm a little concerned by the comments and writeup in another blog &lt;a href="http://golgote.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2005/11/08/very-first-impressions-of-zend-studio-installation-on-mac.html#comments"&gt;In Golgota&lt;/a&gt;, that had a fairly negative write up about Zend as far as Mac integration and such goes.  I can honestly say that Zend on OS X runs &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; and the issues he's seeing, I've not seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, he complains that he can't relocate where it installs... sure you can.  I put mine in /Applications/Tools/Zend Studio 5/.  No problem there.  Then he complains that the bin/ folder contains a bunch of files.. well... ok... not a big deal really, just don't look in it.  Use the created alias or make your own (I aliased /Application/Tools/Zend Studio to /Applications/Tools/Zend Studio 5/bin/ZDE... not hard).  Then he complains about how stuffit won't archive a zip file?  Blame stuffit!  All I did was go to the resulting zip file, double-click on it in the Finder, and voila... unarchived.  That's a complaint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the java bit goes... this is noted on the Zend website.  It expliticly states (somewhere) that you need a newer java than what comes stock with OS X (I think in the product requirements section).  So what?  Just one extra download.  Doesn't interfere with the system java and happily works alongside it.  Granted, he does have a point... it would have been nice if the installer checked for the appropriate java version and then told you where to get it if it couldn't find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I'm loving Zend Studio 5.  I played a bit with Komodo after I installed it, but I think I've become to used to Zend to really feel comfortable in Komodo anymore.  Golgote has an issue with Zend?  He'd have fits with Komodo.  At least Zend provides it's own copy of PHP... Komodo doesn't, and can't use the verison of PHP installed with OS X.  Instead, it points you to a third-party PHP suite (which, granted, is well done and quite good).  Not sure about the requirements in Komodo for the other languages, although they do recommend ActivePerl, ActivePython, etc. (ie. ActiveState's builds rather than the system-installed builds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm gonna have to sit down and compare Komodo to Zend... I've got both versions fully registered (and the pro version of Komodo to boot) so it'll be interesting to see what's what.  As it stands now, I prefer Zend... but it's also because I've become comfortable with it and it's layout.  Maybe once I monkey around with Komodo as I compare them, I'll go back to it... I used to be a die-hard Komodo fan (still on the beta team, in fact.. just haven't been able to do much since it a) didn't run on OS X, and b) didn't work well with the x86_64 version of Mandriva).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Komodo 3.5 for OS X is out now</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/komodo-35-for-os-x-is-out-now" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-11-03T14:50:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-11-03T14:50:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-11-03:/blog/komodo-35-for-os-x-is-out-now</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've been asking for it for about 2 years now but ActiveState has finally come out with an OS X native version of the Komodo IDE.

Is it too late?  I dunno... I've been using Zend Studio for a while now and I've come to really like it.  The latest version with the code folding is &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; nice (well, other features as well, of course).  So I've got the ability to use the OS X version of Komodo now due to my licenses for the Windows/Linux version.  I played with the beta a bit, but didn't have much time to really get into it... seemed ok tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I use it as a PHP IDE, which is what I originally got it for?  I'm not sure...  Zend Studio does pretty good there.  I'll have to fiddle with it and see which I like better.  Komodo also does Perl, Tcl, Python, and now Ruby too, so it's a more overall IDE than Zend Studio.  Cool, but I'm primarily a PHP coder so it doesn't matter so much to me... =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell I guess.  I'll do some work with it and see how I like.  I haven't much done anything with Komodo since I moved my desktops to either OS X or Mandriva/x86_64 and since Komodo was a 32bit app, with no 64bit version, it caused me nothing but grief on Mandriva/x86_64 (which is why I went to Zend).  I would have been more than happy to work with Komodo on my laptop if it worked.  I'll make some notes as to which I like better once I've had more of a chance to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;

People actually feel justified by trying to run people over (with a stinking car no less!), crushing old men underfoot, and pushing over &lt;i&gt;baby&lt;/i&gt; strollers, all for some stinking iBooks?!?  What in God's name has this world come to?!?  One of the links in the article points to this &lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/16/50-ibooks-cause-stampede/"&gt;entry on The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt; and reading that got my blood boiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This other story on &lt;a href="http://www.wwbt.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WWBT/MGArticle/WBT_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1031784465955"&gt;NBC12 Online&lt;/a&gt; gives some more details and they're astounding.  For one, the organizers should be shot.  1000 ibooks for $50 and only 5 cops for crowd control?  I'm amazed the cops weren't trampelled (although they did bring in another 70 cops (20 in riot gear) and 22 firemen).  &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/08/16/computer.frenzy.ap/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; has more details.  These are a few choice quotes that amaze me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;...one woman standing in front of her was so desperate to retain her place in line that she urinated on herself.&lt;/i&gt;"  WTF?!?  Are you kidding me?  She pissed herself for an &lt;i&gt;iBook&lt;/i&gt;?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this one is the worst, and I swear, if I was an organizer and heard this fellow saying this, I'd refuse to sell him the gum on the bottom of my shoes because this is the worst kind of attitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Jesse Sandler said he was one of the people pushing forward, using a folding chair he had brought with him to beat back people who tried to cut in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I took my chair here and I threw it over my shoulder and I went, 'Bam,"' the 20-year-old said nonchalantly, his eyes glued to the screen of his new iBook, as he tapped away on the keyboard at a testing station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They were getting in front of me and I was there a lot earlier than them, so I thought that it was just," he said.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're kidding me, right?  What has this world come to?!?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Tiger's Mail.app stinks</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/tigers-mailapp-stinks" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-07-30T21:40:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-07-30T21:40:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-07-30:/blog/tigers-mailapp-stinks</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else had issues with Tiger's Mail.app?

I preferred the version that came with Panther!  After using it for a while, and doing a fresh install about two days ago (granted, I copied all of the old files, but still... the whole system feels spunkier so one would assume that Mail would speed up a bit as well), it's dragging like there's no tomorrow.  I get more mail than the average person...  I get over 13000 emails in a month and that doubles because I have every email copied into an archive folder (so if I need to find something a few months down the road, I can).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the big problem here is Tiger's Mail uses individual files for emails which is absolutely retarded.  What was wrong with the mbox format?  Absolutely nothing.  Server-side, I prefer using Maildir to store email... it's much more efficient and safer, but for a client, I've been using mbox since forever.  This slowness is almost making me want to switch back to mutt for crying out loud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many people, I have some very strict requirements when it comes to email and that's only because I use it all the time and because I get so bloody much of it.  The absolute first thing it needs is GPG support because I sign every single piece of email I send out.  That rules out a whole lot of Mac-based email clients.  For two, I need a good way of sorting messages and while Mail.app is passable, it's not at all what I would like (regexp anyone?)... but I make do.  For three, I'm really loving SpamSieve... I think that is the best dang piece of spam-killing software around.  I absolutely love it.  My email client should ideally make use of it.  Finally, because I use DayLite for contact management, any mail client I use should be able to use AddressBook as a... well... address book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leaves me in a quandry.  Only Mail.app does all of these things (with the exception of regexp-based rules... boolean rules are ok I suppose).  I'd really like to give Thunderbird a go, but it doesn't support SpamSieve, and I really don't feel like re-training the spam handler it comes with.  It's got the other bases covered, except I don't think it supports AB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to use mutt, and I'm very much tempted to go back to it.  The only thing I'll lose is SpamSieve, which will be sorely missed, but I suppose I could use SpamAssassin in it's place.  I did have mutt capable of using AddressBook in the past, I can probably do so again (although I've since misplaced my ~/.mutt config files... grrr...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the other Mac email clients pretty much suck.  I wouldn't mind MailSmith, but the bone heads at BareBones insist that you should use PGP and provide no support for GPG... I guess if they figure someone's gonna spend 3x more than what it reasonable for an email client, they'll buy PGP to boot.  I'm aware that there is a free version which would be sufficient, but the last time I tried to convert my GPG key to a PGP key (just for kicks) I came up with a whole lot of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don't get is what Mail.app sucks so bad now.  Maybe using Smart Mailboxes isn't so smart... or maybe it's Spotlight slowing things down.  I'm guessing it's my high number of emails and each one being an individual file.  I don't get it.  This new version seems like a major regression and this is probably the only thing I dislike about Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't be the only person using a Mac who deals with high volume of email.  What do other folks use that have a large number of mails they need to deal with?  I don't mind paying for a solution that works... in fact, if it does everything I need, I'd gladly fork the money over.  Heck, if Mailsmith did everything I needed, I'd pay for a license despite how ridiculous the price is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I'll try a few things like disabling Smart Mailboxes in Mail.app and see if that makes a difference, but I really shouldn't have to disable one of the funky new features in an app in order to make it perform as well as the old version, should I?  For the record, Panther's Mail.app with it's mbox files performed admirably; I never had a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and before someone thinks that this is a processor or RAM issue, I'm running this on a dual 1.8GHz G5 with 2.5GB of RAM... the processor or RAM is definitely &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Essential Applications</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/essential-applications" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-07-01T15:07:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-07-01T15:07:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-07-01:/blog/essential-applications</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think everyone has a set of applications that are absolutely essential to them.

I'd like to list a few of the essentials and favourite apps that I use for OS X (I'll do another list later for Linux).  There are a lot of great applications out there... some open source and/or free, some shareware, and some commercial.  I think each have their place and unlike some people, I don't necessarily go for the open source and/or free ones first.  I go for what fits my needs and if it works as I need, I'll pay for it.  If I can find something just as good (or better) open source, then I'll obviously take that first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, let's get on with the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to break the list down by application/usage type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Development Tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By development tools I mean things like IDE's, text editors, etc.  Most of my development is in PHP (web design, web apps), with a little bit of perl, shell scripting, and applescript (sorta, still learning it) thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.zend.com/store/products/zend-studio/"&gt;Zend Studio&lt;/a&gt; - an excellent PHP IDE written in Java.  Although I prefer ActiveStates's &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/"&gt;Komodo&lt;/a&gt;, there isn't an OS X-native version (yet).
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml"&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt; - an excellent text editor with syntax highlighting, awesome regexp support, and lots lots more.  A little expensive, but if you like the features it has, well worth it.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://yoursql.ludit.it/"&gt;YourSQL&lt;/a&gt; - a good tool to create and manipulate SQL databases (open source).
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/administrator/1.0.html"&gt;MySQL Administrator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_new" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/query-browser/1.1.html"&gt;MySQL Query Browser&lt;/a&gt; from the MySQL developers.  These are new(ish) tools (at least on OS X) but they work great for administering MySQL databases
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Browsers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web browsers.  Love 'em or hate 'em.  Here's a few I like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Safari - of course.  In Tiger it's much better, although I don't like the RSS support, but that's just me.  It's my normal every-day browser
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; - great browser.  The only browser I use under Windows, I don't really care for the "feel" of it under OS X.  Having said that, the web developer tools plugin is second to none and that in itself makes Firefox essential for debugging websites.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/"&gt;OmniWeb&lt;/a&gt; - I have a love/hate relationship with this browser... it uses the same engine as Safari and has some great features (per-site preferences, screenshot tabs, and some other cool features)... unfortunately, it's kinda crashy under Tiger right now and it doesn't seem like the authors are in a hurry to update it... sometimes it makes me regret that I put out money for it, but oh well
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video and Audio&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do all of my audio with iTunes.  It does absolutely everything I need.  For video, I primarily use QuickTime to view what it can, but I've found it doesn't view everything.  I try to avoid Windows Media Player unless I absolutely have to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"&gt;VLC&lt;/a&gt; - this is one wicked media player.  I found some mpeg video files that wouldn't play in WMP for OS X or in QuickTime; they'd only run in WMP on Windows and in some other third-party video viewer on Windows.  They played perfectly in VLC.  This is a recent addition to my must-haves, but after that, it's definitely one to check out.  It's also open source and free.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.lairware.com/mpfreaker/"&gt;MPFreaker&lt;/a&gt; - a program that inserts artwork  and updates MP3 ID tags... it's not free, but I really like this software as it makes managing my iTunes library a little bit easier... I know there are some freebie programs that are probably just as good or better, but I've been using this one for a while and really like it
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interface Customization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from a Linux background where I can switch from GNOME to KDE to Englightenment and skin them any which way I want, the look of my desktop is important to me.. if for nothing else than to relieve some boredom since I look at it all day long.  To that end, there are a few apps that help me manage because I think I'd go stir crazy or switch back to a fulltime Linux desktop if I had to stare at an unmodified Aqua all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/shapeshifter/"&gt;ShapeShifter&lt;/a&gt; - from the fine folks at Unsanity, this lets me change the look of the OS with themes
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.iconfactory.com/cb_home.asp"&gt;CandyBar&lt;/a&gt; - an easy-to-use and fast way to change icons for your desktop
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/"&gt;LaunchBar&lt;/a&gt; - not really something to change the look of the desktop, but with a two-key combo, I can launch any application on the system, folder, music file, etc.  Some people think that Spotlight makes LaunchBar obsolete, but I disagree.  Spotlight is a great search tool, but LaunchBar beats launching an app from the Finder and is faster than Spotlight in returning what you want... an OS X desktop feels naked without it
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/"&gt;Desktop Manager&lt;/a&gt; - this gives you virtual desktops and while from the site it sounds like it may not work too well, I've had no problems with it at all.  Again, coming from a Linux background where I routinely have at least four active virtual desktops, each with something on it, Desktop Manger is a life saver and it feels wierd when I don't have virtual desktops anymore.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.cocoatech.com/pf.php"&gt;PathFinder&lt;/a&gt; - not quite as essential as I had once thought since the Finder's had a bit of an overhaul in Tiger, this is still a good Finder replacement.  I don't use it as a Finder replacement, but I do use it instead of the Finder a lot of the time as it can be customized some more and has some great "power user" features.  Hasn't been updated in a bit, but I'm looking forward to seeing what the next version will do
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://weatherdock.alwintroost.nl/"&gt;WeatherDock&lt;/a&gt; - I used to be a WeatherPop Advance user until I found this.  Not only is it more accurate, it's also much nicer looking with a desktop overlay and menu bar status... and just as importantly, it's free
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Networking Tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From browsers to RSS readers to IRC clients... these are what I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://xchataqua.sourceforge.net/"&gt;X-Chat Aqua&lt;/a&gt; - an extremely well done port of the X-Chat IRC client to use the Aqua interface.  X-Chat is all I use on Linux and I've tried a few other IRC clients for OS X and they all stink.  X-Chat Aqua is the best of the bunch, it's free, and very reliable... I live in IRC so I need something good
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/"&gt;NetNewsWire Lite&lt;/a&gt; - I don't have a problem with paying for software, but the Lite version of this good RSS reader works well enough for me and I don't need the advanced features.  For a while I was using NewsFire, but since it hit 1.0 and the author essentially said "thanks for the free beta testing, now I'm charging", I've gone back to NetNewsWire Lite.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.panic.com/unison/"&gt;Unison&lt;a/&gt; - a good NNTP client.  I've yet to find anything that comes close to Unison for news reading on OS X... this one works very well
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/"&gt;Transmit&lt;/a&gt; - version 3 of this FTP client is a much needed refresh and it's a pretty decent FTP client now.  I've also looked at &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.yummysoftware.com/"&gt;Yummy FTP&lt;/a&gt; and this looks like a really good FTP client too.  Both are shareware, and since I'd already paid for Transmit, I haven't bothered to look at Yummy much more than just to check it out... has some exceptionally nice features and in many respects is better than Transmit, but I don't use FTP enough to shell out for another program (I typically use scp or rsync for most file transfers).  The odd time I do need to use FTP I'm either using ncftp (installed via Fink) or Transmit
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.sshkeychain.org/"&gt;SSHKeyChain&lt;/a&gt; - a nice GU frontend to managing SSH keys.  Absolutely essential for me since I can use my ssh keys now from within any terminal, BBEdit, and so on
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.adiumx.com/"&gt;AdiumX&lt;/a&gt; - an excellent open source multi-protocol instant messaging client.  I use it for the odd MSN and Jabber needs, although i use iChat for my day-to-day IM.  AdiumX is an extremely well done client, my only beef is it's based in Gaim which I think is utter crap software due to the high number of security holes that have been found in it in the last year alone
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://c-command.com/spamsieve/"&gt;SpamSieve&lt;/a&gt; - I use Apple Mail and it's junk filters are ok, but nothing great... SpamSieve is an awesome spam filter.  Makes using Mail so much nicer considering the high volume of spam I get.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.sente.ch/software/GPGMail/English.lproj/GPGMail.html"&gt;GPGMail&lt;/a&gt; - a plugin for Mail to allow for the use of GPG encryption, signing, etc. (absolutely essential for me since I sign everything I send out)
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Productivity Tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By productivity I mean things like CRM, PIM, project management, word processing, etc.  There's a lot of stuff out there, and a lot of it is awful.  Some is pretty good and I'm sure I haven't found all of the good stuff, but this is what I use and like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.marketcircle.com/daylite/index.html"&gt;DayLite&lt;/a&gt; - the best CRM (Contact Relationship Manager) I've seen for OS X.  Unlike the other tools for OS X, this one has &lt;i&gt;power&lt;/i&gt;.  It uses an SQL database for the backend which allows me to share my info between the desktop and laptop machines without any silly synchronization schemes.  Hooks well with Address Book, and moderately ok with iCal (the 2.0 promises to have better integration).  Extremely useful software although it's a bit pricey at first glance... the features make the cost well worth it (but only if you have a need for the features that can't be found in other CRM or PIM apps; for anyone who wants to share data in an organization, DayLite is a must-have)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.projectwizards.net/en/merlin"&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; - a project management app that allows for different views (Network, Gantt), budgets, resource assignments, file attachments, and more.  A very useful app that goes a long way in helping me plan my week
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.php"&gt;DevonThink&lt;/a&gt; - an excellent all-purpose tool... great for taking notes, keeping copies of websites, organizing PDF's (and making them text searchable).  DevonThink is really useful for organizing text.  I use it to keep electronic books and magazines, hints from macosxhints.com, weekly reports for work, system logs, etc.  With the quick search engine it makes finding stuff a snap.  The new PRO version promises to be a worthwhile upgrade, but a while ago they promised it would be a multi-client app, but I don't think the first PRO version will have these capabilities, which is a shame.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php"&gt;NeoOffice/J&lt;/a&gt; - a port of OpenOffice.org for OS X.  I've used OOo on OS X under X11, and let me tell you, NeoOffice/J is &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; nicer.  Normally I use a text editor like BBEdit (or joe/vim in the terminal) for working with text, and I do have a copy of Microsoft Office which I use the rest of the time, but I often get files in OOo format, and using NeoOffice/J is much more convenient (and prettier!) than using OOo under X11.  It's also GPL and free, so the price is perfect.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Miscellaneous Needed Apps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other stuff that I use/need that doesn't necessarily fall into the above categories and I just don't feel like breaking out into a bunch of new categories... =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Fink&lt;/a&gt; - a package management system and ported "Linux" apps for OS X.  They're not really Linux apps, but they're bundled open source applications to make for easy install on OS X.  This is one of the first things I install on OS X... Fink is an absolute must have (easy access to apps like ncftp, joe, vim, nmap, ethereal, and a whole whackload more... you can even install KDE via Fink!)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html"&gt;SuperDuper!&lt;/a&gt; - the absolute best backup software for OS X I've ever laid eyes on.  Like Carbon Copy Cloner, but so much better.  I use this to create disk image backups of my drives.. these are true 100% perfect replicas of the original drive and have saved my butt a few times
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool.html"&gt;TinkerTool&lt;a/&gt; and &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerToolSys.html"&gt;TinkerTool System&lt;/a&gt; - TinkerTool is for personal settings and allows you to tweak all kinds of things; TinkerTool System is for system-wide tinkering.  TinkerTool is free, TinkerTool System costs a few dollars (not much, only 7 euros) and is well worth it with all the things you can do with it
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.jimmitchelldesigns.com/yasu.html"&gt;Yasu&lt;/a&gt; - Yet Another System Utility; not a bad little tool.  TinkerTool System and TinkerTool together do everything Yasu does and way more, but Yasu is a good tool if you don't need all the power of TT and TTS.  Great for cleaning caches, running the periodic maintenance scripts, etc.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/"&gt;GeekTool&lt;/a&gt; - this is an awesome tool that lets you put the output of commandline commands right on the desktop.  It also does the same foor images and system logs.  The author says it's not fully compliant with Tiger and doesn't have any plans for a short term release, so use it at your own risk.  Having said that, it works wonderfully for me and I use it to view various logs that are "sticky" on the background... a great way to have logs displayed in near real-time without having a separate terminal open to tail them
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/"&gt;MenuMeters&lt;/a&gt; - displays CPU usage, network throughput, memory usage, and other stuff in your menu bar.. very handy
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's my list.  I'm sure there are heaps of great software out there that I've never even checked out before, but for what I need to do, these are the apps I am most often using and would have a hard time doing without.  There's probably a few that I've missed, but these are the ones I can think of right now.... regular apps are easy enough to see/remember, but it's the little things that are preference panes, etc. that are sometimes easy to miss.  If I think of more, or find some new stuff, I'll be sure to update this entry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>This whole "MacTel" thing is getting old...</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/this-whole-mactel-thing-is-getting-old" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-06-20T20:01:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-06-20T20:01:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-06-20:/blog/this-whole-mactel-thing-is-getting-old</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hate to add to the noise that's going on about Apple's move from PPC to x86, but it's just starting to irritate me so much.

I can't believe that people are so stupid and/or blind!  The death of Linux?  Come on.  Microsoft might like us to believe that, but it's just more FUD.  Will Apple steal marketshare from Linux now that OS X will run on x86?  Puhlease.  Only an idiot would think so.  Want to know why?  Because Linux on the desktop doesn't have that much marketshare to steal!  And OS X for servers?  Come on, that's only for the clueless who need Apple's (albeit very very nice) hand-holding administration software (yes, the Linux crowd could do well to emulate some of the tools found in OS X Server).  Anyone who has read any performance benchmarks on any apps requiring threading is likely to run screaming in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where will Apple be stealing marketshare from?  Well, the obvious answer is Windows.  I don't think it'll steal marketshare from Linux because a) there isn't a lot there to begin with (IIRC, I read somewhere not to long ago that Linux is estimated to have 6% of the desktop market), and b) the people who use Linux on the desktop have chosen to for a reason and likely won't be swayed over to OS X.  They &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be moved from their Dell PC to an Apple desktop machine, sure, but unless Apple lowers it's prices some, I doubt that unless it's for the geeks who like shiny toys, not the zealous who prefer free beer &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; free speach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "MacTel" (what a stupid name) will be a nice system, absolutely.  Apple has refinements to their hardware that makes other PC makers drool.  I saw in a London Drugs flyer not too long ago Sony's attempt at an iMac-like system which essentially looked like a goofy LCD screen slapped onto a sideways-slanting compaq desktop (you know the old thin(ish) ones meant to sit on the desk).  It looked absolutely ridiculous.  It amazes me that Apple can come up with this stuff and the people who try to emulate it do such a crappy job.  I mean, Apple has some really smart folks there doing their hardware design, but I can't believe that the people who have the same job at Sony can dish out cobbled-together looking junk and think it's good enough to sell, much less compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, wandering...  Oh yeah.  The beautiful thing about the new x86 mac machines is that you'll be able to triple boot OS X, Windows, and Linux.  I don't blame Apple for locking OS X to their hardware... they are a hardware manufacturer after all.  Moving to the x86 platform is almost guaranteed to double their hardware sales at a &lt;i&gt;minimum&lt;/i&gt;.  I know too many people who have drooled over mac hardware but were put off because of the "bubblegum" look of OS X, or they just didn't like OS X as an OS.  And that's fine.  But now these people can buy the mac hardware they've dreamed of and still run their favourite OS, no matter &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; it is... could be Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, heck even BeOS.  The choice is limitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conjecture about Apple restricting their machines from booting Windows is equally silly.  Do people not realize that by making an "open" (sorta) system that will boot Windows, they'll sell tonnes more hardware?  Absolutely OS X is a killer desktop system, but that doesn't change the fact that sometimes I need to boot into Windows to get my EQ fix, or that someone has spent a few thousand dollars in software required for work or play that just would be too costly to re-purchase as an OS X-native app, &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; that's even an option.  But now these people can continue to run Windows, but run it on a mac.  How cool is that?  And how many more sales is that going to put under Apple's belt since that will be a viable (if unsupported) option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the last straw was reading this opinion piece here: &lt;a href="http://www.xyzcomputing.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=366&amp;Itemid=26&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=0"&gt;MacTel: A Disaster for Linux?&lt;/a&gt;.  The guy has a few decent points, but he still doesn't get it.  I think the problem is that too many journalists just don't understand Linux, or the whole OSS movement.  He disagrees with the fact that people will stop developing OSS for Linux and instead develop it for OS X, to some extent, but he by and large doesn't seem to get the fact that stuff is rarely developed "for Linux".  The things that make Linux popular weren't written "for Linux".  The OSS developers out there don't develop "for Linux".  There aren't any Linux developers to steal because they weren't there in the first place!  The only "Linux developers" are the folks working on the kernel and those developers of proprietary software specifically targetted at Linux (and even then, many of those apps are cross-platform).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Linux developers that people are afraid Apple is going to steal don't exist, so there's nothing to steal.  Was Apache written for Linux?  Nope.  Samba?  Nope.  KDE?  Not really.  All of these programs run on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, they even already run on OS X!  So what is all this worry?  That people are going to stop writing QT or GTK apps because they can write for Aqua now?  I have news for people... Apple's X11 exists, works quite well, and projects like Fink provide a large number of desktop packages written "for Linux" in the OS X environment.  Yes, sometimes there is a challenge writing code portable enough to run on x86, x86_64, PPC, PPC64... but this is nothing new... this has been happening with Sparc, Alpha, and many other platforms long before OS X came around.  Most OSS software is already cross-platform... more often than not, a few tweaks and a recompile and it's running on a different platform than what the author wrote it for.  And PPC isn't going to be forgotten by any Linux developers.  Remember who's sinking millions into Linux?  Yup, the same guys selling the POWER chips.  That's all PPC as well.  You think IBM is going to stop selling POWER-based systems now that Apple isn't using their CPUs?  Get a grip.  Yellowdog is still committed to the PPC platform.  Linux on PPC/POWER is viable and has support.  It isn't going away.  Anyone know about the Linux for XBOX projects?  Yup, it will probably carry on with the XBOX 360 (that is such a &lt;i&gt;sweet&lt;/i&gt; target to hack!), and it's also PPC-based.  Linux for PPC is going absolutely &lt;i&gt;nowhere&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't get it.  All this conjecture, all this really silly speculation, and it boils down to a few essential things.  Will Apple steal marketshare now that it's going to be running on x86 software?  Absolutely.  But it'll be people fed up with Windows and viruses and spyware and adware and all the other junk that makes Windows an absolute hell to use.  It's not going to be people who already use a Linux desktop that is free from all of these problems and that provides literally thousands of applications.  These apps can't be taken away from us, and if a developer stops working on it, someone else can pick it up.  And you know what?  They won't be stopping working on it because they all of a sudden have an urge to write an Aqua app because they bought a new "MacTel" because the first thing they will do is modify their program to work on OS X &lt;i&gt;in addition to the other OS's and platforms it already supports&lt;/i&gt;.  Do I see more OS X native software to work in conjunction with these apps?  Sure.  More Aqua frontends?  Absolutely.  But they won't replace what's already there, and it won't stifle new innovation and programs.  Projects like KDE aren't just going to up and die because people are using macs now.  With Fink, they can still develop KDE and use it &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; Aqua.  It can be done... I've done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all just so irritating...  we have no idea what will happen, but every day someone comes out with a new idea or thought that is just as ludicrous as yesterday's brain fart of the day.  People just don't get it and it's almost enough to make you scream!  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I just think it's going to rock that I can have one powerbook to carry around running XP, Mandriva, Annvix (for testing), and OS X rather than carrying around both my current powerbook and my compaq x86_64 laptop.  I'm all for this move and can't wait for some faster, more powerful, and most importantly 64bit laptops to roll out of Cuppertino.  I use what I use when I need it and where I need it, and in some cases Linux does a better job, in most (for me, for my desktop) OS X does a better job, and in one case (EQ) Windows does it best.  It's called the right tool for the right job and I love that in two years I will have so much flexibility I won't know what do with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're going to have to start coming out with some much larger-sized laptop hard drives.  &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is what people should be worrying about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the one seriously huge plus about OS X running on x86?  VMware.  None of this VirtualPC slow-as-slugs stuff.  I am dying for the day to get an OS X-native VMware that I can fire up my two dozen virtual machines (Linux, *BSD, Windows) and work with it on a mac.  It gives me shivers just thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention we're going to need much larger-sized laptop drives?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>OS X 10.4 "Tiger" thoughts</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/os-x-104-tiger-thoughts" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-05-08T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-05-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-05-08:/blog/os-x-104-tiger-thoughts</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I got OS X 10.4 (aka "Tiger") the night it came out.. then spent that night doing backups before I even opened the box.

Took me a bit, but worth it because I always do an erase and install... best time to clean up is when installing a new OS. Unfortunately, come Saturday morning, things didn't look so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing is the DVD verification failed at about 65% on my emac. Tried it three times and no dice; even skipped the verification (on the advice of the geniuses from where I bought it) and it failed during the install. Weird thing is it failed in the same place on my G5, but verified fine on my powerbook. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, brought it back, got a new one, and I was good to go. This one went ok, installed on the emac first... looked good. Installed on the G5 next.. what a mess. Let me tell you... having about 1.5TB of storage and Spotlight indexing right from the get-go is not a good thing. Took about 24hrs to do the indexing and even that was cleaning up a bunch of redundant files (I keep rsync backups of all my servers on a big 500GB drive so it's a lot of little files). Then I also told Spotlight to treat that drive as private. Not really private, but doesn't need to be indexed. Once I did that, things started moving smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other rough spots with some apps, noteably with PocketMac Pro which, when I disconnected my iPaq, caused a kernel panic. Apparently they will have a Tiger-certified version out within the first half of this month. Everything else seems to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I've been using Tiger for a few days, how do I find it? Well, I like it. I can't say yet that I like it much better than Panther, but it does feel faster (maybe due to the erase/install, I'm not sure). It seems quite a bit faster on my G5, and feels faster on the powerbook as well. Dashboard hasn't really done anything for me yet. I think the calculator is next to useless (which is the "big" thing for me as far as the stock widgets go)... when you try to divide something, it gives an error. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotlight is pretty cool, and I thought maybe it would replace Launchbar (which I love) as an app launcher. No way. For one, Spotlight returns too many results, and it's slower than Launchbar. So I'm glad I bought Launchbar a while back, even though everyone said Spotlight would do the same thing. It does, but not as efficiently. For me, Spotlight is killer to find stuff nested inside documents and files. That's the thing I like about it. Great search tool (although from the Finder it's a little wonky sometimes... if I do a search for something, sometimes I'll get no results until I capitalize something, even though there are no caps in the filename... go figure). Not sure if the search bit in the Finder is using Spotlight tho. Might not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I'm keen on trying is Automator... but I haven't played with it yet. Sounds like it could be a fantastic time-saver, unfortunately I don't have the time to figure it out. Oh well... maybe in the next few weeks when I finish a few projects. Then I'll be able to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I like Tiger. I do have to admit that Apple would do well to have more than one theme for the OS. Thank God for Unsanity's ShapeShifter... I need some variation and style and I honestly prefer the look of Panther to the look of Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know.. I know of at least one person personally who's had to roll back a machine to Panther. Sucks to be him I guess. I've read some reports from people who have Tiger but don't really think much of some of the new features. I like them all, except Dashboard, but I think it may become more useful once there are more third-party widgets (and once the calculator gets fixed). For the other stuff in Dashboard, that's what I have WeatherDock and wClock for. I don't really have a need for Dashboard.. maybe the stock ticker once I do some more investing on my own, but that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I like Tiger. Reading the features on Tiger Server really had me tickled... and irked that I don't have it (or an Xserve to run it on). Some very cool features in there. Would I use OS X server over Annvix? I doubt it. For one, the eye candy that is Aqua has to take a hit on performance that Annvix never will, and let's face it... although the cost of an Xserve is reasonable to other machines in that class it can't beat something like Annvix that I can happily run on an 800MHz duron... who can't get one of those for the fraction of the cost of an Xserve? Sure it may not be as cool looking or as fast, but it can definitely get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entry for another day, perhaps. I'll never really know until I get to play with one, but that likely won't ever happen... I can't justify ponying up for that kind of hardware just to tinker... all my important stuff runs on Annvix and I can tweak that far easier and faster than I can OS X. But, as far as Tiger goes... so far I'm enjoying it. Now I just have to wait for my copy of Remote Desktop to show up so I can enjoy the spring/summer weather working outside...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Windows like OS X</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/windows-like-os-x" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-04-19T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-04-19T13:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-04-19:/blog/windows-like-os-x</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not really, OS X-related, but kinda is considering my Windows install looks more like a default OS X install than my Mac desktops do!

Read on for some good links to customizing Windows XP if you, like me, are saddled with using it some of the time and just can't stand how ugly the thing is out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange stuff, but I never thought I'd blog about Windows considering I can't stand it. However, it's become a necessary evil. For one, Quickbooks for Mac blows (especially the Canadian version), so I caved in and started using Quickbooks for Windows. Then I found Quicken for Mac was royally messing up my data, and reading about the latest version for Quicken for Mac (which, stupidly enough, isn't even available in Canada!) was no better, so I ditched Quicken for Mac to use Quicken for Windows after I couldn't find any good alternatives (online banking is a must).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, so I've got two important apps that I need Windows for (yes, I suppose I could use VMWare or Crossover Office or whatever, but I need things to be stable and I have a problem with upgrading Linux distros every 6mos (for work, I have to keep current) and reconfiguring stuff is a serious PITA. This is one reason I prefer OS X for my desktop machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, since I think Windows is hideously ugly, I like to mod it a bit. I had previously just used Stardock's excellent &lt;a href="http://www.windowblinds.net/"&gt;WindowBlinds&lt;/a&gt; program (shareware, but worth it in my opinion since it makes Windows look less Windows-ish). After using it for a while, I stumbled across this mod that makes Windows look very close to a default OS X setup... it's called &lt;a href="http://osx.portraitofakite.com/"&gt;FlyakiteOSX&lt;/a&gt; and if you haven't seen this you at least need to see this guy's website. It's amazing! Anyways, this mod makes my Windows machine look more like a Mac than my Mac does (I use Unsanity's excellent &lt;a href="http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/shapeshifter"&gt;ShapeShifter&lt;/a&gt; preference pane to "skin" OS X and I don't care what anyone says... Unsanity's stuff is very reliable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after monkeying around with that, which also installs Stardock's ObjectDock (which essentially looks like the OS X dock even with magnified icons on it.. very cool), I went looking for LiteStep which I used to use back in the Win98 days. It's a bit different now (I'm almost positive that it used to do virtual desktops), but seems fairly decent... I'll have to tweak it a bit to make it behave the way that I want it to. Since it didn't do virtual desktops, I ended up switching back to Explorer for the shell (LiteStep is a shell replacement that's not quite as bloated) and found Microsoft has a virtual desktop PowerToy available called &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx"&gt;Virtual Desktop Manager&lt;/a&gt; and it seems to work ok.. not nearly as smooth as anything on OS X or Linux, but it beats having a single desktop (can people actually work efficiently with only one desktop these days?!?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I just found all of this quite cool. I don't particularly care for Windows... about the only thing it's good for is EverQuest, Quicken, and QuickBooks (that's pretty much all I use it for). But the fact that I can make it look a lot less Windows-ish (read: butt-ugly), makes it a little better. Now if we could just do something about the stability of the whole thing... &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>LDAP Editor for OS X: Found!</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/ldap-editor-for-os-x-found" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-04-06T12:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-04-06T12:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-04-06:/blog/ldap-editor-for-os-x-found</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use LDAP for authentication on my LAN (I wrote one of the earliest and definitive articles available on the internet for MandrakeSecure quite a while back), but I find dealing with LDAP to be a serious PITA.

It's not the easiest thing to manage from the commandline... a GUI or web-based interface is almost required or you'll end up ripping off facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went hunting for an OS X-based client in order to manage the LDAP directory because my main desktop is an OS X machine. On the Linux side things are easy enough to find... A program called DirectoryAdministrator works remarkably well. Doing a search for "ldap" on versiontracker came up with about four entries... four! That's disgusting! The only one that seemed close to what I needed would only let you edit mail entries... I have a lot more in my LDAP database than an address book, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting on Google had me finding a program called &lt;a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~gawor/ldap/"&gt;LDAP Browser/Editor&lt;/a&gt; (written in Java tho). I'm not keen on Java to begin with, but Java apps seem to run at a decent speed on my machine... I use the Zend editor quite a bit and it's written in Java... no Aqua niceness, but whatever. Anyways, this program rocks. It allows me to edit, add, make templates from, etc. for my LDAP database. This is exactly the tool I needed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just felt like sharing in case anyone else is looking for the same kind of tool. I did notice in my Googling that OS X server seems to come with a nice looking tool called Workgroup Manager... why can't they put something like that in mainline OS X? Heck, I'd even pay a few bucks to have it as a separate app. I mean, really, how often will you log into the server in order to admin the database? The beauty of LDAP is that I can have the server tucked away and connect to it from my desktop machine and make changes to the directory without ever actually logging into the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, the article I saw mentioning Workgroup Manager is from the O'Reilly MacDevCenter entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/05/25/ldap.html"&gt;LDAP in Mac OS X Server &lt;/a&gt;". I don't really want to pony up for OS X Server to run that tool on my desktop, but dangit, those screen shots look pretty sharp.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>The OS X blog</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/the-os-x-blog" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-03-21T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-03-21T12:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-03-21:/blog/the-os-x-blog</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've never kept it a secret that I'm a huge fan of OS X.
