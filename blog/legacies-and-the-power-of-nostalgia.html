            <p>Legacies are a good thing.  Everyone wants to leave a legacy&#8230; in the most basic form it&#8217;s being a parent to a child who will carry on a physical legacy.  Almost everyone has a legacy, will have a legacy, or is someone else&#8217;s legacy.  There are, of course, other folks with bigger legacies&#8230; the guy who found Canada (no idea who he was, but I&#8217;m sure someone in Canada remembers him (or her)), the guy who found electricity (don&#8217;t know his name either&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty bad with history).. the first guy on the moon,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Well, tonight I was reminded of one of my legacies, and one I don&#8217;t think much of.  I&#8217;ve had a computer since I was a kid&#8230; my first machine as an <span class="caps">IBM</span> <span class="caps">PS</span>/2&#8230; a whopping 16MHz, <span class="caps">80MB</span> drive&#8230; yeah, some of you old timers had to deal with punch cards but you can&#8217;t steal the fact that I started off on a pretty tiny machine too (considering my daughter&#8217;s first machine was an iBook G3, I had it pretty rough).  Well, I got my first modem, got on my first <span class="caps">BBS</span>, and was hooked.  Within 6mos I had my own <span class="caps">BBS</span>.  Ask my wife sometime how much grief my BBSing gave her when we started dating (I&#8217;m sure her loathing of computers originated there&#8230; no, the loathing is <i>not</i> the legacy I&#8217;m talking about here, but it is&nbsp;one).</p>
<p>Well, back in 1996 I started a fidonet-style network called Sysop&#8217;s TechNet.  The point of the network was to discuss <span class="caps">BBS</span>&#8217;ing, to facilitate the expansion of new technologies being used in BBSing with the internet becoming more widely available and accessible, and the sticks in FidoNet were doing nothing but arguing.  Actually, quite a few good ideas came out of <span class="caps">STN</span> and I think some of the proposals and work we had done is still being used today, like the reconstruction of the nodelist to accomodate internet/telnet boards.  Anyways, I shut my board down in 2000 when I started working for (then)&nbsp;Mandrake.</p>
<p>Imagine my shock to realize that, even today, <span class="caps">STN</span> is still alive.  Maybe not thriving like it was in the old days (but no <span class="caps">BBS</span> is, either), but it&#8217;s still alive, still moderately active, and still very much alive.  Something I started almost 10 years ago still has <a href="http://www.sysoptech.net/stn-info.html">my name</a> attached to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Of course, this gets a guy thinking.  I logged into my first <span class="caps">BBS</span> today in probably 4 years.  And it felt good.  =)  I didn&#8217;t have any privileges to do much, but dangit&#8230; I was on a <span class="caps">BBS</span>.  It was old-school.  It felt damn good to be sitting there looking at <span class="caps">ANSI</span> art in all it&#8217;s hideous blocky glory.  I remember the old groups&#8230;  iCE, ACiD, and the others&#8230; man, those guys were amazing!  The things they could do with colored blocks (digital lego?) was&nbsp;insane.</p>
<p>So now this has me thinking.  And, unfortunately for me (once my wife finds out anyways), I&#8217;m actually thinking about setting up a <span class="caps">BBS</span> again.  Unlike my old friend Kevin who sparked this with an email today, I&#8217;m not gonna setup an <span class="caps">OS</span>/2 box to run the old software.  When I shut down my board, I was running <a href="http://www.bbbs.net/"><span class="caps">BBBS</span></a> which is perhaps the best <span class="caps">BBS</span> software out there and runs on <span class="caps">DOS</span>, <span class="caps">OS</span>/2, Windows, Linux (intel, <span class="caps">SPARC</span>, and alpha), and even FreeBSD.  For kicks a few months ago I dusted off my old backup <span class="caps">CD</span> and threw it on a Mandriva box to see if it still worked.  It&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m looking at this backup <span class="caps">CD</span> again and am seriously contemplating building this thing up from scratch again.  I did email the author of <span class="caps">BBBS</span> a few months ago to see if he&#8217;d release the source to <span class="caps">BBBS</span>&#8230; unfortunately, he said no.  Too bad.  I tried to encourage him to compile it for <span class="caps">OS</span> X&#8230; considering I haven&#8217;t heard from him, I suspect he hasn&#8217;t but maybe if I start running this sucker again he might.  I don&#8217;t need a cocoa interface for it&#8230; but I&#8217;d love to have <span class="caps">BTERM</span> (a special telnet/terminal emulator to connect to <span class="caps">BBBS</span> which has better enhancements than a traditional terminal program (or telnet)) run on <span class="caps">OS</span> X.  Then I wouldn&#8217;t have to ssh into a Linux box to use it (and there&#8217;s squat for good terminal programs for <span class="caps">OS</span> X, unfortunately, although I did manage to make xterm behave well&nbsp;enough).</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t just carry on from where I left off&#8230; back then I was using Mandrake 6.0 (or so), had a <span class="caps">SCSI</span> <span class="caps">CD</span>-<span class="caps">ROM</span>, a bunch of files available for download through the <span class="caps">CD</span> system since I didn&#8217;t have the space to store all the CDs, and a bunch of networks that may not even exist anymore.  Best thing to do would be to start from&nbsp;scratch.</p>
<p>Amusingly enough, I can still see my work on <span class="caps">BBBS</span> still lives on.  If you look at the <a href="http://www.bbbs.net/sysop.html#ABOUT_MANUAL">About this manual</a> section of the <span class="caps">BBBS</span> docs, you&#8217;ll see that, once again, I&#8217;m involved.  In fact, I wrote docs for a number of software including Nexus (another <span class="caps">BBS</span> package), and McMail (a frontend mailer).  I also beta tested <i>tonnes</i> of different software including <span class="caps">BBBS</span>, AllFix, WaterGate, McMail, Oblivion/2, T-Mail, Internet Rex&#8230; I know there&#8217;s more but those are the ones I can remember off the top of my&nbsp;head.</p>
<p>Will I get back into BBSing to the same extent?  Obviously not.  Things have changed, Mandriva keeps me busy, and &#8220;recreation&#8221; such as World of Warcraft, Annvix, Oblivion on <span class="caps">XBOX360</span>, and last, but totally not least, my wife and kid, make time spent on a <span class="caps">BBS</span> probably quite minimal.  But I feel like a guy who played with trains as a kid and then grows up and builds model trains as a hobby.  The nice thing about this hobby is it&#8217;s completely free now.  My <span class="caps">BBBS</span> license is paid.  My internet access is already paid.  I don&#8217;t have to pay long distance, I don&#8217;t have to get additional phone&nbsp;lines.</p>
<p>And, really, I don&#8217;t even care if anyone ever connects to it.  It&#8217;d be cool if some folks from back in the day did drop in to say hi, but I can live with being a sole user.  If nothing else, it gives me an outlet that is different from working on Linux, or doing <span class="caps">PHP</span> coding, or even playing games.  It&#8217;ll bring me back to my teenage years.  If nothing else, it&#8217;ll amuse me.  And the scripting language for <span class="caps">BBBS</span> (<span class="caps">BZ</span>) is awesome&#8230; it&#8217;ll be interesting to re-learn that stuff again.  Heck&#8230; I might even find some of my old <span class="caps">BZ</span> programs floating around.  =)  And maybe I&#8217;ll compile openrexx or whatever the <span class="caps">OSS</span> implementation of <span class="caps">REXX</span> is since <span class="caps">BBBS</span> can run <span class="caps">REXX</span> scripts&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230; the more I think about it, the more I think I&#8217;ll do it.  If it takes me a month to get it setup, who cares?  The fun will be in the journey, not the&nbsp;destination.</p>
<p>Nostalgia can be a pretty powerful thing, no?  If it wasn&#8217;t for nostalgia, I&#8217;d probably never do this.  But <i>something</i> made me hold onto that <span class="caps">CD</span> for the last 6&nbsp;years.</p>
