            <p>Ahhh&#8230; life in the wild frontier of the internet with it&#8217;s pervasive exploits, backdoors, rootkits, and other goodies.  It was quite a surprise this morning when I was reading through my daily logging reports and found that I had a process spring up since yesterday&#8217;s report telling me that a program named ./r0nin was newly listening to port 1666 on one of my web servers.  So aside went the mozilla testing to take a peek as this is a client webserver and, well, I don&#8217;t take kindly to tampering of any sort.  Besides, it&#8217;s been a while since I put my forensic skills to the&nbsp;test.</p>
<p>So let me give you the lowdown and if nothing else, it&#8217;ll serve as a reminder to me who, thankfully, has only had to do this once before (damn phpNuke!).  Now it&#8217;s damn a lazy client who decided running WordPress 1.3alpha2 was a good idea, especially considering all the xmlrpc noise that&#8217;s been made lately.  How&#8217;s that for a quick summary?  Read on for the&nbsp;goods.</p>
<p>The first notice was&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre>
Security Warning: There are modifications for port listening on your machine :
                -  Opened ports : tcp        0      0 *:1666                  *:*                     LISTEN      24465/r0nin
</pre>

<p>Well, that sure didn&#8217;t look good.  So I examined the other email reports (these are coming from rsec, the baby-brother of msec designed for Annvix).  The other reports didn&#8217;t bring to light anything of interest.  My tripwire report showed nothing had changed within the last 24hrs of the stuff I monitor (which doesn&#8217;t include the web roots, which I may change).  So at least no binaries had been tampered with, which is a good&nbsp;sign.</p>
<p>The next step was to find r0nin on that machine.  A quick <b>find / -name r0nin</b> found it in the web root of one of my client&#8217;s websites.  Now, this client runs a lot of different packages&#8230; geeklog, gallery, and wordpress; probably a few other things I didn&#8217;t immediately notice.  Anyways, in the webroot was r0nin, w00t, uselib24, and dc.txt.  The first three were executables, the last a perl script which identifies itself as &#8220;Data Cha0s Connect Back&nbsp;Backdoor&#8221;.</p>
<p>So now I know which site is at fault&#8230; I have the timestamps of the files indicating they were placed there or modified at 15:00, 15:06, 15:05, and 15:05 respectively (all on Sep 25).  Time to scrub some logfiles.  Doing some manual &#8220;surfing&#8221; of the logfiles showed me the following&nbsp;entries:</p>
<pre>
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:14:59:44 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 61 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:14:59:48 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 2696 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:14:59:56 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 110 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:15:00:20 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 13 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:15:00:25 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 1145 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:15:00:36 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 65 "-" "-"
</pre>

<p>Interesting.  WordPress has had a recent share of <span class="caps">XMLRPC</span> issues so this looked very suspicious, and it hit my timeframe.  Grepping in the wp/ directory showed me that the version was 1.3-alpha-2.  Looking at the website, 1.5.2 is out so I knew right there that the xmlrpc vulns were the&nbsp;culprit.</p>
<p>I decided to determine whether the executables were compiled on the system or whether they were just uploaded.  Unfortunately, with the xmlrpc server, nothing got logged so I had no idea what they did through it.  But doing some grepping and strings on the binary showed me they were not built with <span class="caps">SSP</span> protection, which indicated they were not compiled on my system.  Great&nbsp;news.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;ve determined they got to upload their backdoor files via WordPress&#8217; xmlrpc vulns.  The files are owned by apache, and a <b>ps axu</b> showed me that r0nin was running as user apache.  Didn&#8217;t look like they obtained root this way, so this was a bit of a bootstrap.  Obviously r0nin is some daemon to spawn a shell, probably as user apache, on the system.  Note to self: see if apache can happily run with a shell set to /bin/false rather than&nbsp;/bin/sh.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t too concerned when I saw r0nin listening on port 1666&#8230; showed me it wasn&#8217;t a priv port (good), and I also firewall the snot our of my servers&#8230; I have rules in place to limit inbound <i>and</i> outbound traffic; ie. that machine can&#8217;t even open an <span class="caps">FTP</span> connection to the outside world.  So I was pretty confident they wouldn&#8217;t get in that&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Grepping my kernel logfiles proved me&nbsp;right:</p>
<pre>
Sep 25 15:00:47 host kernel: Shorewall:net2all:DROP:IN=eth0 OUT= \
  MAC=00:50:ba:42:f7:0e:00:0d:bd:81:90:41:08:00 SRC=200.164.102.51 \
  DST=[my_ip] LEN=48 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=111 ID=5968 DF PROTO=TCP \
  SPT=1379 DPT=1666 WINDOW=64800 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 
</pre>

<p>(There were three attempts within a minute of each other&#8230; wrapped manually so as not to screw up the viewing&nbsp;output).</p>
<p>Same timeframe, same <span class="caps">IP</span> adress, and the destination port (<span class="caps">DPT</span>) was 1666, the port r0nin was listening to.  Thank you,&nbsp;Shorewall.</p>
<p>Since there was nothing else logged, and nothing else suspicious, I figure the script kiddy moved on after he realized he wasn&#8217;t getting in.  Poor boy.  After looking at all of this and determining that he didn&#8217;t get anywhere beyond the &#8220;bootstrap&#8221; phaze of the attack, I thought I&#8217;d take a look at w00t.  I assumed, just due to the name, that it was the exploit that would yield root.  Google didn&#8217;t really bring anything up, although I didn&#8217;t expect it would since &#8220;w00t&#8221; is such an elite term.  You know&#8230; 3r33t and /|ll that (yes, I used to run a hacker bbs and know all the&nbsp;lingo).</p>
<p>So I figured, what the hell, I&#8217;ll run it (as user apache, on a separate test machine, also running Annvix).  Yup.  It&#8217;s a rootkit.  Nice thing is, it didn&#8217;t work.  =)  strace doesn&#8217;t show anything particular; lots of segfaults.  It&#8217;s definitely trying to exploit the kernel, however, as it gives&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre>
[-] Unable to determine kernel address: Operation not supported
</pre>

<p>uselib24 looks interesting as&nbsp;well:</p>
<pre>
[vdanen@build ~]$ ./uselib24

[+] SLAB cleanup
    child 1 VMAs 401
    child 2 VMAs 23
    child 4 VMAs 03
[+] moved stack ffffc000, task_size=0x00000000, map_base=0xff800000
[+] vmalloc area 0x7d000000 - 0xf9f1b000

[-] FAILED: uselib (Function not implemented) 
Killed
</pre>

<p>I have no idea what any of that means, but I&#8217;m suspecting another kernel issue.  Oh well.  [<b><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</b> this kernel exploit is fairly old, the source can be found on <a href="http://packetstormsecurity.org/0501-exploits/uselib24.c">packetstorm</a>.]</p>
<p>Enough fun, time to clean this junk&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Bottom line?  Use a good fixed kernel (either a patched one from your vendor or the latest kernel.org kernel).  I&#8217;m not liking the 2.6 kernel for servers yet, so I&#8217;m using 2.4.31 with the openwall kernel patches.  Make sure your web apps are up to date; until the client fixes his wordpress install, I&#8217;ve set a apache deny clause to that directory so it can&#8217;t be used as an attack vector anymore.  And firewalls that not only prevent incoming traffic but also outgoing are a good thing.  Remember, default <span class="caps">DENY</span> and selectively <span class="caps">ACCEPT</span>.  To <span class="caps">DENY</span> particular ports is pointless, if I had done that, the intruder would have gotten in (I have no reason to explicitly firewall port 1666 after all).  But because I denied everything then opened selective ports (http, https, sshd, etc.) I got my butt&nbsp;covered.</p>
<p>Interesting stuff.  Hopefully it&#8217;ll be another 3 years before something like this happens again.  Of course, I&#8217;m going to have to keep on top of clients.  And tighten the hatches a bit more to make it even harder, but I think overall, this one went pretty good and no real damage was&nbsp;done.</p>
