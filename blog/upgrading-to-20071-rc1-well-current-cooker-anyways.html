            <p>I decided to give the new Mandriva 2007.1 RC1 a try.  Since I mirror cooker, I figured I'd do a straight "urpmi --auto-select" upgrade on my 2007 box rather than downloading a bunch of ISOs.  So it's not really RC1 (really, with a few hundred packages being changed since the RC was cut, I think calling it a beta might be better but whatever), but it's cooker current as of 10:00am my time (did a quick rsync to make sure I had the latest of everything).</p>
<p>I'm a GNOME user when I'm using Linux, so I was logged into GNOME when I fired up gnome-terminal, did a "urpmi.removemedia -a" then added the main/release and contribs/release media.</p>
<p>Overall the install went well.  930 packages, 1861MB, and 42 minutes later, the system was upgraded.  urpmi told me it was going to remove libpython2.4-devel (due to unsatisfied python == 2.4.3), didn't want to upgrade suspend-scripts due to missing wltool, and was going to remove libguile12 due to an unsatisfied guile == 1.6.8.  Fine, no worries although python could concern some people (don't worry, this is because python 2.5 is being installed, so you get libpython2.5).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the install failed at package 928 of 930 due to libiso9660_5 being missing (either not on the mirrors or has been replaced and the hdlists hadn't been upgraded).  No worries.  Doing another "urpmi --auto-select" afterwards installed another 4 packages... wierd... by my count there should have been 1 package left.</p>
<p>Now the wierdness begins.</p>
<p>Well, for one, 2007.0 updates have kernel 2.6.17.12mdv.  But 2007.1 only has 2.6.17.11mdv.  Huh?  Someone should fix that pretty quick.</p>
<p>The upgrade didn't install x11-driver-input-evdev, which was one of two errors preventing X from starting.  The second was a X version mismatch on the fglrx driver.  I believe I had installed the proprietary ATI drivers with ATI's package way back when.. been a while so I don't really remember.  Anyways, I added the non-free/release media and installed dkms-ati.  Still didn't work.  After using urpmf, I determined I needed to install the ati package as well (why this isn't a requirement of dkms-ati I have no idea).  Once that was done, X would start.</p>
<p>My hostname got removed.  My machine has the cool name of "cerberus"... imagine my dismay when it had the (ultimately boring) name of "localhost".  Ugh.  A trip to the Mandriva Control Center fixed that.</p>
<p>I suspect urpmi removed xscreensaver and didn't tell me.  Why?  Well, I had screensavers before, and I also had the screen lock after 10 minutes.  I had to urpmi xscreensaver.  Screensavers are back.  xlockmore is already installed.  Screen still doesn't lock.  When I tell GNOME to lock the screen it does a whole lot of nothing.  Doesn't even kick in the screensaver.  Too bad, because I wanted to watch Bob burn (Xflame).  And the "power management" button in the screensaver preferences does nothing.  I should have checked after I'd been away from the machine for a few hours whether or not the monitor got turned off.  Heck, the screensaver preview doesn't work either.  Something is broken here I think.</p>
<p>I haven't played too much more with it to poke around with other stuff.  vmware server works, so I'm happy... the rest doesn't much matter provided that a) zsh works, b) gnome-terminal works, and c) vmware-server works.  Beyond that, I don't much care (although a non-working screensaver is a little irritating... so is the fact that the session doesn't lock).</p>
<p>GNOME doesn't look any different.  I can't really determine quickly what's different about it.  KDE looks ok; I can tell it's changed.  Nothing overly exciting there, but KDE doesn't do it for me.</p>
<p>I tried to see if I could make Metisse work.  I got it enabled, then tried to log in with GNOME and it just sat there.  CTRL-ALT-BKSPACE'd out of that, tried KDE and now I have 9 virtual desktops.  Ok...  I can switch them, but I didn't see any of the fancy transitions that I noticed in the demos.  I suppose there's more to be done to configure it, but nothing in MCC or the menus jumped out at me as a "Metisse configuration tool".  Maybe there isn't one?</p>
<p>All in all, the upgrade went pretty smooth.  All things considered, I think this is the best verison upgrade I've done yet (normally I do a wipe and reinstall).  Everything, except the screensaver, came up just as good as before.  At quick glance, doesn't look like much has changed from a GUI perspective.  I haven't done much looking under the hood to see what else has changed...  I'll leave that for later tonight or tomorrow.</p>
