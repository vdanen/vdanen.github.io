            <p>I&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">GTD</span> (<a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a>)
as a methodology for how I work for a number of years.  I revisit the
systems I use occasionally, particularly when I don&#8217;t feel they&#8217;re working
out for me or my needs have changed.  And lately one of the biggest
challenge I have is that I&#8217;m actually quite good at <em>taking</em> notes, but I&#8217;m
not as good at <em>finding</em> the notes I&nbsp;took.</p>
<p>And as time goes on, I found I have more places to store things (documents
of various types, email, and so on) and while they can all be categorized
similarly, I never really bothered.  Previously I had focused on how to
organize things like OmniFocus (for tasks) versus organizing <em>everything</em>
in a similar way.  In other words, I would spend the time to organize a
system versus having a system to coherently organize all the data across
the systems I&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>As a point of reference, these are all the &#8220;storage buckets&#8221; I use for data
(whether for work or&nbsp;personal):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> for tracking&nbsp;tasks</li>
<li><a href="https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/">EagleFiler</a> for private
  out-of-the-cloud- document storage that I want to retain (think tax
  documents, receipts, PDFs,&nbsp;etc)</li>
<li>Mac&#8217;s Finder for things I download and presumably some might make it to
  EagleFiler (but I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m not very consistent&nbsp;here!)</li>
<li><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> for taking markdown notes (as a
  reference, I&#8217;ve gone through a number of systems here, including
  EagleFiler to store <span class="caps">RTF</span> notes,
  Joplin, Inkdrop, Quiver, and finally settling on Obsidian earlier this&nbsp;year)</li>
<li>Gmail for&nbsp;email</li>
<li>Google Drive for documents that are shared with others (family or
  co-workers) and other cloud&nbsp;storage</li>
<li>Apple Notes for quick, short-lived notes (such as the hotel room number I
  happen to be staying in or copy/paste references); I may rely on this
  less now that I can sync Obsidian to mobile&nbsp;devices</li>
</ul>
<p>And because this data can be used on the desktop system at home, or the
work laptop or personal laptop, in addition to my iPad and iPhone, these
systems as much as possible need to be sync&#8217;d.  Since I don&#8217;t trust cloud
services more than I need to, I try to sync as much of this via git as
possible and locally host my own <a href="https://about.gitea.com/">Gitea</a>
instance.  I store my EagleFiler storage and Obsidian data in git and use
it to synchronize across my&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll briefly describe how to sync Obsidian to iOS devices, which has its
own client, and then discuss a recent way I&#8217;ve found to categorize data
across disparate systems and&nbsp;applications.</p>
<h2 id="syncing-obsidian-to-ipad-andor-iphone">Syncing Obsidian to iPad and/or iPhone<a class="headerlink" href="#syncing-obsidian-to-ipad-andor-iphone" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>My ecosystem is entirely Apple-based, so I use Obsidian on my Mac and I use
both the iPhone and iPad, and it would be hugely beneficial to have the
data in Obsidian available to me on both&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>I followed <a href="https://meganesulli.com/blog/sync-obsidian-vault-iphone-ipad/">this tutorial on syncing Obsidian vaults to iPhone or iPad</a>
and it worked like a champ.  I use <a href="https://workingcopy.app/">Working Copy</a>
to get the git repository on my device and link it to the Obsidian vault,
meaning that I have access to notes and documents, at least those in
Obsidian, while on the go or I can use the iPad to take meeting notes
without obscuring a screen while having a meeting on Google Meet or Zoom or&nbsp;whatever.</p>
<p>The only downside is Working Copy has a cost if you want to use it with
Obsidian.  I don&#8217;t mind though; I&#8217;ve had a lot of situations where all I
had with me was my phone and I needed to reference something in my notes
which were not available.  From a productivity perspective, it&#8217;s a small
price to&nbsp;pay.</p>
<h2 id="categorization-using-johnny-decimal">Categorization using Johnny Decimal<a class="headerlink" href="#categorization-using-johnny-decimal" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>I randomly stumbled across a podcast, <a href="https://learnomnifocus.com/tutorial/2022-11-17-omnifocus-obsidian-workflows-with-leah-ferguson/">OmniFocus + Obsidian Workflows with Leah Ferguson</a>
discussing how to integrate OmniFocus with Obsidian.  I thought this would
be an interesting way to enhance my usage of both tools, since I already
use them both, perhaps with a bit of automation (I don&#8217;t use Apple
Shortcuts as much as I probably&nbsp;could).</p>
<p>The podcast was great, but not because of the Obsidian and OmniFocus
integration &#8212; while helpful, the introduction to <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/">Johnny Decimal</a>
was vastly more important and started me down a journey of trying to become
even more productive.  Making the data easier to find was what struck me
most when I was listening to Leah describe her use of those systems.  After
all, if I&#8217;m going to spend the time keeping something, what is it for if
not to easily find it when I need&nbsp;it?</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into all the specifics of how I organized things, but I&#8217;ll give
you some details to get the idea.  The essential premise is to start broad,
with no more than 10 categories, and then you narrow the aperture as you go
further.  For me, I made sure I only numbered three levels deep; anything
further than that just is un-numbered folders or files that I try to give
coherent names&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>At the top level I&nbsp;have:</p>
<ul>
<li>00&nbsp;Meta</li>
<li>10&nbsp;Personal</li>
<li>20&nbsp;Learning</li>
<li>30&nbsp;Professional</li>
<li>40&nbsp;Reference</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#8217;t found a need to have more than these high-level&nbsp;groups.</p>
<h3 id="00-meta">00 Meta<a class="headerlink" href="#00-meta" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p><code>00 Meta</code> is for all the random metadata that just needs a place to live.  In
Obsidian I&nbsp;have:</p>
<ul>
<li>00 Meta<ul>
<li>01&nbsp;Inbox</li>
<li>02&nbsp;Templates</li>
<li>03&nbsp;Resources</li>
<li>04 <span class="caps">SOP</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>04 SOP</code> is a special &#8220;Standard Operating Procedures&#8221; folder where I
document things like this system.  <code>01 Inbox</code> is the standard Obsidian
inbox for new files that haven&#8217;t been categorized.  <code>02 Templates</code> are for
the templates I use in Obsidian, such as the weekly template where I put
notes of my schedule for the week.  <code>03 Resources</code> are for all the
attachments (PDFs, graphics, etc) that are inserted into Obsidian&nbsp;documents.</p>
<p>In Gmail I use this a bit differently and have <code>00 Meta</code> as a label with
these nested&nbsp;sub-lables:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">ACTION</span></li>
<li><span class="caps">EVENTS</span></li>
<li><span class="caps">FOLLOWUP</span></li>
<li><span class="caps">IMPORTANT</span></li>
<li><span class="caps">WAITINGFOR</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ACTION</code> label should probably be used less as I work to get those
actions into OmniFocus.  This would be easier if
<a href="https://mimestream.com/">Mimestream</a> (my email client) had a way to expose
email links to itself rather than to the Gmail webUI, so right now it&#8217;s
just easier to label things than to manually copy the Gmail link and create
a new&nbsp;task.</p>
<p>The <code>00 Meta</code> category isn&#8217;t really used anywhere other than&nbsp;Obsidian.</p>
<h3 id="10-personal">10 Personal<a class="headerlink" href="#10-personal" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>This is for life stuff.  I don&#8217;t have a lot of sub-categories here (I
wonder if that&#8217;s worth exploring further!), but right now I&nbsp;have:</p>
<ul>
<li>11&nbsp;Christcity</li>
<li>12&nbsp;People</li>
<li>14&nbsp;Blog</li>
<li>15&nbsp;Health</li>
<li>19 Financial<ul>
<li>19.01&nbsp;Receipts</li>
<li>19.02&nbsp;Investing</li>
<li>19.03&nbsp;Compensation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might notice a few things here.  First, I don&#8217;t use all the numbers and
skip a few.  I&#8217;m trying to stay consistent across categories that have
overlap; for instance there are financial and people notes/documents/etc
for both Personal and Professional, so I try to keep that number&nbsp;consistent.</p>
<p>In this case I use <code>11 Christcity</code> for things related to church, whether it
be my duties as a District Pastor or marriage counsellor.  This label
exists in my personal Gmail as well.  <code>14 Blog</code> is where I can draft new
blog posts for this site (great thing that they both use markdown!), and
<code>19 Financial</code> has a few sub-categories such as <code>19.01 Receipts</code> where I&#8217;ll
keep receipts for purchases and  <code>19.02 Investing</code> where I keep
investment-related information.  These also have Gmail labels and folders
in&nbsp;EagleFiler.</p>
<p>The point here is that things that are relevant to a system should be
present there, things that aren&#8217;t relevant to a system should not.  For
example, if I wrote more on this blog and wanted to schedule things, I
might have <code>14 Blog</code> as a project in OmniFocus (I don&#8217;t, so I don&#8217;t).  I
might have church-related tasks to do so <code>11 Christcity</code> definitely shows
up in OmniFocus as well.  <code>15 Health</code> isn&#8217;t needed in Gmail, so I won&#8217;t
create a label for it, but I use it in EagleFiler for scans of health tests
and other documents, and in Obsidian for any notes I want to keep from a
doctor&#8217;s visit or&nbsp;similar.</p>
<p>I would recommend against creating all of these labels/folders for every
single system unless you need them, just to avoid&nbsp;clutter.</p>
<h3 id="20-learning">20 Learning<a class="headerlink" href="#20-learning" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>The <code>20 Learning</code> category is for stuff I have learned or that I want to
learn.  I use this on every system and have only two&nbsp;categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>21 Leadership<ul>
<li>21.03 Management&nbsp;Training</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>22 Technical&nbsp;Notes</li>
</ul>
<p>These are for notes I might take from a class or articles I&#8217;ve downloaded
that are specifically related to learning.  To be honest, I&#8217;m not yet sold
on <code>22 Technical Notes</code> as these feel more like they belong somewhere in
<code>40 Reference</code> but for now, I&#8217;m keeping it&nbsp;as-is.</p>
<p>I have other sub-categories under <code>21 Leadership</code> for some leadership
courses I take at work, where I collect observations, documents, and so&nbsp;forth.</p>
<h3 id="30-professional">30 Professional<a class="headerlink" href="#30-professional" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>This is the busiest category and requires a lot of attention to make sure
it stays orderly.  I take an insane amount of notes in meetings, and I have
a lot of meetings, which means I have a lot of documents.  I also have a
lot of work-related areas that require even more documents.  This section
has parts in all systems; again, not every single sub-category is needed in
every system, so not every system has them all.  The below is curated, but
should illustrate how I&#8217;m using&nbsp;it:</p>
<ul>
<li>31 Career<ul>
<li>31.01&nbsp;Mentoring</li>
<li>31.02&nbsp;Mentors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>32 People<ul>
<li>32.01&nbsp;Boss</li>
<li>32.02&nbsp;Peers</li>
<li>32.03&nbsp;Staff</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>33 Public<ul>
<li>33.01&nbsp;Papers</li>
<li>33.02&nbsp;Presentations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>34 Red Hat<ul>
<li>34.01 Weekly&nbsp;Notes</li>
<li>34.02&nbsp;Travel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>35 Product Security<ul>
<li>35.01&nbsp;Organization</li>
<li>35.09&nbsp;Escalations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>37 External<ul>
<li>37.01&nbsp;Customers</li>
<li>37.04&nbsp;Boards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>38&nbsp;Projects</li>
<li>39 Financial<ul>
<li>39.01 Receipts<ul>
<li>Travel<ul>
<li><em><span class="caps">YYYYMM</span> <span class="caps">DESTINATION</span></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea.  Effectively, I take meeting notes when I meet with
people, and those notes live under <code>32 People</code>.  For the people I meet with
sporadically, it&#8217;s a single file under their name.  For the people I meet
with often, their name is a folder, with a year-dated file for those notes
(so if &#8220;Bob Young&#8221; worked for me, I would have this year&#8217;s meeting notes
for him in <code>32 People/32.03 Staff/Bob Young/2023 Bob Young</code>.</p>
<p>For customers and partners, those notes are named after the company name.
For folks I mentor or am mentored by, they live in a file named after them
in <code>31 Careers/31.01 Mentoring</code>, etc.  I try to keep a <span class="caps">PDF</span> copy of
presentations I give in <code>33.02 Presentations</code> in EagleFiler and they&#8217;re
organized that way in Google Drive for the original presentation.  The
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-drive-is-investigating-sync-issues-as-users-complain-of-lost-files/">recent debacle</a>
of files being deleted from Google Drive reassures me that I&#8217;m not insane
for keeping a local&nbsp;copy.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the last few weeks since I started using this system, I&#8217;m
actually remembering the Johnny Decimal number which means it&#8217;s really easy
to find things.  I know that if I&#8217;m looking for information on Bob, I can
look for &#8220;32.03&#8221; almost anywhere and find him.  I might have work-related
documents about Bob in a folder living beneath <code>32.03 Staff</code> on Google
Drive, any tasks I&#8217;ve given to Bob and am waiting on would live in a
similarly named project in OmniFocus, emails from Bob automatically get
labeled <code>32.03 Staff/Bob Young</code> in Gmail.  This makes finding anything
related to Bob, or people in general, super easy to&nbsp;find.</p>
<p>For compliance purposes, I keep all the receipts that get emailed to me
(Uber, flights, etc.) so I arrange those by destination just to keep things
orderly.  So my last trip to Boston has receipts in <code>39 Financial/39.01
Receipts/Travel/202310 Boston</code>.</p>
<h3 id="40-reference">40 Reference<a class="headerlink" href="#40-reference" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>Finally, the <code>40 Reference</code> category is just a place for me to dump notes
or copies of interesting things that I may want to use or refer to at some
point in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<ul>
<li>41&nbsp;Books</li>
<li>42&nbsp;Online</li>
<li>43&nbsp;Papers</li>
<li>44&nbsp;Images</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#8217;t really gotten into sub-categories here yet because I&#8217;m still
sorting things out.  As I move things into these buckets, I&#8217;ll see if
common themes or topics occur that require further&nbsp;categorization.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>I started this journey about two weeks ago and it took quite a while,
slowly picking at and cleaning up all the various places of stashing stuff,
across a number of different systems and devices.  I also wanted to ensure
that I could do this consistently, whether it was work-related or personal,
so I invested in cleaning up my personal documents as well, not just those
related to work.  And, if I&#8217;m honest, I still have a ways to go (at some
point I just created an Uncategorized folder that stored everything I
hadn&#8217;t yet sorted and will slowly go through that, deleting what I no
longer need or care about, and moving around those things that I do).  In
many respects, this is likely to be my &#8220;Christmas project&#8221; this year, so I
can start 2024 feeling very organized and&nbsp;tidy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s astonishing how much data I&#8217;ve collected and a number of things
(notes, files, etc.) that I did organize can probably be deleted as well&#8230;
not everything has to be hung onto forever!  I&#8217;m a bit of a digital packrat
and blame my mom for that (being technologically illiterate, she&#8217;s
definitely a physical items packrat).  Regardless, having one consistent
method to organize all systems has had a number of distinct advantages that
are already making me more&nbsp;productive:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am starting to remember the numbers so content is easier to&nbsp;find</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t have to guess how I organized things depending on which system
  I&#8217;m currently using, which reduces a lot of mental&nbsp;energy</li>
<li>Things just feel&nbsp;tidier!</li>
</ul>
<p>All that to say, it was a fairly hefty lift with all of the &#8220;technical
debt&#8221; I was carrying.  And while my method might not work exactly for you,
hopefully by sharing I&#8217;ve given some ideas that may make you a wee bit more
productive as well.  It&#8217;s about the consistent application of a method
across all tools and storage mechanisms that I find to be more important
than the tools themselves.  I know well enough that tools come and go, but
the method to keep you sane should stay the&nbsp;same!</p>
<p>This blog doesn&#8217;t have comments, so hit me up on Twitter if you have any
thoughts or comments you&#8217;d like to share with me, or even recommendations.
I&#8217;m always trying to make myself more efficient and manage my systems vs
letting them manage&nbsp;me.</p>
