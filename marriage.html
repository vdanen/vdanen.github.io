            <p>This is a list of marriage content from <span class="caps">NAME</span> (National Association of
Marriage Enhancement) Canada.  <span class="caps">NAME</span> no longer functions as an entity, yet
this material is Biblical and timeless and we use it for marriage
counseling at Christcity&nbsp;Church.</p>
<p>The material here is being made available so it can help as many people as
possible, the way that we believe both God and Pastor Leo&nbsp;intended.</p>
<p>Apologies for the quality, some of the recordings are quite old and don&#8217;t
sound amazing but the content is outstanding.  Each is available in <span class="caps">MP3</span>&nbsp;format.</p>

<p>A major cause of trouble in relationships is when one or both spouses feel
insecure.  Security leads to trust and intimacy.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so
important to &#8220;cover&#8221; each other, the way a warm comforter covers us on a
cold winter morning.  These eight powerful and dynamic and live changing
messages reveal God&#8217;s truth about the concept of &#8220;Covering.&#8221;
<a href="https://marriage.annvix.com/covered">Link</a></p>
<h2 id="true-trust"><a href="https://marriage.annvix.com/true-trust">True Trust</a><a class="headerlink" href="#true-trust" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>A surprising and powerfully profound teaching on developing properly placed
trust will help every marriage.  Significant understanding of how trust
breaks down and what it takes to rebuild trust in relationships is a vital
part of healthy, fear-free intimacy in marriage.  Turning trust breakers
into trust builders empowers any spouse to take what could be traumas and
utilize them to increase confidence and reliance on God to see couples grow
through their trials.  This teaching series has been life changing for
couples who have gone through long periods of broken trust, while also
helping newlyweds develop the means to avoid patterns of distrust.

<p>Strength Based Marriages: Marriages are not destroyed by differences but
by seflish responses to differences.  Learn how to appreciate, be thankful
for, and enjoy these&nbsp;differences.</p>
<p>Fear Factor or Faith Factor: Be more than a conqueror, most than an
overcomer in your marriage.  Learn how to stop wandering in the wilderness
of &#8220;what-ifs&#8221; and see the strength, the glory, and the opportunity in&nbsp;situations.</p>
<p>Wired for Strength: Each person is wired by God with specific strengths and
His specific purpose.  Learn how to be comrades in a mission rather than&nbsp;combatants.</p>
<p>Chooser or Muser?: Accepting each other as unique; unique in approach and
uniquely utilized by God for His purpose.
