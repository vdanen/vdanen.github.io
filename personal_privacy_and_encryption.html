            <p>Your data is <b><i>your</i></b> data. What belongs to you should stay with you, until you choose to give it away. Your personal data shouldn’t be subject to theft. It’s for this reason that banks use <span class="caps">SSL</span> on their websites; to protect your data in transit. Obviously, banking online without using <span class="caps">SSL</span> to protect your bank account information, balance information, and passwords to access your account, should not be an option for anyone. Only a foolish person would attempt it.
</p>
<p>While banking information is extremely important, so is the information on your own system. Whether corporate or a home user, data integrity is vital. Most people know to make backups, to retain their data in the event of a crash. So what do you do when your laptop is stolen or someone breaks into your system? You have a backup, right?
</p>
<p>What about the stuff that requires more than a simple backup? Think <span class="caps">GPG</span> or <span class="caps">PGP</span> private keys. Think <span class="caps">SSH</span> private keys. Think accounting information with the same data contained at the bank that you so meticulously ensure you only connect via <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> to obtain. Is a backup of this data enough?
</p>
<p>Of course not. If someone obtains your <span class="caps">GPG</span> private key, they can, in essence, take over an online persona. They can send messages as you, using your key. If someone obtains your <span class="caps">SSH</span> private key, any accounts you connect to using the key, likely passwordless, are open for them to login to. Granted, both <span class="caps">GPG</span> and <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys should use a passphrase… how good was your passphrase again? They may not be able to access that data immediately, if you use a good passphrase. Another reason for a good one.
</p>

<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Local_Privacy_and_Encryption">Local Privacy and Encryption</span></h1>
<p>Take the good passphrase one step further. Use an encrypted loopback filesystem to store your <span class="caps">GPG</span> and <span class="caps">SSH</span> data. This offers you a few advantages. It’s another layer of protection between a thief and your personal data. It prevents people from looking at some of the data that can be useful immediately. For instance, while you may have your <span class="caps">SSH</span> private key adequately protected via a passphrase, the data stored in the known_hosts file is stored in the clear; this gives a thief an excellent overview of what remote systems you connect to, and may give them one known username on those remote systems. If you maintain a <span style="font-family: courier; color: #891214; font-style: italic; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold;">~/.ssh/config</span> file, there is data there that no one other than yourself should have access to either. In short, protecting the entire <span style="font-family: courier; color: #891214; font-style: italic; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold;">~/.ssh</span> and/or <span style="font-family: courier; color: #891214; font-style: italic; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold;">~/.gnupg</span> directories is vital, <b><i>especially</i></b> on something like a laptop.
</p>
<p>Of course, using an encrypted filesystem is useful for more than just private keys for <span class="caps">SSH</span> and <span class="caps">GPG</span>/<span class="caps">PGP</span>. They are useful for holding data files for banking or accounting software, documents that may be sensitive or personal such as resumes, and more. One day, all filesystems should offer encryption as a choice, preventing using loopback filesystems as “containers”, or similar software solutions (such as <span class="caps">PGP</span> Disk).
</p>
<p>On a side note, using small keychain <span class="caps">USB</span> memory sticks that can be mounted as filesystems is an option as well, although encrypting the data on the removable device should be mandatory (which is easier to lose? keys or a laptop?). Storing these encrypted filesystems on such a device adds yet another layer of protection.
</p>
<p>There are a few different ways you can accomplish this. We’ll look at a few of them here.
</p>

<li> Using <span class="caps">CFS</span></li>
<li> Encrypted loopback filesystems</li></ul>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Secure_Communications_Over_Insecure_Networks">Secure Communications Over Insecure Networks</span></h1>
<p>Another important aspect to personal privacy is secure communications. This means being able to communicate with others securely; sending encrypted emails or files that others cannot read, but only the intended recipient. There are a few different ways to handle this sort of private communication; two very big ones are <span class="caps">PGP</span> and GnuPG, both of which require the use of private and public keys. There are other means of securing personal communications, which we will also look at.
</p>
<p>Both <span class="caps">PGP</span> and <span class="caps">GPG</span> perform the same basic function; the primary difference is that <span class="caps">PGP</span> is a commercial product and <span class="caps">GPG</span> (GnuPG) is an open source product. But they can both interact with each other and use the same standard. <span class="caps">PGP</span> has clients for most operating systems, and so does <span class="caps">GPG</span>. To use <span class="caps">PGP</span>, one must pay for it… with <span class="caps">GPG</span>, there is no cost attachment. We will look specifically at <span class="caps">GPG</span>, however a lot of the terminology and theory used is interchangeable with <span class="caps">PGP</span>. They do not have the same interface (<span class="caps">PGP</span> is primarily <span class="caps">GUI</span>-driven), and the commandline operations differ.
</p>

<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Privacy_and_Encryption_for_Network_Services">Privacy and Encryption for Network Services</span></h1>
<p>Another means of communication that I have found invaluable is <span class="caps">IRC</span>, however it is inherently insecure for two reasons. The first is that more often than not, it is done in the clear; there is no encryption to secure the communication on channels. The other is a lack of authentication. Some bots offer this functionality but most will ask for authentication once you have connected, not before. There are two ways that an <span class="caps">IRC</span> server can be secured, for use as an internal communications tool in a company, for example. The first is to use <span class="caps">SSL</span> to encrypt data. You can then use a bot of some sort for authentication once the user is connected to the server. The second is to use <span class="caps">SSH</span>, which provides both authentication <b><i>before</i></b> connection, and encryption.
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="/Secure_IRC_Authentication_and_Encryption" title="Secure IRC: Authentication and Encryption">Secure <span class="caps">IRC</span>: Authentication and Encryption</a></li></ul>
<p>When discussion security over web services, more often than not <span class="caps">SSL</span> (Secure Socket Layers) is the defacto standard of protecting data in-transit from client to server. This isn’t always the case; we’ve seen how to encrypt <span class="caps">IRC</span> data using <span class="caps">SSH</span>. The drawback here, however, is that some relationship must exist between client and server <b><i>before</i></b> the transaction, and this isn’t always feasible. For instance, to purchase something online, you don’t send your <span class="caps">SSH</span> public key to the admin, he doesn’t install it on the server, and you don’t create a <span class="caps">SSH</span> tunnel from your system to the server, and then connect to the localhost at the other end of the tunnel. With so many people involved in e-commerce these days, something like this simply isn’t feasible.
</p>
<p>What is more common is using <span class="caps">SSL</span> to protect websites and other services. This is a transparent encryption layer that protects data from your client to the server without you having to do anything more than making sure it exists. When you connect to a website using <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> (or the secure <span class="caps">HTTP</span> protocol), your data is protected with <span class="caps">SSL</span>. Due to big Certification Authorities who verify and sign server certificates, chances are you’ve never had a request to verify a <span class="caps">SSL</span> certificate. This is because these Certification Authorities have done the verification for you; they have verified that the individual or company requesting the certificate are in fact who they claim to be. There have been notable exceptions to the rule in the past, but these are few and far between. Of course, just because your data is protected by <span class="caps">SSL</span>, and just because Verisign or Thawte have verified the other end is who they claim to be, doesn’t mean you should trust them. All it means is that they are who they claim to be; there is no history checking or character validation… so don’t assume that because you are doing something over <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> that the other end is trustworthy… that is something you need to determine for yourself.
</p>
<p>Having said that, <span class="caps">SSL</span> is used to protect a variety of services, not only web traffic. It can be used to protect <span class="caps">IRC</span> traffic, <span class="caps">POP3</span>, <span class="caps">IMAP</span>, and much more (even services not specifically designed for <span class="caps">SSL</span> support can be made to use it via tools like stunnel).
</p>
<p>Getting a Certification Authority to sign your server certificate is a good thing. This allows people to connect to your site or service without any warnings or interruptions. It makes it a seamless experience. The downside is that having a registered Certification Authority sign your server certificate can be expensive, so depending upon your needs, you may opt to self-sign certificates or generate your own personal Certification Authority. To put the numbers in perspective, Verisign currently charges $<span class="caps">349USD</span> for a single year single site certificate, whereas Thawte currently charges $<span class="caps">199USD</span> for a similar package. See the Resources for a list of other Certification Authorities so you can shop around if you really do require a proper <span class="caps">CA</span> to sign your certificate (recommended in the case of e-commerce sites, etc.).

<p>Another topic of interest is using <span class="caps">SSL</span> with various services, including <span class="caps">HTTP</span>, <span class="caps">FTP</span>, <span class="caps">IRC</span>, etc. We will look at securing various network services using <span class="caps">SSL</span>.
