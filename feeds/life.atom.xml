&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are at the end of 2022 and frankly, I'm hoping 2023 will be better.  Is it just me or do things seem to continue getting worse?  The economic uncertainty, war, inept governments, broken medical systems, intolerance &lt;em&gt;across the board&lt;/em&gt;, and everyone seeming angry about everything... this year …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/hand-tatt.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are at the end of 2022 and frankly, I'm hoping 2023 will be better.  Is it just me or do things seem to continue getting worse?  The economic uncertainty, war, inept governments, broken medical systems, intolerance &lt;em&gt;across the board&lt;/em&gt;, and everyone seeming angry about everything... this year has been a challenging one to remain positive.  And that's just anecdotal.  Apologies for starting this off on such a sour note but I had such high hopes for 2022 that were quite quickly dashed and... well, the world just feels like it's circling the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a lovely way to start this blog post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there have been some good upsides as well.  I wrote a lot more this year, which meant there was more content on this site, even if a lot of it is just pointers to other publications, such as the recent post on &lt;a href="https://opensource.com/article/22/12/tools-open-source-vulnerability-management"&gt;opensource.com&lt;/a&gt;, the article for &lt;a href="https://research.redhat.com/blog/article/when-is-it-secure-enough-vulnerability-research-and-the-future-of-vulnerability-management/"&gt;Red Hat Research Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/do-all-vulnerabilities-really-matter"&gt;Red Hat blog on vulnerability management&lt;/a&gt; and also on &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/curated-tested-and-supported-how-enterprise-vendors-mitigate-open-source-supply-chain-risk"&gt;supply chain risks&lt;/a&gt;, so there was a reasonable amount of writing done.  Also I was interviewed on &lt;a href="https://zerobytesgiven.com/episodes/season_one/vincent_danen/"&gt;ZeroBytesGiven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjXrwx5HOvM"&gt;SiliconAngle&lt;/a&gt;, both of which were a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year I joined the &lt;a href="https://openssf.org/"&gt;OpenSSF&lt;/a&gt; governing board as an observer and at the end of the year I took on the responsibility of representing Red Hat on the board instead of Chris Wright, which is a great privilege and honor.  I'm looking forward to representing Red Hat and the open source communities there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have been pretty good at work this year.  Red Hat is weathering the economic conditions fairly well and while it impacted us by having to slow down hiring, it could have been worse like it's been with some other companies.  We had a fair bit of turnover and really saw the effects of the so-called Great Resignation, but we've gotten some pretty incredible people to take those spots so I feel pretty good about it.  The team has been charging &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; this year, getting a lot done.  If you read the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/channel/security"&gt;Red Hat security blog&lt;/a&gt; there's quite a few articles written by folks on the team about all the incredible work that's been done this year.  It hasn't been without its challenges, and I'm really proud of the team and all they've accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nice to get back to seeing people in person again this year.  After a few years of not traveling (which I didn't mind!) I had actually started to miss it. The first trip this year was pretty nerve-wracking due to lingering COVID concerns, the stupid Arrive-CAN app, chaos at airports...  It was good to start traveling so as to see people in person again, but the travel experience itself was truly painful at times.  This year I went to Singapore for the first time, Boston a few times, Raleigh a few times, Denver for the first time, and Lake Tahoe for the Linux Foundation Member Summit, a first for both the event and the location.  Being in all of these places was great... getting there, or getting home, left much to be desired.  On my way to Boston I had to spend a night in the Pearson airport because, after sitting on the plane for an hour to leave for Boston, there was no ground crew to wheel us back from the terminal, and when all the planes emptied, all of the available hotel rooms nearby were booked solid.  So many planes delayed, so many times running for planes that I didn't need to run to, because they were also delayed.  Took my first WestJet/Delta flights in years and I'll never do that again... delays on the way to California, missed the flight to Reno, stayed in a hotel in LA, was booked on two separate flights from LAX (a morning flight to Salt Lake City and an evening direct to Reno), every time I tried to board the system freaked out because of the evening flight they didn't take me off of... and then when leaving and it was time to check in, my flight from Reno to LA had disappeared and I was cordially invited to checkin for my flight from LAX home -- with nothing to get me to LAX!  🤬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50% of the trips were reasonably good, even though they had delays, but the other 50% were really quite stressful.  Still, it was nice to see people in person and it was really nice to get to Red Hat's HQ in Raleigh again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel bad for those who got stuck over the holidays, and those who are still stuck as I write this, as we've had more airport insanity than we've had for some time and at such a large scale as well.  I'm not keen yet to go on holidays somewhere I can't drive to, such as when we went to Jasper this summer for a week which turned into two nights because of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjmyJazNFsA"&gt;Chetamon Wildfire&lt;/a&gt; that took out power to the townsite (and hence our cabin).  We made the right decision to leave after being without power for about 6h as it turned into a number of days without power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of disappointing holidays, revamping this blog over Christmas was probably the only highlight.  My daughter was sick with a stomach bug, my wife's uncle died on Boxing Day, and my mother-in-law went into the hospital Christmas Day with heart issues that we're hopeful the doctors are sorting out, although we expect her to be there for a few more days yet. Post-Christmas has been spent doing a lot of fretting and going to and from the hospital or to visit my father-in-law to make sure he's not too lonely.  Tragically, my daughter's boyfriend's mother passed away a week before Christmas as well, under some rather sad circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite the way I had wanted to end this year but at this point I can only consider it to be the icing on the cake of a truly terrible year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst for me, however, was my wife's health this year.  It's been another challenging year and a revisit of &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/2018-a-retrospective-resilience"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of the year she's been feeling poorly, and we're a bit stuck on how to make her body properly absorb iron because it seems as though it isn't.  She's been on iron pills for the last number of years, and I suspect that stress is a major trigger to &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in her body not working as it should.  At the beginning of this year we started the work to sell the acreage her parents lived on and move them into an assisted living facility that's located a little closer, and a significant amount of that effort was done by my wife.  In fact, she quit her job so she could focus on it, and that's when she started feeling poorly, almost -- but not quite -- as bad as in 2018 which, looking back, was likely triggered by other stressful family events.  We finally managed to get her a series of iron infusions this summer and her numbers were good, but she got her iron and hemoglobin levels tested three months after the infusion and the iron is low again, while the hemoglobin is still high.  But that will only last for so long with no iron to help produce red blood cells, so I expect she'll need another infusion soon.  Unless some of the help our naturopath is giving us works; we're trying different and additional iron now, along with a few other things, so we'll see in a month whether those iron levels have gone up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, from a work perspective, this was an incredibly challening yet rewarding year.  From a personal perspective, it was an incredibly challeninging and not so awesome year.  In fact, it's been probably one of the toughest since I've started writing these retrospectives.  Yet, we soldier on and take the good days and the bad as they come.  Next year will undoubtably come with its own challenges, although I'm optimistic that we'll finally get things sorted out with respect to my wife's health.  So we put our trust in God and pick ourselves up when we get knocked down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite proverbs is Proverbs 24:16: "&lt;em&gt;For a righteous man may fall seven times and rise again, But the wicked shall fall by calamity.&lt;/em&gt;" It's also a Japanese proverb: "七転び八起き" or "&lt;em&gt;Fall down seven times, stand up eight.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess there's a reason I got this tattooed on my hands a few years ago.  Sometimes it just comes down to reminding yourself that, no matter how tough things get, we always get to choose.  We can choose to lie down and feel sorry for ourselves, we can choose destructive paths that just end up making things worse, or we can choose to get up, dust ourselves, embrace hope, and move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: my mother-in-law was only in the hospital for a week and got
out before New Year's, which was great.  She seems to be doing much better
now on updated medication, had some really great nurses and doctors while
there, so definitely answered prayers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>...

&lt;p&gt;For a number of years, since getting more and more into management, I've
had less time to do any real programming.  So a highlight of the year, for
the first few years at least, was to take time during the Christmas break
to do some work, mostly on this blog …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/pelican-logo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a number of years, since getting more and more into management, I've
had less time to do any real programming.  So a highlight of the year, for
the first few years at least, was to take time during the Christmas break
to do some work, mostly on this blog and for a few other odd projects.  In 2016 I
wrote the platform for this site in Flask, migrating from WordPress (I
think? It's been so long I can't remember!).  At the time I was doing a lot
of work with Flask for work, building a dashboard for our vulnerability
management and incident response processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However in 2018, the demands on my time for work were less programming and
more leading, so the amount of code I was able to write became significantly
less.  And for the last few years it has been nearly non-existant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I talk to customers and others about the risk of updating software and
why an enterprise Linux vendor like Red Hat performs backporting of patches
(and why our customers love it), I often use this blog as an example.
&lt;em&gt;Every time&lt;/em&gt; I try to update python modules or dependencies, things
ultimately break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it had been two years since I did anything with the Flask application
that powered this site.  So a few days ago I spent the day upgrading Flask
and it's dependencies, which included a deprecated Flask-Security module
(so upgraded to Flask-Security-Too) and a whole host of dependencies.  After an entire
day's worth of effort, the site ran but I couldn't log in.  There were some
issues with the CSRF handling, where the tokens weren't matching and after
quite a few hours trying to figure it out I just gave up.  The example I'd
been using all year with customers just became a very real reality.  I had
updated my dependencies like a good security professional and a whole lot
of nothing worked (well, the site worked but no ability to add new
content, such as this blog post, which for me is a bit of a big deal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, yesterday, I was ready to roll up my sleeves and dive in
again when it struck me that the old site had a lot of fancy things I had
implemented because I was using it for work.  Well, that old work dashboard
is long gone and I'm no longer really working with Flask at all -- my
programming these days tends to be quick and dirty scripts to solve small
problems.  So I spent some time thinking, to figure out what I really needed
from this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I need comments?  Well not really, most of them are spam.  Do I need a
login?  Probably not, I'm the only author here.  Do I need something that
looks slick?  It'd be nice, but not necessary.  So rather than diving into
why Flask-Security-Too had become my number one enemy, I started looking
for static site generators and stumbled on &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/index.html"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is a pretty slick static site generator that uses RST or Markdown
as source content.  Pretty quickly I realized that the content here was
probably what was most interesting to people, not all the other
fancy-shmancy features that I had added.  So I decided to focus on the
content, in particular old arcticles I'd written (that still get a
ridiculous number of hits for things that are so old!) and the blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few hours I'd written a quick and dirty script to iterate through
the MySQL database and output a number of Markdown files for both articles
and blog posts, setup Pelican, and troubleshooted it quite a bit as I wanted
the links to blog posts and others to be consistent with the old site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look and feel is ok, it's not exactly what I wanted but it'll do for
now and I may monkey around with it later.  But the maintenance is
effectively zero.  I don't need all the fancy modules since it's not an
interactive site.  With it being 100% static, a lot of concerns about old
python modules, updating code when it breaks, and so forth is just plain
old &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels rather refreshing!  And this is the first post written for this
new site.  And with three days to Christmas, I'm humming the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QPQI5QUs74"&gt;twelve days of
Christmas&lt;/a&gt; but there's no partridge
around here... there's a Pelican in my pear tree ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>2021: A Retrospective</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/2021-a-retrospective" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-03T03:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-01-03T03:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2022-01-03:/blog/2021-a-retrospective</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/IMG_5726.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, like many people, I did not expect to be writing this at the end of 2021 and still be in the COVID-19 pandemic.

&lt;p&gt;I think, like many people, I did not expect to be writing this at the end of 2021 and still be in the COVID-19 pandemic.  Simply to get it out of the way because COVID certainly wasn’t the most exciting thing this year, the entire family got COVID in the summer.  It wasn’t pleasant, but I’ve had worse.  Interestingly, that was when I had the flu in Boston shortly after Spectre/Meltdown was public.  Oh how our perceptions of working with sickness have changed in that short period of time.  Some good (let’s keep the hygiene up people!) and some bad (really really tired of masks and restrictions!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I had considered not writing this year and even considered taking the blog down in its entirety.. but by the looks of things, people still visit and find some useful information here (maybe not these retrospectives which are largely for myself) so I’ll keep it around.  Maybe I’ll retool it to be a static-only site given my time to write any code these days is slim to none.  And maybe I’ll post more too (yes, I know I’ve said that multiple times before!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of code, I’ve written some python code this year to do a little digging into the Google APIs, digging into calendar and mail data (such as how much time I spent in meetings, etc.).  A few months after writing that, Google added a feature to the calendar to tell you just that, so it feels like a bit of wasted effort but it was enjoyable nonetheless.  For the rest, most of the “code” I’ve written this year has been formulas in Google Spreadsheets.  Not quite as fun as python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a work perspective, this was a busy year.  Maybe the busiest, although I think I say that every year.  With the SolarWinds news at the beginning of the year we spent a lot of time and effort making sure our handling of the supply chain was good, and investing in making it more resilient.  That was top of mind for most of the year and we got quite involved there.  Of course there was the Executive Order around cybersecurity and that certainly caused some work to make sure we could meet those expectations, particularly around the Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) which I will state is quite disappointing when I read some of the expectations around SBOMs.  Many, particularly in the US government, seem to think the SBOM is a silver bullet for proper vulnerability management.  It’s certainly a part of the puzzle and required information, but not the panacea they seem to think and I strenuously object to the notion that an SBOM should have up to date vulnerability information contained within it.  Simply doesn’t make sense.  The SBOM is a list of ingredients – there are other ways of determining and correlating whether those ingredients are bad or, in a food services analogy, in need of recall.  You don’t print recall information on the packaging of your product.  So there is work to be done there and hopefully we, collectively, get this right or we’ll be producing and consuming SBOMs hourly (which, for a product like ??Red Hat Enterprise Linux, will be massive and wasteful to transfer and generate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this year we were able to add a number of new members to our awesome Product Security team.  I can’t stress enough how thankful and grateful I am for every member of the team.  Truly a top-notch crew.  Included were two new members to my direct staff, both of which were some of the best hires I ever managed.  From a personnel perspective, feeling really great being surrounded and supported by some amazing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I was promoted to Vice President of Product Security this year, which is a great recognition to the team (we’ve only ever had a Senior Director in the past).  So while this is nice for myself, I really see this as a promotion for the team and I’m so proud of them for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a personal perspective, the year was both exciting ?and boring.  We went to the mountains again this year, which is something we like to do each year, and it was amazing.  It felt really good to get away, even if it wasn’t as far as we wanted (we had planned to go to Scotland in 2020 so we’re still looking forward to that one day… maybe 2023?  Fingers crossed!).  But for the rest it was the same old “new normal” of being home bodies.  Which I don’t mind, to be honest, but I am definitely feeling itchy about wanting to travel again.  In fact, last night I was watching XXX (the Vin Diesel movie) and seeing the Czech countryside and Prague really made me miss Brno, so I'm definitely looking forward to being able to go again, hopefully sooner rather than later!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe I’ve mentioned before that my wife and I are marriage counselors.  We’ve, sadly, been quite busy this year.  There was some pre-marital counselling which is always fun, but a lot more of what we call “crisis” counselling this year…  about three times as much as last year even, which is probably the most counselling we’ve ever done.  So that was exhausting but rewarding for the most part.. They didn’t all have happy endings, but most of them did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife also changed jobs this year.  She had been working for the top-rated french bakery for the last 5 years but the owner closed it down.  Interestingly, when my wife served her notice that’s when she found out they were closing so she was there from beginning to end.  My waistline will probably thank me although I’m sad because I enjoyed those every-Friday treats from the bakery.  She’s now working at a not-for-profit operated by our church, in our own community, which is really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I noted in my retrospective for 2021, we lost my best furry buddy, Whiskeyjack, earlier this year.  But we got ourselves (and by “we” I mean my wife) a new little guy, a british shorthair, named Ted.  So we have two cats now: my daughter’s Herbert and my wife’s Ted.  The great thing is, for the first time in probably 30+ years, I’m no longer responsible for doing the kitty litter.  He’s a great companion, even if he does like to sleep between our pillows at night… which was cute when he was small but at a year old he’s now bigger than Herbert, who’s a year older than him.  He might get to over 15lbs (probably closer to 20lbs the way my wife feeds him!), so a big cat sleeping by my head…  Well, I preferred Whiskeyjack (who was by no means small) sleeping at my feet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this with one day left of my two weeks of PTO at the end of the year.  While it’s been a great time off, despite the obligatory Christmas cold, I’m stoked for 2022.  I’m hoping that COVID-19 will become either nothing or something we just deal with, without all of the extras.  I’m hoping to travel again this year; there are so many people in various locations that I’m looking forward to visiting again and connecting with – that has probably been the hardest thing about this pandemic, not being able to connect with co-workers in person.  There is nothing like breaking bread with the people you depend on.  And I’m looking forward to seeing what we can do in the security world – the team here at Red Hat have been working so hard, internally and externally, on doing the right thing not just for our customers but for the industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2021 was an interesting, but fulfilling, year.  I changed who I reported to, which is always interesting.  I think, even in the short term, it will be better for Product Security’s position within Red Hat so even though I was sad to change which organization Product Security sat in, I think this is the best thing moving forward.  The year closed out with a lot of analyst briefings about open source supply chain security, which is new to me.  I even did a talk at Red Hat NEXT, virtually, and I’m hoping to be able to do these in person soon.  I might even come to enjoy them ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>2020: A Retrospective</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/2020-a-retrospective" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-06T21:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-03-06T21:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2021-03-06:/blog/2020-a-retrospective</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/jack-2020.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's taken me some time to even get to the place where I wanted to stop and think about 2020.  We're just over 2 months into 2021 and I've been thinking about writing this since December, but between being plain old tired (physically and mentally) and being busy, every time …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/jack-2020.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's taken me some time to even get to the place where I wanted to stop and think about 2020.  We're just over 2 months into 2021 and I've been thinking about writing this since December, but between being plain old tired (physically and mentally) and being busy, every time the thought of writing this came up I shied away, finding some excuse or another not to write it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But 2020 was too much of a year to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; write about it and this will be the fifth year that I look back on a former year and reflect on it.  Before it is too far in the rear view mirror... well, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 started off like any other recent year for me.  In the first 9 weeks I was in Boston twice and Raleigh once.  The pace was similar to prior years, until I was in Raleigh the first week of March for the FIRST PSIRT TC and I remember being in the hotel room in the evenings, watching the news as more cases of COVID-19 were appearing in North America and I distinctly remember: am I going to be able to make it home before they close the border?  I ended up getting home two weeks before the border between the US and Canada was closed.  After that, we went nowhere (like most everyone else).  The staff trip I was planning to host in Toronto in April was cancelled.  My wife and I were planning to visit Scotland - cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, 2020 was when they started working from home full time.  Not an issue for me, I've been working out of my home for 20 years -- not a big deal.  What I found strange that I did not expect, was not traveling anymore.  When I first started having to travel more for work, I didn't particularly enjoy it.  Immensely useful and I appreciated and valued meeting people in person and getting things done.  The value I got out of travel was great but the travel itself wasn't a highlight.  Oddly enough, I think I started enjoying it without even realizing it.  The first 6 months were weird -- I liked being at home with the family, but I missed the travel (heck, I even missed the flights, which I never thought I would miss!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was June before I put away my luggage and backpack, which I never put away due to the frequency of travel.  I think it wasn't until then that I thought we'd be in this for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this point, I wasn't really worried about myself or my family (aside from my parents and in-laws).  I'm fairly healthy, pretty hygiene conscious to begin with, and I have my faith to rest on.  So in that respect, COVID was more of a nuisance to me personally than anything else.  The part where I struggled was with the people in my Product Security team -- a team who is dispersed around the globe.  When things weren't bad here in Canada but were terrible in Spain, where I have some associates, I was concerned.  Every time news of new outbreaks, new lockdowns, new and terrible events around the world came up I was concerned for and praying for those I am responsible for in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, towards the end of the year, it felt that COVID was sucking the life out of me.  Again, not due to concerns for me or my family, but because of my concern for the team.  That is probably the worst thing because while I feel responsibility for these people, there's very little that I could do outside of work flexibility to accommodate their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw in general unrest around the world from "mostly peaceful protests" that burned down the livelihoods of innocent people to political issues.. the so-called "doom scrolling" of 2020 was a real thing.  Of course, this added to the stress as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then throw in the impact of lockdowns to the mental health and livelihoods of people.  I remember distinctly talking with my wife as we were going into our first lockdown that, impacts to the economy aside, the toll this would take on people unable to work or support their families or even get out to burn off some steam, was going to be high.  We're marriage counsellors in our church so this was a real concern for us because it did not bode well for families or marriages.  What would we be seeing?  What would the fallout truly be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, we've seen and counselled a number of people for whom 2020 was the straw that broke the camels back.  The number of separations and divorces, where forced proximity brought things to the surface that caused rupture were high.  We've seen people happily married for over a decade (or so we thought), split up.  We saw someone leave their spouse and children without even telling them before they were already 300km away.  Not personally, but in our province, we've seen men commit suicide because they could no longer take care of their families, kids commit suicide because they were out of school and the isolation was too much.  We've seen substance abuse get out of control, which meant overdoses at a scale we'd not seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 2020 brought out the absolute worst in a lot of people, we've also seen it bring some beautiful things.  We got to do premarital counselling for two wonderful couples.  We were able to bring couples together that were buckling under the strain of everything 2020 brought.  We've seen kindness for neighbours, people helping out others who couldn't help themselves.  If it wasn't for those beautiful things to balance out the ugly...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumstances like these really bring out what's under the surface.  These are times when our character is put in the crucible.  I love this analogy; when precious metal is put in the crucible and the heat is turned up, the impurities always rise to the surface.  They're visible to see.  Those inner parts that make us who we are come out -- and we all have impurities.  How we handle them I think speaks to inner strength and character.  Do we manage and get rid of the impurities as they come out when under extreme heat, or do we hang on to them and when things cool down they once more become a part of us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not by nature a patient person.  This has bubbled to the surface a lot in 2020.  I have been frustrated, angry, annoyed.  But when those emotions or impurities come up, I try to manage them and not keep them.  My hope and prayer for myself is, by the grace of God, I continue to become a better husband, father, manager, counsellor, pastor and friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before Christmas we thought we were going to lose my best fuzzy friend: Whiskeyjack, my faithful companion pictured above.  He was quite sick and losing a lot of weight and we'd seen this before in the other Maine Coons we had.  Thankfully he turned a corner and, while not 100% and still quite thin, we made it to mid-January of this year.  Unfortunately we did have to put him down then.  Silly as it sounds, I'm happy that 2020 didn't claim him.  It's claimed enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also grateful for my team -- 2020 was a year of intense pressure and we stayed the course and accomplished &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, despite what was going on in our lives personally.  If anyone in Product Security is reading this, you already know how grateful I am for each and every one of you but it bears repeating: thank you!  We accomplished a lot in the most trying of circumstances!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows what the future brings.  At this point we're well into 2021 and there's hope on the horizon.  Vaccines are slowly being made available and I hope that things continue to become more and more normal.  I look forward to being able to travel again.  I look forward to visiting offices and thanking people in person.  I look forward to breathing free.  I look forward to less doom-scrolling and more happy news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 is one year in our journey.  2021 may not be a lot better but perhaps the night is coming to a close and dawn is on the horizon.  The night always seems darkest before the dawn, so here's to hope that the near future -- if not fully realized in 2021 -- will be bright!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>COVID-19 in Edmonton</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/covid-19-in-edmonton" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-07T19:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-11-07T19:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2020-11-07:/blog/covid-19-in-edmonton</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/covid.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Alberta government has some excellent visualizations about &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm"&gt;COVID-19 statistics in Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, I felt there was a little too much missing.

&lt;p&gt;While the Alberta government has some excellent visualizations about &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm"&gt;COVID-19 statistics in Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, I felt there was a little too much missing.  The province is quite transparent and you can export the data in CSV.  Since these days most of my "technical work" is dorking around in spreadsheets, I fiddled with the data a bit.  It's not quite to my liking because the data isn't complete.  For example it doesn't tell you when a person with COVID had it detected and when they recovered so we can't see the average length to recovery, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was more interested in my own city so sliced out the data to just focus on Edmonton.  The chart below is ok and updated as I update (which depends on when I get around to it and when their data set is updated).  Unfortunately due to how they publish I can't automate it like I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may fiddle a bit with some Python to do some more interesting digging with the data, but I'm not sure how much further I can get with the limited data available.&lt;/p&gt;

All I know is it's not getting better and folks need to exercise a bit more communal responsibility.   As the Premier and Chief Medical Officer of Health have said numerous times, COVID-19 isn't something to be afraid of, but it is something to respect.  Alberta did a great job over the summer and I expect it lulled us into a false sense of security which is why we're seeing things get worse.  Having said that, our numbers are not insanely high like other places around the world, for which I'm grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping everyone is staying safe, practicing communal responsibility, and staying healthy!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>An Unexpected Journey</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/an-unexpected-journey" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-09T04:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T04:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2020-05-09:/blog/an-unexpected-journey</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/Hobbit_RECT.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had someone at our home to look at replacing the front and back doors.  The rep for the company was exceptionally personable and we probably spent more time with him than the simple transaction of selecting and ordering new doors for our home warranted, but my wife and I are "people" people so we enjoyed the conversation and engaged with this young man.  He told us about his life, how he came to Canada by way of Israel and originally from Russia.  How his first main job here was actually working immigrations to make it easier for people to come to Canada than it was for him (a bit of a shocker in how long it took and how much it cost, to be honest) and how he rather randomly ended up as a rep for a door and window installer.  It was rather fascinating to learn more about how he got here, how we viewed Canada coming from both Israel and Russia, and how he feels his life is improved living here (another reminder of why I'm a grateful Canadian!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was interesting though was last night, after my daughter's new super-energized kitten (Herbert) went to bed and I could enjoy a glass of wine in peace without our new feline Edward Scissorhands taking to my legs, I began to think about my own career journey and what got me here and, as I'm sure many folks randomly do every once in a while, I stalked myself online to get a sense of history that under normal circumstances I wouldn't normally think about or remember without prompting.  Apparently I am so full of "today" stuff that I forgot about the "what got me here" stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with a search for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?cirrusUserTesting=glent_m0&amp;amp;search=vincent+danen&amp;amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;amp;go=Go&amp;amp;ns0=1"&gt;my name&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-focused_operating_system#Annvix"&gt;Annvix&lt;/a&gt; on wikipedia.  Not a lot there, but it did remind me that I had devoted 5 years of my life to a security-focused Linux distribution based on Mandriva, the last version of which was released over 12 years ago.  I actually had no idea that it had been reviewed on &lt;a href="https://www.linux.com/news/annvix-stable-secure-no-frills-server-distro/"&gt;linux.com&lt;/a&gt; probably a few months after the last stable release and a few months before I decided to call it quits with my last commit on April 10 2008 to 3.1-CURRENT (last stable release was 3.0-RELEASE on Feb 3 2008), so it was interesting to find a review on it over a decade later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I think one of the Sun Fire X4100 machines in my rack still has Annvix installed on it and I bet if I fired it up it would boot... with no idea of what the passwords might be!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the other references on wikipedia were to articles I had written for TechRepublic.  When I looked, there were &lt;a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/search/?q=%22vincent+danen%22"&gt;28 pages consisting of 286 results&lt;/a&gt;, with articles from Feb 2000 to June 2011, mostly Linux-related but the last few years had a bunch of Mac-related articles as well.  Looking through the list of things I wrote about was a definite trip down memory lane, as I used my writing for TechRepublic as an excuse to learn about new software so that I could write about it.  Anything that looked interesting merited a review or how-to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinciding with that, I also stumbled across a &lt;a href="http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/9986/index.html"&gt;joint Debian, Mandrakesoft, Red Hat, and SUSE response to a Forrester Research report&lt;/a&gt; that claimed Microsoft Windows was more secure than Linux, which was also noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2563965/linux-vendors-claim-forrester-report-favored-microsoft.html"&gt;ComputerWorld article&lt;/a&gt;, back in 2004.  Sadly, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Is+Linux+more+Secure+than+Windows%3F%22+2004&amp;amp;oq=%22Is+Linux+more+Secure+than+Windows%3F%22+2004"&gt;despite looking&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn't find the original report, just a number of articles discussing it.  The Forrester Research site only appears to retain reports back to 2006, otherwise I would link to the original report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never would have guessed in 2004, when I co-wrote that statement with Mark Cox at Red Hat, that he would end up being my boss 5 years later when I left Mandriva for Red Hat in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when I started writing for TechRepublic, I was a volunteer packager for Linux-Mandrake (at the time) -- akin to a Fedora contributor today.  I quit my job (in bill collections) and started my own consulting company, predominantly writing for TechRepublic and a few other sites, and it was that period of volunteering and writing that got me the gig at Mandrakesoft, as a documentation writer and packager (by invitation, I never applied for a job).  It wasn't until about a year later that I started doing the security work at Mandrakesoft, preparing updates for users of Linux-Mandrake to correct the (then-rare) security vulnerabilities in our products.  At this point in time I had pretty much zero security skills and, as security in software slowly came to the fore emerging as something we really needed to pay attention to, I did all of my learning on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth pointing out that, at Mandrakesoft, I was the sole member of our security team for most of that time.  We didn't have an incident response process or tools to handle security updates.  Much of what we did was modelled after what Red Hat was doing (we started using CVE names shortly after Red Hat did, our errata (MDKSA) was similar to Red Hat's RHSA, etc.  I built the program and everything around it.  Unlike Red Hat where we have Engineering write patches and build software, Release Engineering to release the software to customers, and QE to quality test, the entire process was handled and driven by one person --- I found out about the issues, backported the patches, tested the packages, and used my own self-written toolchain to publish the advisories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward seven years of running and managing the small security team (PSIRT, but we didn't call it such back then) at Mandriva (formerly Mandrakesoft) I made the leap to join Red Hat in February 2009 as a Senior Software Engineer as part of the Security Response Team (now known as Product Security).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Red Hat, for the first 5 years I spent my time doing vulnerability analysis before becoming a manager in late 2014, where I remained as a manager (of a few different functions in Product Security) until late 2017 when I assumed the leadership of our entire Product Security team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in 1998 when I was first introduced to and started to use Linux, 22 years ago.  Half of my life has been spent working on open source and being part of the open source ecosystem.  I've ended up in a position that I didn't even dream was possible 22 years ago and, if I'm honest, wasn't anything I ever aspired to.  This wasn't even a proverbial twinkle in my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why write a blog post about this?  Well, like my new friend who will be installing doors in my home in a few months, I've had a very interesting and rather unorthodox career journey.  Grit, hard work, getting involved and putting in the extra mile (or ten) got me to where I am today.  Yes, unorthodox.  Yes, unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today's world where we have a huge cybersecurity skills shortage, I don't think my story is unique.  At least, I hope it isn't.  And, if it is, it needs to not be unique.  There are a number of people who found their way into security by means of "accident", "happenstance", or "divine intervention" (I attribute it to the latter).  I get frustrated when I see people on Twitter who are smart and begging for a chance to get into the security field to be sidelined by lack of certifications or training.  If I could hire you all I would!  I believe security is something you can train and teach, if you have sufficient technical proficiency and, most importantly, and insatiable curiosity to understand and break things, or what I call "the spark".  I learned security on-the-job.  When I started at Mandrakesoft, it wasn't with security certifications and experience.  I learned on the job because someone suckered me into the "one to two updates a month" job of taking on security updates.  If I had a team to support me and teach me, maybe things would have moved faster.  Who knows?  The point is that we, as security practitioners who are looking for people to hire, have to accept the fact that there is more work than there are "qualified" people.  And that's ok!  Because there are a lot of curious and smart people out there without degrees and CISSPs and other certifications that we can &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt; and grow into amazing security people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if their career journey is unexpected because someone took a chance on them, I say good for the company willing to take that chance.  After all, my career journey was entirely unexpected and turned out better than I could have expected.  I suspect the same will be said of many in the next 22 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a a side note, in high school, my plan was to become a fantasy author.  Then my dad introduced me to the BBS scene and I discovered a new world where I found what I would ultimately devote my life fighting against -- interestingly, the sole reason I looked at Linux in the first place was to actually run my BBS!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="redhat"></category></entry><entry><title>2019: A Retrospective - Grit</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/2019-a-retrospective-grit" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-02T18:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-01-02T18:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2020-01-02:/blog/2019-a-retrospective-grit</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/grit-success-workthrough-it.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed reading (and writing) these annual retrospectives.  This will be the fourth that I've written.  There are two recurring themes I read from the past retrospectives: &lt;em&gt;tough&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;.  Life is tough -- be that in work or personal life.  But there is hope.  Every year I look back and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/grit-success-workthrough-it.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed reading (and writing) these annual retrospectives.  This will be the fourth that I've written.  There are two recurring themes I read from the past retrospectives: &lt;em&gt;tough&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;.  Life is tough -- be that in work or personal life.  But there is hope.  Every year I look back and see how much was painful and hard and yet, at the end of each year, I see the accomplishments.  The things that made &lt;em&gt;tough&lt;/em&gt; worth it.  The things that make me hopeful come the next time I write one of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 was no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like every year I say this was the toughest year.  Then the next year I say "no, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; was the toughest year!"  Will I say the same thing again?  Probably!  What I'm coming to see is that as we grow and look back and experience new things, it's always harder.  As we move forward, as we accomplish more, there is more adversity to conquer.  There is more growth to experience.  There is always &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; that we strive for and in that striving comes cost and sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we say about this year?  We'll start on the work side of things.  When I look at what was accomplished at work, I'm honestly blown away.  This was my first year of really feeling settled in the role I unexpectedly found myself in just over a year ago.  Last year was hard because I felt like I was treading water just figuring out how to lead the team -- no training, no instruction, just expectations.  It's like learning anything new: riding a bike or surfing.  There was a lot of unsteady riding, a lot of figuring out how to keep balance.  I remember teaching my daughter how to ride a bike -- there was a helmet, training wheels, a bike her size.  As she grew more confident the training wheels came off but those first few "solo" rides saw me running behind her hanging on to the bike to keep it balanced.  And then she was riding free, all on her own using her own muscles and her own skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was like a kid learning to ride an adult bike with no training wheels, no helmet, and no parent hanging on to the back to keep me upright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 was not mastering the ride, but remaining upright more often than not, catching my balance, falling and dusting myself off and getting back on and riding for all I was worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it isn't about how much I stayed balanced on the bike, pedalling like a crazy person.  It was about how many times I fell off the bike and chose to get back on and keep going.  It's for that reason that my word for this year is &lt;em&gt;grit&lt;/em&gt;.  Because without a huge dose of grit I don't think I would have gotten back on the bike as many times as I did, or went as far on it as I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't get into all the details of what I accomplished at work, but suffice it to say there was a lot!  I hope my team, who had the opportunity to live through and hopefully experience the benefits of those things, would agree that we did a lot in 2019 that we'd never done before and there was a lot of change made.  A lot of "back to basics" to reset some things, some pivoting, some chasing of new things that have profound impact on not just us but our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back I feel really good about what was accomplished this year, even if there were some mishaps.  I also feel good about finishing ALDP (Advanced Leadership Development Program), which consumed a lot of time and effort for the first 6 months of the year.  Graduating that program was, to me, a huge benefit.  Not for my career, although there is that, but for me personally.  I learned a lot about myself through that program that I might not have learned otherwise.  When you're stretched to the point where you're ready to snap -- yet stay held together -- you learn a lot about what your capacity is, about the load you can bear... even if just for a time (and I certainly wouldn't recommend doing it for a prolonged period of time!).  One of the things I appreciate about Red Hat is the investment in people -- growing and stretching leaders in hugely positive ways so that we can take what we learn to then grow and stretch those we are responsible for.  Our whole point as leaders is to grow and build people, so programs like this are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midway through the year we got our new "parents in blue" and I don't have much to say about that aside from it made things feel different and challenging at a meta level.  The day-to-day didn't change, at least not for me or my team, but the feeling of no longer being masters of our own destiny was there.  Whether this is an accurate statement or just a feeling remains to be seen... I'm well aware that feelings are often wrong so, as they say, the proof is in the pudding.  I did get a chance to meet with the IBM PSIRT in person which was cool and I think they're a great crew.  We'll see what that means for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the personal side of things.... well, life continues to be messy.  The health challenges my wife was facing last October are unfortunately back again and we still have no answers.  But now we recognize the symptoms and can manage them even if we don't yet know the underlying cause.  Hopefully we will have answers soon this time around.  Honestly, the last year with her has been a gift because I know that without God's intervention she would have died a year ago.  It is a bonafide miracle that she was around this year, and I'm immensely grateful for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter became an adult this year which has proven to be interesting.  All the things the father of a daughter knows is coming are here now -- she is her own person and making her own way in the world.  I only hope I did a good enough job!  She's shown a lot of grit this year in her own way and while she didn't do everything the way I would have or wanted her to (makes sense, she is her own person), she's done pretty good.  Especially the last few months of her schooling, I've seen her adapt to the new realities of adulthood and I couldn't be prouder.  2020 will be a good year for her, I think, as she's getting out the gate well and really wants to do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's even reading David Allen's GTD book which is pretty astonishing =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I've done far too much traveling this year.  Again.  I've been to NC twice, Boston three times, Atlanta, Victoria, to the Czech, Israel, and Australia.  I actually obtained status with Air Canada which is a bit mind blowing.  2020 is shaping up to be more of the same.  The nice thing about having an adult child is that my wife will be able to come with me on some of these trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, 2019 was hard -- lots of challenges, lots of new things, and a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of blood, sweat, and tears.  But here at the beginning of 2020, I'm grateful because through adversity you find where your true strength lies.  And when you've found it, and you know it exists, it is something you can always lean on and it will always serve you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a final note, years ago I read the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  One of the main things I pulled from that book was to create a set of personal guiding principles, a personal mission statement, that serves as a compass for everything you do.  I cannot stress enough how invaluable an exercise like this is.  Every circumstance, choice and decision has to stand the test of alignment to that compass.  When you have a thousand things coming at you a thousand different ways, having that compass to steer you to your True North is beyond valuable -- it's absolutely critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created the personal mission statement, and then because I'm both a nerd and a Christian, I aligned them to verses from the Bible because I knew that if they were the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; things to have, I would find substance to support them in the Bible.  I've had this for years and I'm not sure whether I shared it before.  I'll share it now as an example of what is my personal mission statement and, perhaps, this may inspire some to figure out what their own compass is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus Christ is first in all things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek and merit divine help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never compromise honesty or integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitate the success of those who work with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen twice as much as I speak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money is my servant, not my master&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be generous with my time and money to those in need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take an honest interest in the people around me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always believe the best in and about others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be courageous in the face of obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never give up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With God's help, be the best husband and father that I can be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain disciple and properly manage my time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control my emotions, never let them control me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sit here taking my first real break of the year, suffering with fever, chills and a ridiculously stuffy nose that has lasted since before the holidays began, I turn once again to a retrospective of 2018 after reading the &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/2017-a-retrospective"&gt;one I wrote last year&lt;/a&gt;.  Once again, life provided no shortage of "interesting things" this year and since I appear to be doing this on an annual basis (and enjoying looking back), why break with a new(ish) tradition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to define this last year with a word it would be &lt;em&gt;resilience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple other choice words for 2018.  Crazy.  Insane.  Busy.  Challenging.  Frustrating.  Stressful.  The list could go on, but I don't like any of those words because they just define the period in time.  I like &lt;em&gt;resilience&lt;/em&gt; because it defines &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.  How I handled all of those other choice words is summed up in this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was going to be a challenging year, without a doubt.  I knew that towards the end of last year when I found out I would be leading the Red Hat Product Security team, at least on an interim basis.  I started 2018 as the interim Director of the team and the only things in my favour were experience and a crap-ton of tenacity and determination.  It was not a given thing that I would remain in this role (I did not know if I wanted it, or if it wanted me).  Before taking this role I had spoken with my new manager once for about five minutes, three years prior.  He was a new unknown.  My new peers were entirely unknown.  Would I like working with them?  I have this thing about working relationships, so knowing the answer to this question was important for me.  Thankfully, they're all awesome, a really great group of people.  My new boss is fantastic and I really enjoy working for him.  But this was a great unknown for me given I had reported to my predecessor for 9 years; he was an amazing boss and it was a distinct honour to work for him.  I'd changed roles a few times in Product Security in the last few years but my manager was my single constant throughout that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I also went with some friends from our church and my family to take a 2.5 week tour of Israel, Egypt and Jordan which was awesome.  It was time off but I think I "worked" harder on that trip than I do at work (at least insofar as the walking is concerned!).  Shortly after we came back, it was to the permanency of my role within Red Hat Product Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which kicked off a whole new level of responsibility and ownership for a team that I have had the amazing privilege of working with for almost a decade.  There was a ton to learn, a whole world of "stuff" that I never had to think about before.  The weight of this responsibility settled on my shoulders and I think it actually settled pretty well.  At least it felt &lt;em&gt;comfortable&lt;/em&gt;.  Hard to describe, honestly, but I never felt overwhelmed.  Out of my depth at times, certainly.  There were days that the "imposter syndrome" felt very very real.  And this year I pushed harder, worked harder, worked longer, than I ever had before in the past.  And while there were weeks that felt really rough and were really draining, I didn't ever feel empty or drained.  I think the sheer challenge in and of itself energized me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, from a work perspective, this was a very busy, very challenging, but very &lt;em&gt;fulfilling&lt;/em&gt; year.  I found how to be resilient and adapt to the change and come out of it at the end of the year better than I went into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the personal side, things this year were also tough.  There were some really significant medical things to deal with, from a family member suffering with depression, to another with acute pancreatitis, to another with a bleed in the brain, and finally to my own wife who by the doctors accounts really shouldn't be celebrating Christmas with us this year (but who, by the grace of God, is!).  Thankfully all of these are either resolved or looking so much better, but this was a real personal strain on me this year, while at the same time trying to lead my amazing team and grow into the role I thought I would have had a lot more time to prepare for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either one of these personal or professional scenarios on its own is pretty tough.  When you throw both of them together, it's been one heck of a year.  But here I sit, writing this at the end of the year, looking back on all of these challenges and feeling no worse for it.  (I do actually feel worse right now having gotten my daughter's cold.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having a conversation with some other leaders in Red Hat earlier this month as part of the ALDP (Advanced Leadership Development Program) that I am in, and we were talking about resiliency.  Resilience was defined as: &lt;em&gt;how quickly and effectively you are able to take steps that are positive and moving forward in the face of adversity or challenges&lt;/em&gt;.  Without that conversation and that definition, I probably wouldn't have defined 2018 by &lt;em&gt;resilience&lt;/em&gt;.  However when I look back over the last year, it simply must be defined that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the purpose behind sharing this?  Well, I've learned that resilience isn't necessarily something that you're born with and it can certainly be learned.  Like a muscle exercised over time you can grow your resilience.  I look at 2018 as setting me up to handle the challenges I'm sure to be facing ahead (without pointing to the big... ummm... "purple elephant" in the room).  This muscle has been exercised a lot this year.  With the perspective of time and distance, I can honestly say that it is stronger now (and was probably stronger than I thought to begin with).  I imagine this is true for most of those reading this if you're honest with yourself.  None of us thinks we can do it until we're put into a position where we have no choice &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; to do it.  The amazing adaptability of humans will never cease to amaze me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I've realized is that the world is much more volatile and the pace of change is increasing.  We all &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be more resilient in this volatile, uncertain and ever-changing environment.  Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher, once said, "Change is the only constant."  How true this is.  Jesus, in Matt 6:34 said, "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."  This too is absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can paralyze ourselves with what-ifs.  All we can really do is take care of today and prepare for tomorrow.  Worrying and stressing about it, or what it might bring, does us no good.  Doing the best that you can &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; is all anyone can ever ask and honestly it's all you can deliver.  You can't deliver tomorrow today, so why worry about it?  Show up at your best today and worry about tomorrow, well, tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I think a lot of what kept me going through everything this year boils down to a number of factors.  First and foremost is my relationship with Jesus.  I am simply no good without Him.  Secondly, the faith and support of my amazing wife who put up with a 390% increase in travel this year compared to last year, not to mention a 50% increase in time spent working.  I am simply no good without her.  And finally to my amazing team, who put up with me for more hours a week than they probably should have had to and who do such a stellar job and, for the most part, make my job pretty straightforward.  I could not do what I do without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said last year that I would blog more.  That didn't happen, unfortunately.  I make no promises for next year... we'll see what happens.  I hope everyone had an amazing Christmas with friends and family, as well as a safe and prosperous New Year!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>Stonecutters</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/stonecutters" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-15T04:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-08-15T04:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2018-08-15:/blog/stonecutters</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/stonecutters.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the parable of the stonecutters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the parable of the stonecutters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favourite parables/stories because it speaks of purpose and passion in a very simple to understand way.  If you’ve not heard the parable before, let me relay it briefly.  There are three stonecutters doing the same, back breaking, tedious, difficult work of cutting stone.  This is not an easy job.  There’s no air conditioning.  There’s no power tools.  There is simply you, a chisel, and stone.  Imagine the effort, the heat… the day after day effort of doing the same thing, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day a traveler comes down the road and sees these three men, working away cutting stone.  He asks the first man what it is that he is doing and the man replies that he is cutting stone.  The traveler moves on to the second man and asks the same question and the man replies that he is building a wall.  Finally, he moves on to the third man and asks him the same question to which the third man replies, “I’m building a cathedral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each man is doing the same work, putting in the same effort.  The first man is clearly there for the sake of the job -- he does what he needs to do to collect the money he is going to be paid.  This man had a &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second man sees a little further than the work itself.  While he’s not laying the stone in the wall, he knows the purpose for which he works.  He knows what his work contributes to.  This man had a &lt;em&gt;career&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third man, however, saw beyond the work of his hands and even where the stone he was cutting would be laid.  He saw the big picture, he saw the end result.  This man, although he was doing the same work as the others, had been inspired with a vision.  This man had a &lt;em&gt;calling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine each man also had a different response to the work.  When all you see is the stone, with no idea of its place, perhaps the finished product doesn’t matter so much.  After all, you’re given the dimensions, you know how big to make the pieces, but what happens after that doesn’t really matter.  I expect this man wasn’t so precise in the work he was doing.  Maybe he took shortcuts just to get the job done quicker.  Maybe it didn’t matter to him if a cut wasn’t perfect or the size was slightly off.  After all, what difference did it make?  He was simply there to do a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second probably took a little more pride in his work.  After all, he knew someone else after him would take the stone he cut and would fit it into the wall.  Maybe his measurements were more precise, the cuts smoother to ensure the pieces fit together.  He knew what the stone was for and he knew they would have to fit well together.  Perhaps he took a bit more care to roughen the edges of the stone so the grout would hold the pieces together better.  At any rate, he knew the project, the work, was bigger than just the stone he was cutting in the moment and I imagine his effort rose with that belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third man, however, looked at his work in an entirely different light.  This man knew he was doing more than just cutting stone, knew he was contributing to something grander than just a wall.  This man I imagine putting in the time and effort to make sure the stone was cut to perfection… every piece just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;.  Whether this stone he was cutting would be used for a wall or a buttress or the floor, it didn’t matter.  He cut it to exact dimensions, he ensured each piece was beautiful.  He wasn’t building a simple building or a road, he was building something grand and majestic and he put in the time, patience, effort, and all of his skill because he knew he was contributing to something great, something that would survive him, something that would benefit many people and be admired by them.  I imagine this man put his heart and soul into it and would accept nothing less than precision because what he was helping make would be incredible -- beyond what one man could make himself.  He was a part of it, he contributed to it, his pieces helped make this cathedral a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story came to my mind as I was watching my garage get constructed this week.  The first crew that came in to pour the cement were an interesting bunch.  They showed up to do the work, usually late.  They came and dug out where the concrete pad would sit one day.  Two days later they framed it.  The next day they poured the concrete.  A week and a half later they came and dug out the sidewalk in the backyard, which was meant to be 3’ across yet they used a 6’ skid steer to dig out the path.  And tore the lawn to pieces while they did it.  Then tore up the driveway so badly that they needed to replace the gravel.  And left a pile of dirt that still needs to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They framed up the sidewalk and apron to the garage four days ago.  They were meant to have the concrete done before the garage was framed.  They guaranteed they would be here yesterday, the day the framing was to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could arguably say they were doing the job they were paid to do.  But they were careless.  They didn’t respect the property they were on.  They left nails in the alley, empty water bottles and orange peels on my deck, nails in the yard.  This crew was the first man.  They did their job, technically (I do, after all, have concrete in place).  Because they chose an expedient way to do the work, they ended up having to replace the gravel on a perfectly good driveway; I imagine that ate into their profits due to the cost of the gravel and the time to lay it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framing crew, however, are a different class.  They were here this morning before I was even awake and had the side walls framed by the time I realized they were here.  They worked fast, but with precision.  They knew what needed to be done and in what order, and they did it well.  When I knew the framing was going to happen yesterday, I expected the frame alone to be done.  Yet the walls, trusses, and roof are complete.  Obviously there is siding, drywall, insulation, electrical, and much more that needs to be done but these four fellows measured twice and cut once, worked together to get this raised, and at the end of the day I was very much impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I should also mention that they did it in 35C weather and in poor air quality conditions due to wildfires a province over (you can taste the smoke on the air and feel the irritants on your eyes).  And after a long day in these conditions?  Before they even drank any of the ice water I brought out for them as they were packing up, they cleaned the workplace so it was spotless.  Picked up the garbage, moved discarded pieces out of the way.  The left the site cleaner than they found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way these two crews approached their work were vastly different.  They both had jobs to do and arguably they both did it.  One at additional cost (someone’s going to pay for the lawn they tore up!) and one being methodical, precise, and diligent.  The first crew did their job.  The second crew, perhaps they recognized this as their career and were willing to do the exceptional work.  I don’t know for certain if they think building homes or garages is their calling, but their approach to the work stands in stark contrast to the first crew.  To one I’m &lt;em&gt;grateful&lt;/em&gt; they did their job, although I certainly would have liked it to be better, but to the second I’m &lt;em&gt;pleased&lt;/em&gt; with their work.  Would I recommend the first crew?  Probably not.  The second?  Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it this far you’re probably wondering what the point is.  Maybe you see it already, maybe not.  It does make me wonder if we simply show up to do the job, one &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, at a time.  Or are we taking this work and using it to hone our craft, to become increasingly &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; so that we can see the vision, the cathedral, built through our efforts and labour?  Do we see the &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; to our work, the change to the world we strive to make?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting purpose to the work is important.  Purpose is what allows you to see the big picture, the vision for the work being done, no matter what role you play in the process.  Without that purpose, without that vision, you never see beyond the task at hand which means missing the grandeur of what is being built.  In fact it robs you of that connection to the bigger picture -- it robs you of inspiration, it robs you of ownership, it robs you of feeling that you are a part of something bigger than you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all a part of something bigger than we are.  The whole is always greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="leadership"></category></entry><entry><title>Pictures of Israel</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/pictures-of-israel" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-01T22:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-06-01T22:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2018-06-01:/blog/pictures-of-israel</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/41784128904_e496ddb419_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately due to time constraints I have skipped to the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of the trip to post pictures from Jordan (since there are less than those of Israel).  One of my favourite places on the trip was Petra, so the bulk of the pictures are from there.  This is, of course, just a small sampling of the better pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and I hope to not take as long to get the pictures of Israel up (apologies again to those who really want to see those pics, you'll have to wait a wee bit longer..)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are far too many pictures taken of my recent trip, but since I'm being (graciously!) hounded by friends I figured I'd note when some of them were available so I've gotten the first few up, just of the Egypt part.

&lt;p&gt;There are far too many pictures taken of my recent trip, but since I'm being (graciously!) hounded by friends I figured I'd note when some of them were available so I've gotten the first few up, just of the Egypt part.  The Israel part will take longer though as that is where the bulk of the trip was.   I think these ones are a good sampling of the many pictures I took.  I hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, standing on the pyramids was pretty darn amazing, something I had never expected to do in my life.  And the pictures of the cave church really don't do justice to how amazing it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One downside of the trip is that I forgot the battery charger for my Nikon so took more pictures on my iPhone than I would have if I knew I could charge the battery for the Nikon.  Miraculously, the battery did not die and made it to the end of the trip although that was because I was pretty disciplined with saving it for the scenic pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past last half of February I took a trip with my family and members of our church on a tour of the "land of the Bible" (Egypt, Israel, and Jordan).  This was a 15 day trip that took us to and through five countries in four continents.  It was a whirlwind trip... super busy, amazing in a lot of ways, and offered a lot of opportunities for quiet reflection.  This post is the first of two, I think.. there simply isn't space to record both the places we went and the thoughts I had about them, so this one will focus on the trip itself and all the places we went.  The next post, hopefully in the next week or two, will share some of those thoughts and reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left Edmonton on February 14 heading to Toronto, then Munich, then to Cairo.  We landed in Cairo on Feb 15 and went straight from the airport to the Nile river where we boarded a boat to have dinner on the Nile itself.  Given it was pretty late by the time we got on there, we didn't see much of Cairo other than that the Nile is a hopping place at night... plenty of river boats with food and music.  Sadly I did not see any crocodiles, just some stray cats and dogs along the shore.  And a donkey.  After our trip along the river for an hour or so, we got back on the bus and headed to our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, my eye must be very tuned to Shadowman.  I saw him briefly on a building while in the bus... what are the odds of seeing him in Cairo?  It must have been a partner company as he was alongside a Dell and HP logo if I remember correctly.  Anyways, it went by too fast to snap a pic, but it was neat to see nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we woke up to a view of the pyramids from the hotel room which was pretty amazing.  We then went to the pyramids and the sphinx.  At first it was pretty hard to see.. the pollution in Cairo is insane.  It is apparently &lt;a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/user-resources/sensing-our-planet/a-black-cloud-over-cairo"&gt;one of the most polluted cities on the planet&lt;/a&gt;.  My wife even developed what we called the "cairo cough".. it lingered until a day or two after we left.  Anyways, the pyramid was amazing.  To think that people, thousands of years ago, built these magnificent things makes me think again of the power of unity -- people banded together, with one vision, can accomplish fantastic things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then made our way to the Cairo Museum which was neat (lots of artifacts, mummies, old things).  Honestly if not for the pictures I wouldn't remember much... the fatigue hit &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; while there and it was hard just to remain vertical.  After the museum, we drove up to the &lt;a href="http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/09/the-cave-church-of-zabbaleen-in-cairo.html"&gt;cave church of the Zabbaleen&lt;/a&gt; which is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been.  The trip getting to and from the church, conversely, is one of the most depressing things I've ever seen.  You need to drive through an area inhabited largely by Coptic Christians who collect garbage.  Given Egypt is a Muslim-majority country, these Coptic Christians have a hard go of it to begin with, but the living conditions (to this Canadian) are somewhat horrific.  Yet, for all that, finding a happier group of people might be a challenge!  The people were friendly, happy, and very interested in this group of 18 Canadians who travelled up to their church.  The church itself, carved out of the rock, was amazing.  The stone carvings in and around the church were beautiful.  The pyramids were cool, don't get me wrong, but this church was breath-taking.  In our short time in Egypt, this was my highlight.  The trip up and down to this beautiful place was challenging and offered the sort of perspective that I think a lot of people in North America, at least, could benefit from.  It was a sobering ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, we headed to the airport again to fly up to Sharm El Sheikh where we spent the night at a resort hotel and the morning along the Red Sea enjoying the beach and nice weather.  In the afternoon we got on the bus and drove to Nuweiba where we spent the night and planned to climb what they believe was Mount Sinai (up to Saint Catherine's Monastery).  The intent was to go at 3am to watch the sunrise at the top of the mountain but due to poor weather, most of us opted out since it would make the climb challenging.  And given the smell of camel I experienced at the pyramids I was unwilling to deal with a camel ride up the mountain.  A few of the group did, though, and they said it was amazing.  The rest of us caught up on sleep and enjoyed a morning on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mountain climbers got back (and showered!) from Mount Sinai, we drove to the Egypt/Israel border, crossed, and headed to Eilat where we went to &lt;a href="https://www.coralworld.co.il/en/"&gt;Coral World&lt;/a&gt; and the Underwater Observatory.  This was a pretty cool place seeing a bunch of fish and other marine critters.    It was also the first place in Israel that we were, and I can tell you that the contrast between Egypt and Israel is dramatic.  Where Egypt, for the most part (especially Cairo) was dirty, full of garbage, chaotic, and horribly smelly, Eilat was clean, smelled great, and people actually paid attention to traffic laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the night in Eilat then drove to &lt;a href="http://www.parktimna.co.il/en/"&gt;Timna Park&lt;/a&gt; where we got to see a life-size replica of the Tabernacle of Moses.  This was really neat because standing in something that was built to the specifications noted in the Bible was quite different than seeing a picture or model.  We also went to Solomon's Pillars here, which were amazing.  I'll update this article in the next week or so with a link to pictures so you can see them.  After this we drove through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhtesh_Ramon"&gt;Makhtesh Ramon&lt;/a&gt; where a meteor caused a great crater in the Negev.  I thought it would be more exciting, but it just looked like the rest of the desert other than we had to drive up, then down, through it, then up again.  Taking some pics from the observation point was pretty neat.  I spotted no Kryptonians.  We then continued driving up to Tel-Aviv where we spent the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we picked up the last 8 people who were just joining us for the Israel/Jordan part of the trip (the Egypt part was an optional extension to the tour).  Now we were 22 people and we drove up to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarea_Maritima"&gt;Caesarea Maritima&lt;/a&gt; where we saw ruins of the ancient city, the theatre, the hippodrome and the aqueduct.  Then we drove up to Mount Carmel which was exciting to me as I love the story of Elijah and the priests of Baal (1 Kings 18).  We headed back to Tel-Aviv for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday (Feb 21) we headed out to Shiloh, where the Tabernacle of Moses had been.  This was a really neat moment and place because as I was standing there I realized I was in the very place where the Ark of the Covenant actually resided... literally on the spot where it sat on the ground.  This was not something I would have ever thought I would be able to do in my lifetime, so it was quite profound for me.  But that was just the beginning of profound moments for me that day.. this was probably the most personally reflective days of the trip because after this we headed into Jerusalem where we went to the Mount of Olives, the Garden of Gethsemane, Golgotha (Skull Hill), and to the Garden Tomb.  Each of these locations were quite solemn for us as this is where Jesus spent that last night before heading to the Cross, dying, being buried in the tomb, and then rising from the grave.  The opportunity to take communion at the Garden Tomb was an experience I can't even describe.  Suffice it to say, this was probably the most memorable part of the trip for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this we went to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zedekiah%27s_Cave"&gt;Zedekiah's Cave&lt;/a&gt; which was pretty cool, and the Pool of Bethesda which was neat because it proved to be real when many had thought it wasn't (because they hadn't excavated it yet).  It also had a cool church with amazing acoustics; one of the young ladies in the group can really sing and in this church it sounded &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;.  This would be a great place for some good Gregorian Chants!   Then from there we went into the old city bazaar where we could do some shopping.  Honestly, we were in for a few minutes and I wanted out... it was crazy, busy, congested, and hard to breathe.  I could live my life without going into a bazaar like that again!  I'll take the open-air kind or the farmer's markets we have at home.  We then went to the Tower of David for a neat &lt;a href="https://www.tod.org.il/en/"&gt;sound and light show&lt;/a&gt;.  After this, back to the hotel in Tel-Aviv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, we went to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_David"&gt;City of David&lt;/a&gt; which is the entrance to Hezekiah's Tunnel (or the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siloam_tunnel"&gt;Siloam Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;).  This tunnel has you going through water, but there's a shorter (and drier) side tunnel you can take which some of us who didn't feel like getting hip-deep in the water opted to take.  We then took a shuttle to the Dung Gate so we didn't have to walk so far (I will have you know that each day we walked on average 10km!) and while we waited for our bus we watched a bunch of Bar Mitzvahs that were heading to the Western Wall.  These were really fun to watch!  (These guys know how to have a good time!).  We then went to the &lt;a href="http://allaboutjerusalem.com/attraction/jerusalem-archaeological-park-davidson-center"&gt;Davidson Archeological Centre&lt;/a&gt;, spotted the fake Tomb of David (great for tourists I guess?), and then visited the Upper Room where Jesus and the disciples had the Last Supper.  We then visited the Western Wall, which was an interesting up-close view of traditional Judaism, and went underneath them in the &lt;a href="https://english.thekotel.org/western_wall_sites/core_excavations/about/"&gt;Kotel Excavations&lt;/a&gt; which was really neat to see all that is below the temple mount.  When we made our way out, we saw what remains of &lt;a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Nehemiahs-wall-uncovered"&gt;Nehemiah's Wall&lt;/a&gt; which was really neat as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One note about Nehemiah's Wall... according to Nehemiah 6:15, they built the wall around Jerusalem in 52 days.  52 days!  Now it says they worked on it day and night, but you don't really grasp what those walls looked like by just reading about it.  Seeing it in person... that was an impressive feat!  Like the pyramids, it made me think about that power of vision and people united.  The things that can be accomplished by a team of people, united, working together, is amazing.  For someone who leads a team of people, this was a very reflective moment for me... what kinds of things can we, as professional teams, accomplish together if we put ourselves out of the way and collaborated to build and do important things?  Visiting the remnants of this wall really made me think about work and the upcoming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Wall we went back to the hotel in Jerusalem.  The next day, Friday, we drove out to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masada"&gt;Masada&lt;/a&gt; which was incredibly cool.  Masada is a mountain fortress built by Herod the Great and it has an amazing view and is fairly well preserved considering it's over 2000 years old.  From Masada we went to En Gedi, where David hid from king Saul who was hunting him (neat water springs) and the Qumran Caves where they found the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Then we went down to the Dead Sea itself (on the Israel side) but it was pretty much a gong-show with tourists and locals all over the place, super muddy, and just plain chaotic.  A few folks went into the Dead Sea (my daughter included) and floated, covered themselves in mud, etc.  My daughter says this was one of her most favourite parts of the trip.  After this we headed into Bethlehem to spend the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning we got up and went to the Shepherd's Fields in Bethlehem, which is where they say the angels appeared to the shepherds.  It's plausible, but I don't know if it's the exact field or not.  Doesn't really matter, it was neat to see and think about that time in history.  We then drove to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Megiddo"&gt;Megiddo&lt;/a&gt; which is on the edge of the Jezreel Valley.  The neat thing about this place is that the Jezreel Valley is also known as Armageddon, or where the end-time battle will be fought according to the book of Revelation.  There is debate as to whether it is symbolic or literal... we'll leave the theology alone but suffice it to say, it was an interesting place to be!  From there we went to the &lt;a href="http://www.land-of-the-bible.com/Gideons_Spring"&gt;Gideon Springs&lt;/a&gt; which is a really pretty place, and then to &lt;a href="http://www.nazarethvillage.com/"&gt;Nazareth Village&lt;/a&gt; which is a neat little place that recreates what things would have looked like in Nazareth 2000 years ago.  We saw an old wine press, an old olive press, some very interested-in-humans sheep, a woman who spun wool into thread and was making a blanket, an old tomb, old synagogue, etc.  It was really neat.  Nazareth does not look like that anymore!  Here in Edmonton we have a place called Fort Edmonton Park that recreates what it looked like for the settlers here.. this was the same kind of idea.  From there we went to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Precipice"&gt;Mount of the Precipice&lt;/a&gt; where Jesus announced himself as Messiah and the crowd tried to push him off the cliff.  The view from up here was stunning... you could see the countryside and the Valley of Jezreel for miles in all directions.  Got some really neat pictures up here.  No one tried to leap off, thankfully.  After this we headed to Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee where we spent the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday we got up and drove north through the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights"&gt;Golan Heights&lt;/a&gt; which was beautiful on our way to Tel Dan.  This place was amazing!  We got to see the old city gates and an old altar, and then found the place where &lt;a href="https://bible.org/seriespage/9-tel-dan-worshipping-altar-convenience"&gt;Jeroboam had built an altar to God&lt;/a&gt; and told the people that if it was too much effort to go to Jerusalem to sacrifice to God, they could do it there (a big no-no you can read about in 1 Kings 12).  We also saw a Canaanite gate that they call &lt;a href="https://www.haaretz.com/4-000-year-old-abraham-s-gate-reopened-to-public-after-painstaking-restoration-work-1.5089039"&gt;Abraham's Gate&lt;/a&gt; which they estimate is 4000 years old.  This was incredible to see!  After that we went to the Sea of Galilee and took a boat ride on it, looked at the Boat Museum where we saw the remains of an excavated fishing boat that is 2000 years old (they call it the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Galilee_Boat"&gt;Ancient Galilee Boat&lt;/a&gt; or the Jesus Boat).  After this we went to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Primacy_of_Saint_Peter"&gt;Saint Peter's Primacy&lt;/a&gt; where they figure he was when he became the first pope of the church (only Catholics think this of course).  After this we went to the ruins of Capernaum, then to the Jordan River baptism site (this place amused me because the Jordan River is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; clean, yet they sell Holy Water from the Jordan that is as crystal clear as... tap water... hmmm... perhaps Purified Water from the Jordan River?).  Finally we went back to the hotel in Tiberias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Feb 26, we travelled to the Israel/Jordan border and crossed into Jordan.  We went to the ruins of Gedara, which was one of the cities of the Decapolis.  I have fallen in love with ruins... ghost towns with so many stories to tell!  The basalt theatre ruins were really neat to see.  From there we went to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerash"&gt;Jerash&lt;/a&gt;, another of the Decapolis (Decapolis was a group of ten cities in the ancient Roman Empire) which are better preserved than Gedara and also exceptionally cool to see.  We then drove to Amman and saw the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman_Citadel"&gt;Amman Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, in the ancient home of the Ammonite people.  We spent the night in Amman (not at the Citadel).  Amman is an interesting city.. whereas the rest of Jordan that we saw was dirty with lots of garbage lying around,  Amman is a mix of "modern big city" they are keeping clean and "old city" that looks rough like other parts of Jordan.  I was surprised by how modern parts of it there where given what I had seen to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday we drove out to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt; which was one of my favourite parts of the trip.  Petra is absolutely breathtaking!  Too bad it's ruined by so many peddlers of cheap wares that get really obnoxious and in your face.  Some merchants were respectful enough, but a lot were downright rude and constantly in your face which made it hard to really enjoy it.  I think I spent more time walking in the long entry to get to and from Petra just because it was quieter and the rock formations are amazing.  After Petra we headed to the Dead Sea on the Jordan side and spent the night there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday we spent the morning at the Dead Sea which was much nicer and cleaner than on the Israel side (maybe because this hotel resort was right on the beach, and private, so they had incentive to keep it clean).  We then headed out to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Nebo"&gt;Mount Nebo&lt;/a&gt; where Moses got a look at the Promised Land before he died.  The view from up here is stunning!  After that we crossed the border back into Israel and drove through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho"&gt;Jericho&lt;/a&gt;, a city that is 11,000 years old (I was impressed with the Canaanite Gate at 4000 years!).  We saw a sycamore tree, the one they call the &lt;a href="http://shalomholytours.com/the-sycamore-tree/"&gt;Zacchaeus Tree&lt;/a&gt;.  I didn't know what this kind of tree looked like even though I've known the story of Zacchaeus since I was a little kid, so that was neat to see.  Finally we went to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_Elah"&gt;Valley of Elah&lt;/a&gt; where David fought Goliath, but it was too dark to really see much.  This was on our way back to Tel-Aviv and the hotel we would spend too few hours sleeping in since we had to get up at 03:00 in order to leave for the airport at 04:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Thursday was up at 03:00 (or 18:00 on Wednesday, Edmonton time) and from there we flew to Frankfurt, then to Toronto, then home.  By the time we walked in our home on Thursday it was 22:00, or 28 hours after we had woken up to head home.  None of us got much sleep on the flight so we were pretty bagged when we got home on March 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some final thoughts.  If you've made it this far, you no doubt are thinking that this wasn't much of a "vacation" because it was really busy most days and you'd be right!  We knew going into it that this was going to be busy... busier than work or school in terms of time (every day was, for the most part, leave the hotel at or around 8am and return at or around 7pm).  Then there was all the walking.  And hours in the bus.  When my family takes a vacation we enjoy a leisurely pace and visit a handful of places during the day and take time at each place.  But this was a once in a lifetime trip and given what we were going to see, we thought it worth it.  At our normal pace, we would have required five trips of two weeks or would have had to stay two or three months to see it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what we got to see was incredible.  This was my first time to the Middle East, even though I've been reading about what I visited almost my entire life.  It was exceptionally cool to see all the places and things, although I take the "this is the site of X" with a grain of salt.. some of it is proven historically, some of it is just based on tradition.  Either way, if we weren't at the exact place, we were near it, which was enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while it wasn't a relaxing vacation in the traditional sense, it was an awesome experience.  And it was a much-needed mental break from work and computers and security (although it wasn't all entirely avoided!).  And I've walked away with some new insights that I think will help me in the future, both on a practical and theological level.  I've got a new appreciation for the culture and country of Canada, and have a new interest in the history of Israel &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the events of the Bible as our local tour guide Angelina was great in sharing some of the more recent history of the places we were going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'd like to thank my good friend Mario who was our &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/guriontourcanada"&gt;tour guide&lt;/a&gt; (you can see some of his pictures from the trip on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/guriontour/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.  I wouldn't have wanted to go with anyone else.. he did an amazing job and I know it was stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll get some pictures up on Flickr in the next few days... there are about 1000 pictures to go through and cleanup, but I'll get a few up there soon!  I'll also write about some of the thoughts I had from a few of these places... most of this post just described the trip and not what I thought about in a lot of these places.  To be honest, I'm still reflecting and thinking about things and still putting the pieces together... so much was crammed into such a small amount of time.  Even writing this was helpful as it helped me remember some of the things we did, so while this may be interesting for some of you it's mostly to help me remember the trip!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="egypt"></category><category term="israel"></category><category term="jordan"></category></entry><entry><title>2017: A Retrospective</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/2017-a-retrospective" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-30T15:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-12-30T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2017-12-30:/blog/2017-a-retrospective</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/2017-eyeball.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/2016-a-retrospective"&gt;I wrote a retrospective&lt;/a&gt; and was interesting to read it at the end of this year so I've decided to do it again.  What can I say about 2017?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/2016-a-retrospective"&gt;I wrote a retrospective&lt;/a&gt; and was interesting to read it at the end of this year so I've decided to do it again.  What can I say about 2017?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a work perspective, this was a crazy year.  The vulnerabilities we had to deal with this year were pretty significant, things like Blueborne and KRACKS and others that created a lot of work for the team.  To say it was a painful year would be an understatement, to be honest.  We put our &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2950971"&gt;Customer Security Awareness&lt;/a&gt; (CSAw) process to work more times than I would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, just the goings-on (that didn't affect Red Hat) were simply painful to watch.  The Equifax breach was bad.  Really, really bad.  And watching how it was handled was distressing.  Thankfully we did not have to deal with that Struts2 vulnerability.  And there were other data breaches that were bad as well -- the news that the Yahoo! breach was even worse than originally reported, Uber having paid off the miscreants that ran off with their data... there were others and if we thought 2016 was bad, I think 2017 took the cake and 2018 will be even worse.  IdentityForce has a &lt;a href="https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2017-data-breaches"&gt;list of the 2017 data breaches&lt;/a&gt; that you can read.  2018 will be interesting in that these breaches will be painful &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; expensive, thanks to the European GDPR (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt;) which I think is ultimately a good thing even though it will make life miserable for the people who need to be compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the personal side, this was another year of growth.  Personally, within the area of work, there were more responsibilities and more people to be responsible for.  It was a challenging year of new responsibilities.  Very little code was written in 2017, probably the least amount of code I've written in the last 15 years or so.  Except the last two days -- I spent the last two days taking the time to finally get this site updated; you should notice the differences.  They're subtle, but I think they give it a nice level of polish and the entire look is a little simpler.  I've not had the opportunity all year to spend this much time fiddling with code and it was nice (even if most of it was HTML, it was still fun work).  I think the days of putting my head down and losing myself for hours at a time writing python code are behind me, which makes me a little sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hats I wear is that of a District Pastor for Christcity church, which is effectively nothing more than being a shepherd (or leader) for a small flock (our church has seven districts in and around the city and my wife and I are in charge of one).  This means we're available to help those in need, pray for people, provide guidance and counsel, and just be available for people.  We visit sick people in the hospital as well, and this year we had to deal with our first death as District Pastors.  It was even harder as this wonderful woman who passed worked with us when we used to teach at the women's prison years ago.  She was an amazing woman, very gentle and quiet, and a good friend to my wife and I.  My wife used to take her to cancer treatment appointments, we'd visit with her, helped her move when her apartment got to be too much for her to handle, and so on.  It was tough to watch her go from a woman full of life and energy to a shadow of herself.  We were fortunate enough to visit her a few days before she died, although that was a difficult visit to make.  We've lost people in the past and this certainly was not our first funeral, but this was different because she was in our spiritual charge.  Barb, you will be missed.  Thank you for who you were and it was a distinct honour and privilege to be able to know you and count you as a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn't really get much time to blog this past year.  I had hoped to write more.  I also didn't have much time for podcasting either... this was a busy year.  How much time I will have for either next year is a huge unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 was a tough year, but overall it was good.  I feel like a lot of the change and challenges in 2016 prepared me for 2017, which in turn prepares me for 2018.  I think 2018 is going to be another year of growth and change.  There are a lot of professional challenges that need to be taken on and I'm glad I work with some amazing people that get to share in the work with me.  There is much yet to be done!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>Working Remotely</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/working-remotely" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-30T20:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2017-09-30T20:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2017-09-30:/blog/working-remotely</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/busy-1972122_1280.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read a few articles lately about working from home and some best practices for working remotely, and other topical guidance around the subject of working from home.

&lt;p&gt;I've read a few articles lately about working from home and some best practices for working remotely, and other topical guidance around the subject of working from home.  I always find these articles fascinating because I want to see if there's something I am missing or doing wrong.  Maybe there's a way I can boost my own productivity.  Some insight.  &lt;em&gt;Something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably I finish the article, sigh, and carry on.  The suggestions they make are sometimes silly, and sometimes they are no-brainers.  And since I've not written on this blog for a while, I figured I would write about what my day as a remote worker looks like.  It may also be useful for friends and family to realize that just because I'm home, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm available.  Sometimes I think people figure I don't work and can drop anything whenever &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; like.  (I wish!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as a preamble, I've worked from home since 2000.  It's not something I've done for a few weeks or months or even years.  I've been working from home for about 17 years now, and as a result I think I've developed an allergy to working in the office.  I find it very, very difficult to work from an office these days.  I do have to work from an office maybe once or twice a year (usually in a different country though!).  The benefits of meeting some of my coworkers and associates outweigh the temporary discomfort of putting jeans on and working in an office, so I do want to state up front that when working from an office is required, I usually don't mind... probably because it doesn't happen too often.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could sum up working from home in one word it would be &lt;strong&gt;discipline&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is absolutely the 100% most useful skill you need (and can develop) to work remotely from home.  Every time I read articles on this topic, however, they don't call it out specifically.  They give you ideas and routines to adopt, but they don't tell you that in order to adhere to these things you need to be &lt;strong&gt;disciplined&lt;/strong&gt; to be successful.  Tools and tricks are helpful, but they are easy to work around.  So from here on out, every topic has one underlying premise: you must have, or you must develop, discipline in order to be successful and performant when working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, let's go through some of the things that are usually suggested for remote workers and I'll share my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Dressed for Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these sites tell you that you need to get dressed for work, even if work is at home.  I suppose this is because we've conditioned ourselves that "dressing for success" is a requirement, but I expect it's more basic than that.  Just get out of bed!  Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work in your bed.  Beds are meant for sleeping in, and the same reasoning behind going to bed to sleep rather than play games or read or watch YouTube goes here: if you turn your bed into something other than a place to sleep, your brain won't properly shut down when you get into bed.  You're conditioning your brain to think of your bed no differently than your couch or your desk -- places where sleeping is generally a bad idea.  Well, for most people.  This doesn't seem to be the case with my wife who can watch YouTube, roll over, and be out.  This is not the case for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, having said that, here's my perspective.  I am a gloriously unapologetic pajama-wearing person.  My "pajamas", mind you, usually consist of a t-shirt and pajama pants, so I'm semi-dressed: I just don't put on jeans.  Ok, maybe this is TMI but the conventional suggestion of "dressing for work" doesn't cut it for me (and while I may mow the lawn in pajama pants, I've certainly never showed up to an office in pajama pants).  Sitting long hours behind a computer make me desire to be comfortable.  Pajama pants are &lt;em&gt;comfy&lt;/em&gt; and so I wear them.  I do get dressed when I need to go somewhere though.. the idea of being stranded on the side of the road in pajama pants is a little horrifying.  But from home, why not?  This is one of the perks from working from home.  Big thing is getting out of bed and moving to a working space.  Oh, just don't wear the pajamas you sleep in during the day, at the very least put on your "daytime" pajamas and set aside your "nighttime" pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Designated Work Space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people/articles suggest you have a designated work space.  I couldn't agree more.  If you live alone, I suppose it could be just about anywhere that isn't your bed.  If you don't, I would strongly suggest a space with a door.  A different or dedicated room devoted to all things work so that when you're in it, you know you're working (and just as importantly, others know you are working).  Maybe it's the psychological aspect of it, but being in a separate dedicated "office" (with a door) is a great way to maintain focus.  I actually don't ever close my door.  My daughter or my wife can wander in as they please.  They know that when my headset is on, chances are if they walk too far in someone will spot them via a video chat so that's enough of a deterrent.  But they know when I'm in here, I'm (usually) working.  And more importantly, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; know when I'm down here that I'm working.  It's a way to set that boundary between work and home.  Which leads to the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintain Work/Life Balance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the hardest things to do, because one of the great benefits of working from home is that you can take care of personal things while also dealing with work things.  But, without the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;discipline&lt;/em&gt; you can find yourself doing more personal things than work things and this can be an easy trap to fall into, particularly if you're new to remote work.  For me, having a set of firm understandings with myself and with those around me really helps.  So here's my list of required things for making sure that I can maintain that work/life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set a start time and stick to it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get up every morning at 6:30 and start at 8:00 on the nose.  There are odd days when I need to get up earlier, but I never get up later.  This 1.5 hours before I start working gives me a lot of time to get started and alert without starting my work day 10 minutes after I roll out of bed (been there, did that for many years).  This gives me ample opportunity to use what could have been a commute to get myself oriented for the day.  I'm not a breakfast person, so this involves some coffee, some time spent reading the Bible, some time spent in prayer, and some time spent exercising.  Skipping this routine usually means I'm not at my best.  Whatever your routine needs to be, set out enough time before you start so that your work time is highly productive time (some people go for meditation, go for a swim, play with your kids, whatever it is that gets your blood moving and your mind alert).  I don't know about you, but 10 minutes after I get out of bed I don't even register my own name so starting to work at that time, and trying to be performant, doesn't really happen and that first hour of work would be spent simply walking up and not being very effective.  Also note that I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a morning person so when I started doing this it took a huge amount of disciple and not a little internal complaining, but it has been well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of huge importance.  My family knows that my working at home isn't because we're independently wealthy and that the work done here actually pays the bills.  They also know that without the job, we don't eat, which makes it rather important.  They also know that if I can get the work done, I have more time for them in the evenings.  Making this understanding clear, they treat me, at home, as though I were in the office.  They don't sneak around like little church mice so as not to disturb me, but they know to keep their disturbances to a minimum.  I am, however, always available if they need it and no one gets barked at if they do interrupt me with good reason.  I also try (and mostly fail) to step away from the computer and get out of the office for a break every hour or so (either to grab coffee or water, etc.) and they grab me at those times if they need to.  The big point here is to make sure that those significant people in your life know that if they interrupt you when you're working you will be distracted. Those interruptions are costly, and tend to get paid for with "over time" and that simply robs everyone of quality time later.  I am not someone who wants to be thinking about work for 16 hours a day because of constant interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say it takes you, on average, about 10 minutes to get "into the zone" when you're doing creative work.  When you're in the zone and interrupted, not only does it cost you the time of the interruption (say, 5 minutes) but it also costs you another 10 minutes to get back to where you were before.  If you get two 5 minute interruptions every hour, you're only doing 30 minutes of efficient work every hour.  That is not what I would consider performant.  Forbes has an interesting article called &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2016/10/30/interruptions-at-work-are-killing-your-productivity/#45a746a01689"&gt;Interruptions At Work Are Killing Your Productivity&lt;/a&gt; that is worth a read on this topic.  Suffice it to say, if you want to feel good about (and maintain) an 8 hour workday, you want to minimize those interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time away from work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect to working at home is to make time for other activities away from work.  This is where having a separate workspace is useful, but sometimes it also means being intentional about how tethered to work you're going to be.  I used to get work email going to my phone, along with the wonderful dings to remind me that someone wanted something from me.  This doesn't help!  Now, while I can still check work mail on my phone if I want, it no longer alerts me in any way (not even visually).  I can still be reached easily enough in an emergency (a voice call, text message, etc.) but I don't let mail alert me when I'm away from my desk.  While not everyone can do this if they're on call or have certain obligations, being binged about things that I really don't need to care about at this point in time can be a real distraction in what should be downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, given you're working at home and not in an office with it's implicit social environment, you need to take time to get around people (unless you hate people, in which case ignore this advice).  I love hanging out with my family and I have plenty of home projects to do so there is no shortage of  things to do outside of work.  I'm not a big bar/club/coffee person, so am not one to go out to social environments like that.  For me, I spend quite a bit of my time at my church and with my church family and that meets my social needs and gets me hanging out with people.  I really value these times because they get me out of my work environment and keep me away from that ever-present temptation of work around the corner (which is literally the case for a remote worker).  They also keep me centred and keep me focused on the important things in life and keep my priorities in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, working remotely is a huge benefit to me, to my family, and to Red Hat as well.  I find I'm more productive since I've managed to minimize interruptions from home (still working on managing those from work, but at least you can ignore an IRC ping a little easier than someone walking into your office!).  And if I can be more productive at home in those regular working hours, it means that time spent away from work can be had without thinking about work.. if the internet isn't on fire, that is.  Remote work can be exceptionally rewarding, but for it to be effective for both you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your employer, some care has to be taken to do it well so that you can reap the benefits, and your employer can as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy reading articles about working remotely, and see the value in them given so many more people are working remotely now than when I started.  They've not really taught this old dog any new tricks, but for those new to this working from home game, or for those struggling with it, take some time to hunt them down (I won't list any, but there are a lot), read the advice and instead of overhauling everything at once, go for those incremental and impactful changes, and consistently seek to improve yourself.  Remember, it boils down to one thing: &lt;em&gt;discipline&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="remotee"></category></entry><entry><title>Replaced GPG Key</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/replaced-gpg-key" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-12T16:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-02-12T16:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2017-02-12:/blog/replaced-gpg-key</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quick note to indicate that I've revoked my old GPG key (key id &lt;code&gt;0x94BE833CE8B86CAB&lt;/code&gt;) and replaced it with my new one (key id &lt;code&gt;0xBD51CB9670DF9DE7&lt;/code&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;I've been spending a lot of time thinking about this past year and all of its challenges and accomplishments, the moments of growth and clarity, the opportunities taken and the opportunities missed.  I'm not one to get deeply personal in public, and won't get into a lot of the nitty gritty as I write this, but the end of a year is an opportunity to look back and do some self-reflection.  I'm a firm believer that if you don't know where you came from, you'll have no idea where you're going.  I've come to learn that &lt;em&gt;perspective&lt;/em&gt; is key in a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a very interesting year for me, personally, and for my family.  There has been a lot of stretching and a lot of growth.  There have been some hard times and some &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard times, but there have been some awesome times as well.  The security industry is probably going to note 2016 as the year of "the suck" (for a lot of really valid reasons!) and it would be easy for me to get sucked into the same doom-and-gloom point of view, especially when I consider all of the personal stuff this year brought.  But I am an eternal optimist (although I've not always been so) and so I don't look at 2016 as "the suck" but "the stretching".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a work perspective, this year has been challenging.  At Red Hat we have been doing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of stuff, and within Product Security we have had a lot on our plate.  The growth of branded high-visibility flaws has been a real challenge to manage.  And manage it we did, sometimes not as well as we would have liked or hoped, but in the end we accomplished what we set out to.  There were some really big projects (and a lot of little ones) that kept us busy with the aim of streamlining, enhancing, and strengthening the work that we do.  This was incredibly challenging and I can honestly say that I don't think I've worked harder in my life than I have this year.  This was a period of significant growth for me personally as well, and a lot of personality quirks needed to be dealt with.  I absolutely need to thank the folks I work with for being some of the most awesome people on the planet.  I have peers that are amazing and the folks that report to me... well, I would not want to work with anyone else.  You guys blow my mind and you know who you are.  If any of you wander across this and read it, know that I highly value each and every one of you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to go to the Czech Republic twice this year and meet with most of my guys and this is something I thoroughly enjoyed.  I'm not a big fan of travel and it's quite the hike to get there, but again, I get to hang out with some awesome people and work on some amazing things.  Hopefully I have the opportunity to head back again soon as I really enjoyed spending time with these guys and weekly video chats just don't cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So work this year was &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; but in the end, I'm glad it was hard.  Strength through adversity and all that jazz right?  Growing and learning.  I've read a ridiculous number of management books this year and try to put these things into practice and with it comes a lot of uncomfortable self-examination.  Things that are easy to ignore or overlook when you're doing purely technical work (which I don't anymore, in fact I don't seem to be doing much hands-on technical stuff at all anymore).  These are, however, a critical mirror when you're dealing with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also retired as the "IT guy" from the church this year which I've been doing on a regular basis for the last five years and an irregular as-needed basis for the five or so prior to.  That was a huge change as well, but allowed me to focus on more important things like my work with Red Hat, my family, my work as a marriage counsellor and district pastor.  Ultimately it gave me back a lot of time, so while that was a very hard decision to make, I'm glad for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a non-work front, thirteen months ago we "adopted" a 17 year old and had her come and live with us.  Her story is her's to tell, so I'm not going to get into the how or why she became part of the family, but suffice it to say this was one of those situations where God was clearly at work.  Having a 17 year old come and live in our home (our daughter was 14 when she moved in) was one heck of a challenge.  Everything was turned upside down as we adjusted to living with not just another person, but one we were responsible for and who needed us.  And when I look back over the last thirteen months, I realize we needed her as well.  Obviously not in the same ways, but she brought things to our home and our lives that caused us to stretch and grow.  We live and think a certain way and our ways were not her ways and so there was a bit of a "culture clash" that caused all of us to grow and develop that under-used skill called &lt;em&gt;perspective&lt;/em&gt;.  She moved out a few days ago (she's 18 now) to make a go of life as an adult on her own (she calls it "adulting").  And while this is sad, it's also exciting.  I'm excited to see what she does with her life.  I'm excited to see if those late night conversations made a difference.  I'm excited to see what comes of the foundational changes and opportunities God has given her, and He's given her plenty of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, God gave us a young lady to take care of but in 2016 He gave us a forever daughter and I'm immensely grateful for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this year I've been thinking a lot about my faith and service to Jesus Christ and what that means on not just a personal level, but a practical one as well.  I've had the opportunity to speak at church on a variety of occasions in the last few years and I felt led to share some of that outside the confines of the church walls.  And that's where the podcasts come in.  I have no idea where they will go or what will happen with them, but I'm making and taking the time to speak to those who are interested in listening and whatever God wants to do with it is up to Him.  I've written about my faith here and there in this blog, but now I'm going to speak about it as well.  I don't plan on a particular cadence, but as things come up with counselling or things that I read, I'll be taking the time to talk about it, not just write about it.  I think this is especially important in our day where a lot of Christians are going off the rails and are doing and saying things that are not in line with the Bible we profess to believe says to say or do.  I don't think a lot of people who call themselves Christians read their "instruction manual" and find themselves in places they were never meant to go.  So my hope is to bring some clarity to that confusion as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, fair warning, if you're not interested in the Bible, you probably want to avoid the podcasts.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on.. so much has happened this year.  It has literally been a crazy year and looking back on it I'm amazed at just how much got jam-packed into 365 days.  It seems like such a small amount (it's only 2.5% of my life or 5% of my productive adult life).  Some people I know can't wait for 2016 to be over and done with (hang on! it ends tomorrow!) with almost a superstitious zeal that writing a 7 instead of a 6 will make everything magically better.  2017 will come with it's own challenges and opportunities for growth -- of that I am certain.  Looking back on 2016... I'm grateful for the challenges and the opportunities.  I am not the same man on Dec 30 as I was on Jan 1 and for that I am thankful.  Zechariah 4:10 tells us not to despise the day of small beginnings, and if your beginnings seemed small in 2016, know that often they are the essential building blocks, foundation stones, to greater things in the future.  We all start off small but we almost never end that way if we are committed to the growth process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God bless and Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>Welcome to the new journey</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-journey" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-22T11:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T11:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2016-07-22:/blog/welcome-to-the-new-journey</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the first post on my new blogging platform that I've written from scratch using Flask and Python.

I've been using Drupal to host annvix.com for quite some time (mostly for consulting client information) and have used WordPress for years on linsec.ca.  To be quite honest, I'm tired of Drupal, Wordpress, and PHP in general so I set out to try something new.  I have been using Flask at work now for some applications and am &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; enjoying web applications written in Python using the Flask framework.  I'm not a PHP expert by any means, but PHP lost it's appeal for me many years ago when I got around to learning Python and now... Well, I just really don't want to do anything in PHP anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also tired of updating Wordpress and Drupal and having to install poorly maintained and insecure modules in order to use that fraction of functionality that I want.  I was working on a redesign of my church's web site, written in Python, and decided to do the same for myself.  So this is the fruit of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's by no means perfect and it has a lot of things missing (i.e. no comment support yet).  I'm ok with the odd error 500 and things that go oops because it gives me a chance to learn and play with things outside of work, something that has been sorely lacking for quite some time.  It also lets me play with things that I wouldn't be doing in a work context, like fiddling with the Twitter and Flickr APIs and some other things that aren't really required when you're working on CVEs or OpenSCAP or internal dashboards, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also taken this opportunity to migrate content from the linsec.ca blog to here (all of the documentation, which was previously on Mediawiki, has already been done... the blog entries themselves go back quite a few years so I'll get around to going pre-2013 as I get to it).  I guess this is the "great consolidation" of content into one place with one platform that I get to write from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, apologies in advance if this is a bit rough around the edges.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well, I won't be restricting myself on what content I produce.  Previous blogs and articles have been pretty much strictly tech-related, but while that's still very interesting and important to me, my faith is even more important and that's where a lot of my conversations these days lead so why not talk about it in an open forum?  There are so many misconceptions about what true Christianity is, and so many people I talk to that have preconceived notions about "religion" and "faith" that, while my aim here is not to convert anyone, perhaps I can use this platform to at least educate or enlighten people.  Instead of believing something without critically thinking about or considering it (the very same accusations typically tossed at Christians), maybe get to understand or know it a little bit better.  This seems to be a fundamental flaw in society today.  We all want to be understood but take very little time to bother to understand.  This isn't just my complaint in regards to Christianity, this is my complaint when it comes to Linux (how many people never give it a chance because they &lt;b&gt;assume&lt;/b&gt; they know what it is and what it can and cannot due without ever even trying it?).  This is the complaint that Muslims have when the majority assumes all Muslims are extremists.  This is the complaint that members of the LGBTQ community have when many assume they are deviants.  This is the complaint teenagers have when parents assume they understand what their kids are going through without even bothering to talk to them and actually listen to them.  The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't something specific to Christianity, or to "religion".  This affects all walks of life.  And if you don't take the time to try to understand, you'll miss what the real truth is, and you'll miss all kinds of opportunities.  So, moving forward, I will attempt to do that for anyone who cares to understand what true discipleship looks like, and what James refers to as "true religion" which I firmly believe many so-called "Christians" today have either forgotten, or never learned to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, this is the reason why I will not be syndicating content to Fedora Planet like I had with my old blog and as the content will vary widely from just Linux and would thus be inappropriate for Fedora Planet)&lt;/p&gt;

This way I don't have to worry about updating both mediawiki and wordpress.  I'm getting older and have less interest in patching things unnecessarily, so I've moved all of that information over.  As a result, all of the old Annvix content is now gone as well.  I figure this is ok since it's been 8 years since I stopped working on it and while the information was neat as a curiosity, that was about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't guarantee that I'll write more blog entries, though.  I can guarantee that I'll have a wee bit more time to myself not having to update mediawiki.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the old links should still work; if any don't please leave a comment and I'll put a redirect in place.  All of the content moved (some of it probably didn't have to).  The main stuff that didn't were the Annvix bits, and old book and software reviews (seriously, who wants to read a review on Komodo IDE 1.0 nowadays?).&lt;/p&gt;

The biggest "rush" of ink has been in the last 5-6 years as I've actually been able to afford it, whereas before it was getting a piece done whenever I could spare a few hundred dollars (which wasn't often) and it also meant the pieces were smaller.  The challenge with the sleeves was that we had merge these things together to make it look a bit cohesive.  I think, considering I have maybe 2-3hrs left to finish the right arm, that we've managed this pretty good.  I want to sincerely thank Jared Phair of &lt;a href="http://crimsonempiretattoo.com/" target="_new"&gt;Crimson Empire&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt; work he has done on both sleeves.  He's done a fantastic job with everything I've thrown at him.  And now I've thrown my wife at him and Angela's tattoo is looking amazing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite everyone who's interested to look at &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wulfheart/sets/72157594268514726/"&gt;my tattoo set&lt;/a&gt; on Flickr, and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wulfheart/sets/72157640395814043/"&gt;Angela's tattoo set&lt;/a&gt; on Flickr.  There you will see all of the pictures.  I did want to embed two pictures in my post, however, as I think they are quite amusing to compare.&lt;/p&gt;

In that time, Angela has never gotten a tattoo.  Her sisters and her brother all have, but she was the last of the great holdouts.  I'm pleased to announce that as of January 29th, that is no longer the case!  Angela has lost her tattoo virginity.  And I couldn't be prouder.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, she handled it like a trooper.  She went for 5.5hrs without a break for her first tattoo.  5.5hrs.  I know a lot of guys, with a lot of tattoos themselves, that can't hack that.  Heck, yesterday I was in for 5.5hrs and that last half hour was pretty bad.  She says she could have kept going.  I believe her... I came home like a wuss last night after my 5.5hrs, she came home and was just hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'd like to publicly state that those who mocked and jested and said she couldn't do it (there were quite a few, most predominantly some family whom I am happy to say are properly shamed because she &lt;i&gt;smoked&lt;/i&gt; any of their sessions and in one fell swoop may have surpassed most of them in sheer ink volume) were so completely and utterly wrong that I chuckle whenever I think about it.  I knew she could do it, because my wife is tough -- except when I'm around so as to play me, I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that is much more exciting than what I did yesterday (I also did 5.5hrs, and my second sleeve is almost complete!).  Pictures of both to come shortly.  And pictures of my last session too. &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, my one goal for this week and a half off of work was to clean my office and as I sit here typing this, I'm taking sad glances around me, to see that my one measly little goal didn't get accomplished.  Which is frustrating and annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect if I had spent less time just wasting time (heck, even sleep would have been more productive), my office would be clean and I'd be feeling good about myself, until at least next week when it would become less-than-tidy again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously blaming social media here is silly, but it did get me to thinking about how much time I spend on these two sites (I have never attempted to measure it), and what I actually get out of the multiple-times-a-day visits.  There's an extremely low "news value" from these sites, and I'm not as interested in what is going on in the lives of friends and family as I perhaps once thought I might be.  In fact, when I really think about it, I realize that they are a complete, utter, and absolute waste of time.  I seriously have better things to do with my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always liked the lyric "wasting time like it was free" (from a Godsmack song) because there is a definite cost to my time.  If I look at what I charge people for my consultancy work, and if I applied that value to the time I spend on something that doesn't actually bring me any pleasure or money (which, I must add, is a very important thing -- if reading Facebook or Twitter was anything more than a "I'm sitting on the toilet and need something quick to read" or "I'm bored so will aimlessly wander around on social media sites", then I would not be making this decision or writing this blog post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, I find more value on Google+ because it's all tech-related things that show up the odd time I go on there.  I am going to put Google+ into the fast however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to fast from Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.  I've already removed the apps from my phone (which is the only time I really look at them).  And I think I'm going to close my Linkedin account because I get absolutely &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt; value from that and all the Linkedin endorsements and buddy requests and so on just annoy me.  I mean, as an example, there is a wonderful woman who's daughter we took in for a few months as a friend/buddy/whatever on Linkedin and we know each other, but she doesn't really know the work that I do (other than it's computer-related).  So for her to endorse me for my Ruby programming skills is a bit odd -- for one, I can say with 98% certainty that she has no idea what Ruby is other than it must be a geek thing, I'm a geek-ish person, so I must have the skill, right?  Secondly, I don't have any Ruby skills so... yeah.. don't endorse me for Ruby.  Now I doubt she thought one day that she would endorse me for a bunch of random crap, but Linkedin did helpfully suggest that maybe she'd like to endorse me for random crap?  And so she did... probably because she was bored or thought it had some value for me (it doesn't).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook and Twitter just irritate me, Linkedin actually cheeses me right off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I'm going to fast from these social media sites for 40 days.  After that, we'll see.  Maybe I'll find I didn't miss them at all and shut them down permanently.  Maybe I'll be desperate to know what's been going on the last 40 days and will binge and spend a whole hour or so feasting my eyes with nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I miss hearing about friends who love their kids one day and hate them the next?  Will I miss hearing about the seemingly constant misadventures of family when it comes to dating?  Or dieting?  Will I miss people who whine and complain about their crap lives?  When Facebook was new and a novelty, I thought that sort of thing was amusing.  Now I just find it sort of sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postings from my blog will still get auto-posted to Facebook and Twitter.  But if you intend to comment on them, you may want to do so here and not via either social media site as I won't see the response.  Also, there's a few RSS feeds on my Facebook, but I have no idea how to configure the app to disable them, and it's just my blog and opensource.com (highly recommended!) anyways, so I'll leave those intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So February 15th is the day I either return to social media or ... don't.  Right now, I'm betting on the latter.  All social expression will be made here on my blog.  Or Flickr.  I intend to spend some time getting some photos I've been meaning to get up there so as to share (some great pics of our trip to Jasper and the Columbian Ice Fields last summer are my top priority).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="facebook"></category><category term="twitter"></category></entry><entry><title>Merry Christmas 2013!</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/merry-christmas-2013" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-24T15:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-12-24T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2013-12-24:/blog/merry-christmas-2013</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas to all my friends, family, co-workers, partners-in-crime, and just generally everyone else out there.

So if you look at Flickr you'll see the last bits I got done (the flaming cross and re-darkening the tribal Jesus), but not the stuff before that (which actually consisted of two sessions).  I'm so bad for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the pics don't really do it justice as it's a hard thing to take pictures of, but Ang tried.  =)  Pictures of Jesus' hands holding a thawing heart are now on Flickr.  This is probably my favourite but boy did it feel... interesting.  I wondered why I had never felt a certain kind of pain before and after I looked at it I realized he had gone about an inch higher towards the armpit on the inner arm.  That definitely explains it!  Lots of crazy detail in this one, and some really cool shapes with bright yellow/orange/red colors that also use a lot of negative space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view the slideshow starting here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in for a bit and the sleeve from the elbow down is now fully done.  Pics to come (I promise!) when the swelling has reduced as we did a bunch of grey-wash stuff but with the inflamed/red natural "I'm angry!" skin tone it doesn't look like it will eventually, so probably next week I'll put pics up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This smart, savvy executive had no idea how to effectively use a tool through which major business decisions were being made. He had no email pending or reference folders set up, and he had stored every saved email in his inbox. As a result, he had more than 87,000 emails, spanning over 14 years, sitting as an amorphous pile of stress in his inbox.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amorphous pile of stress indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a few other mailboxes (mostly mailing lists) that I need to apply the "Inbox Zero" principle to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also know plenty of people that could seriously learn about filters and deleting email.  I've got friends that have as many emails in their inbox as this guy does (the idea is to keep everything in the inbox and use no other folders... I suppose they think it's clever and makes it easy to find stuff, I call it insanity).  Actually, oddly enough, most of the people I know outside of work do this.&lt;/p&gt;

With so much need in the world, you could post about kids every day, multiple times a day, and still not cover them all.  But this one is special.  Teagan is a family friend, and so I have to mention it in the hopes that there are people reading who will contribute a little to help with her recovery.  Just over a year ago, Teagan had a prolonged seizure that caused severe brain damage.  As a result, she was left blind, unable to communicate, and had lost full control of her body -- but she was fully aware of what was going on around her.  In the last year she has come a long way from that point, but is still not fully functioning yet.  Now the family has the opportunity to bring Teagan to the Life Functional Neurology Center in Marietta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.treatment4teagan.org/"&gt;www.treatment4teagan.org&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of information about her and the treatment the family is seeking.  You can also donate there; they need $10,000 to get her down there for a week of assessment, treatment (this includes travel and accommodation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has happened to Teagan has profoundly affected our family.  Her parents were married out at my in-law's acreage.  My daughter is close friends with Teagan's older sister (in fact, she's going for a sleep over tomorrow!).  Her family is like extended family to us, and we've seen what's been going on.  I don't normally ask for money or donations, but this is a worthy cause.  If you find it in your heart to donate a few dollars to help get Teagan the treatment that can give her her life back, please do so.  We would all very much appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Starting second sleeve</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/starting-second-sleeve" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-10T20:40:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-03-10T20:40:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2012-03-10:/blog/starting-second-sleeve</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So this past Wednesday I started on finishing up the second sleeve (my right arm).

My initial plans were to do the family things one normally does around Christmas time, and there was plenty of that... visits with the parents and in-laws, dinners and whatnot.  Too much food as usual, but that's what the exercise bike is for.  So the 21st was my last working day, and is customary for me, the beginnings of a cold started to settle in.  I think my remedy for colds is to work, seems like whenever I take time off, a cold settles in to ruin it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from a few bouts of Skyrim with my daughter, the major distraction (of what I thought I'd be spending my time studying for my RHCE and RHCSA tests) was helping my wife and sister-in-law setup a new catering/cafeteria company.  Here in Edmonton we have a city-owned recreation facility called the ACT Rec Centre where you can go swimming, rent rooms for various occasions, and so forth.  The fellow who ran the cafeteria there decided to retire from it, so the city opened up a call for bids to take over the cafeteria and on-site catering.  This is actually a really sweet deal, as it's a contract with the city so there is no huge upfront cost in leasing a building or anything like that.  It's a small settings, so perfectly reasonable to have 2-3 people working in there at a time, so no huge staffing costs either.  So my wife put together a bid package for her and her sister earlier in December and found out they won the bid on Dec 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to that point, everything was provisional on the contract being awarded.  No company was established, nothing.  There was no point to invest all the costs of setting up business if there was no contract to run, because setting up something else would be ridiculously expensive.  So once we knew the bid was awarded, the race was on.  The city wanted them up and running by January 3rd (ha!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, to make a long story short, as soon as businesses opened, there was no time for studying and hardly any time for Skyrim &lt;sniff&gt;.  It was getting everything together to incorporate the business, getting into the facility to do cleaning (to start completely fresh), and so on.  I, of course, was tasked with setting up the web site which needed to be done so that they had somewhere to point prospective clients for catering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to say that &lt;a href="http://sunshinesisterscafe.com/"&gt;sunshinesisterscafe.com&lt;/a&gt; went live last night, and my only responsibilities from this point forward is to apply elbow grease and help with the cleaning and organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running my own consulting business since 2000, and I must say, starting a food services business is a heck of a lot more work than setting up a consultancy business!  What an insane amount of work this has been for the last month (and especially the last two weeks), but already some catering gigs are coming in and hopefully they'll all be up and running next week.  It'll be an interesting change of pace for us in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be dealing with their business at arm's length... it's their business after all.  I'm just an investor and a sometime under-paid grunt.  Possibly I'll be helping out on weekends, but we'll see how that pans out.  My wife has taken to this as a fish to water though, and I think they're going to do extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;

There are some various automated tools and mediawiki import/export stuff, but I didn't have a lot in terms of pages so taking a few hours to do this manually was no big deal (and I figured it would save me time rather than fighting with some maybe-working import/export duo's).  The primary reason for this is that I wanted to keep the Annvix info alive yet (that's 4.5 years of development "life"), but I didn't want to maintain what was essentially a read-only wiki.  This way I get both since I need to update the linsec.ca wiki when updates come out.  This also knocked out another wordpress setup from the annvix blog (no need to keep that stuff around really).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, honestly, the biggest pain in the arse was making Apache's rewrite rules work the way I wanted them to.  I still have the annvix.org domain, and moving the subversion viewvc and repo sub-domain is silly and painful (and neither require much effort on my part), so I've left them but still wanted to redirect http://annvix.org/foo to http://linsec.ca/Annvix:foo.  Easy enough without cPanel getting in the way and .htaccess files and whatnot, so I finally got it working after much goatee tugging.  For the interested, the pertinent bits of the .htaccess file I ended up using are below (criticism welcome!)&lt;/p&gt;

I've got Vista on one drive, and Fedora 12 on the other (Vista is around for gaming and that's about it).  So I decided to go through the steps of the Win7 upgrade.  Well.. the HP assistant stuff was ok.  Trying to upgrade Win7 though resulted in this error: "Windows Setup cannot find a location to store temporary installation files.  To install Windows, make sure that a partition on your boot disk has at least 938 megabytes (MB) of free space."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After booting into &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/331796"&gt;Clean Boot&lt;/a&gt; mode, same error.  My Vista drive has 1TB of space, with about 800GB free.  But... my boot drive is the other TB drive with Fedora 12 on it, and obviously Windows can't write to it.  Seems a little brain-dead that Windows wouldn't write temporary files to &lt;em&gt;it's&lt;/em&gt; primary drive, doesn't it?  Going into the BIOS to change the boot drive from Fedora to Windows did the trick.  Isn't this OS supposed to be intelligent though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise the upgrade was uneventful... mind you, the only apps I have installed are NWN2, D&amp;amp;D Online, Firefox, and Cygwin so I guess there's not a lot to mess up in there.  Pretty uneventful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it totally looks like Vista.  I guess the visual enhancements must be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; subtle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Time to catch up</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/time-to-catch-up" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-07T20:07:00-07:00</published><updated>2009-11-07T20:07:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-11-07:/blog/time-to-catch-up</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm in crunch mode right now... wrote 2400 words today, another 4300 to get back on target (need to write 1167 words per day to make the 50k target at the end of the month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not an excuse, really, but this was a stupid work week with stupid little things going on that totally distracted me and by the time I had some downtime, trying to be creative and imaginative were the last things I wanted (vegetative state, here I come!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, aside from having to fix some electrical issues (lose wires in breaker box are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a good thing as my melted wires will attest to!), I've been able to write more today than anytime this week.

The idea is to go nuts and write a 50k word novel during the month of November.  People all around the world do it, and it's quite fun but very time consuming and pretty crazy.  Last year there was too much going on for me to really focus, so I think I hit about 20k words.  Not quite an epic fail, but not nearly what I had set out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I'm at it again.  I've got some vague ideas as to what to write about and it should be fun.  I'm definitely aiming for 50k words this month so stuff like blogging and other "extra-curicular" activities will be on hold this month while I churn out a novel (or something vaguely resembling one).&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday the contractor we hired finally finished putting up new insulation and vinyl siding on the house, and I have to admit he did a fantastic job and it looks bloody sharp.  Pics to come (the eavestrough isn't up yet, a different sub-contracted company does that, so the house looks a bit weird without it, hence no pictures yet).  Oh, and I painted the front door red.  Somewhat strange, but my wife likes it and oddly enough it does look pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to put my cat to sleep last week.  Tika, who was 17, was down to 4.5lbs (down from 7.5lbs in May, and about 14 or 15lbs a year ago).  Not sure what was wrong with her, but she wasn't eating, was suffering from muscle weakness (started falling when she walked and sliding off the couch when she slept).  If she was in pain, she kept it to herself.  Instead of trying to do diagnostics and all kinds of (expensive) treatment, we opted to just put her down.  I think that was for the best; I honestly don't think she would have lasted the week and my daughter was quite upset about her falling and stuff, so although it sucked horribly, it was the best thing to do.  That was my Tuesday last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Friday we got a new Maine Coon kitty who is completely white with a grey smudge on the top of his head.  Feisty little turkey.  His name is Sammy and he's 2mos old and a complete nutjob.  But he really likes my daughter and likes to cuddle and most importantly he's taken our mind of the loss of Tika.  His paws are &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; though... he's going to be one big cat for sure.  Today he and Pepper started wrestling without growls.. definitely a good sign.  Pics of him will come soon enough (he's exceptionally cute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my father is currently in Malaysia getting married.  That'll sure make things different as well when they get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting times.  Been distracted the last few weeks as a result but with the home reno's done, and the cats getting along, that's a little less to worry about.

Sessions 2 and 3 added color; session 2 was done this past Monday (the 17th of August) and took 6.5hrs, and session 3 was done yesterday (Saturday, the 22nd of August) and was 3.5hrs.  I think it looks pretty sharp.  I didn't get pics of just session 2's work, but that was mostly the vine creature and the dragon and the background on the lower forearm.  Session 3 was the nebula in the "ditch" (which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but it bruised &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;), finished off the dragon (the horns and eyes and some of the body), and also one missing bit on the inside wrist (I will tell you, the wrist is the worst).

So now half the tattoo itches like crazy, and part of it burns.  Tomorrow the new stuff shouldn't feel so tight anymore... then the itching will come.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to hopefully getting the rest of the lower forearm done this coming Saturday (would have done more yesterday except there was a big tattoo show in Edmonton this weekend so the arm rests were at the show so we did all we could without it, but since I'm not a contortionist there was quite a bit we couldn't do).  Then it's about 2 weeks off before doing some more work on the various nebula ideas we've got for the rest of the upper arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really impressed with the results.  I've found my permanent guy... if anyone in Edmonton is looking for a really really good tattoo artist, check out Jared at &lt;a href="http://www.crimsonempiretattoo.com"&gt;Crimson Empire&lt;/a&gt;.  He did the "J" on the back of my neck and my forearm and I'm severely impressed with his work.

Being a remote worker for Red Hat, and before that Mandriva, I've worked full-time at home for about 10 years now.  (Man, I feel old!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, there are 10 tips in the article and most of them I do in moderation... separation between "work" and "home" can be difficult sometimes because I hate leaving things undone, and there are opportunities aplenty to work longer hours... of course, the reality is that you're &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; done.  Ever.  At least not with what I'm doing... there's always something else to do... a new vulnerability to chase, scripts to update and/or tweak, patches to hunt down, you name it.  But, I've been getting better at the home/work separation and when I started with Red Hat I promised myself that more of that separation would be coming.  It has almost worked.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 10 tips, the hardest one for me is #1: Get Dressed.  Hmmm... I guess that means I shouldn't be working in my PJ's all the time.

But I like to think it's worth the few minutes of my time to write it, and it's something I've really noticed and I'd like to share my appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made it past my first 90 days at Red Hat and I sure am glad I made the transition.  You get wrapped up in one way of doing things, or dealing with people, or whatever, for long enough and when you get out of the comfort zone, things sure change.  Red Hat is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; different from Mandriva, so I've had 8 years of one way of working to overcome in the last 3mos.  I think I've tackled it pretty good, despite some frustrating moments.  In terms of infrastructure and how things work, and how people work with each other, it's so different I don't really have the words to express it.  So it's been quite the adjustment for me, and long hours, lots of learning, lots of note-taking, more than a few oopses, and a lot of patient people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say much about the Fedora side of things as I've not really had a chance to step into the Fedora community yet, although I hope to do something there in the next few months.  For now, I need to focus on the Red Hat side of things.. and I'm loving it.  Especially the people I get to work with... with an organization as large as Red Hat, it's no surprise that I'm running into new people all the time as my work takes me here, then there, and then waaay over there.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, everyone I've encountered has been stellar.  Not just in how smart and knowledgeable they are, but also in how they carry themselves and how downright helpful they are.  I really appreciate working with the Security Response Team (an absolutely fantastic bunch of guys that made me feel right at home from day one), and the developers I've had the occasion to work with, and the Quality Engineering folks are absolutely insane (in a good super-hard-working way!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish it off, thanks all of you for making my first 90 days awesome, and for all the incredible hard work you do.  I can't tell you how much easier it's made the transition for me, and I appreciate it quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Blackberry Storm Themes</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/blackberry-storm-themes" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-03T08:33:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-05-03T08:33:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-05-03:/blog/blackberry-storm-themes</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was hunting around yesterday to find some themes for my Blackberry Storm.

When I first got it, there was one theme to choose from, but now there's a whole bunch of them, so I figured I'd note them here so I don't have to look for them again when I get bored of the ones I downloaded.  My big thing was having a Today theme... that made my Storm seem much less than the previous Blackberry I had, but I have my Today view again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first site has to be viewed from the Blackberry: &lt;a href="http://www.themestorm.net"&gt;www.themestorm.net/&lt;/a&gt;.  I actually haven't checked this one out.  The second is a list on the &lt;a href="http://forums.crackberry.com/f131/all-free-theme-links-here-163223/"&gt;crackberry forums&lt;/a&gt;.  If you look at this list, there are a tonne of themes of available.  I've only looked at the the Gears of War theme and some iBerry theme (supposed to make the Blackberry look like an iPhone I guess).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>I knew it...

So, I come to the conclusion that either: a) social networking like Facebook and Twitter make you less intelligent, or b) less intelligent people spend more time doing social networking.  (And before anyone hits me, this is (moderately) tongue-in-cheek).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one could argue that these "social networks" are more "anti-social networks" because people spend more time "interacting" with people over Facebook, Twitter, text messages, and email than they do face-to-face.  It'll be interesting to see if in 20 years we have a generation of people that don't even know how to talk to people face-to-face anymore.  I mean, if you can order books or groceries online, why go to a traditional store and rub shoulders with "real" people at all?  If you can text someone, why bother talking to them on the phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think all of these technologies that are supposed to make us more connected are actually making us all social invertebrates (a nice way of saying socially retarded).  And lazy.  I mean, good grief, this weekend I heard from my sister-in-law about a 14 year old girl she's known for years who texts her dad one floor above her in the same bloody house to tell him stuff instead of getting off her duff and walking a few steps.  Repeatedly, despite how upset her dad gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a big social networking kind of guy since I generally find people intolerable on these social networking sites (people should really have to learn to either spell or learn how to use a bloody spell checker!), but I do find they have some use (i.e. contact me via Facebook since I couldn't be bothered to give you my real email address, etc.).  I'm also only on Facebook &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; 1hr/week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's also quite possible that I'm already a social invertebrate so none of this applies to me.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Tattoo #11</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/tattoo-11" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-03-21T08:08:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-03-21T08:08:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-03-21:/blog/tattoo-11</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, this past Thursday I got my 11th tattoo (although it only looks like I have 9 in total, two were to extend earlier tattoos).

Using the same references (thanks, Nicu, for linking them all!) I found out that my Sindarin name is kinda cool but the Quenya name is kinda blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt; is derived from the Latin Vincentius (conquering) which comes from the Latin word vincere (to conquer).  It can also mean "victorious".  Looking it up in the &lt;a href="http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-en-sd.html"&gt;Sindarin dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, I found conquer is "orthor" and to is "an", so "to conquer" would be "an orthor".  It also notes "victory" as "tûr".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the name &lt;a href="http://www.arwen-undomiel.com/elvish/boynames.html"&gt;Elvish name translations&lt;/a&gt;, it has Vincent listed as meaning "victorious" with the elvish name being Turin (Tûrin would probably be more accurate).  The &lt;a href="http://www.elvish.org/elm/names/v.html"&gt;Quenya name translation&lt;/a&gt; would be Mapalon (it uses "conqueror" rather than "victorious").  Of the two, I like Turin better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for kicks, went and looked for my wife's name (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_(given_name)"&gt;Angela&lt;/a&gt;: Aini in Quenya and Valadhiel in Sendarin.  Sendarin sounds much cooler than Quenya in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding one for my daughter is hard, so I'll have to use the dictionary and make it up myself I think.  Funny, as a boy's name Jayden means "God has heard", and as a girl's name it's a variant of Jade (the jewel).  So if we use the jewel-name basis (which me and my wife never have), then her Sindarin name would be "Calenmiriel" although I distrust that as the meaning of the name on that page is "orange jewel" but as we all know, jade is green (bone heads).  Using the dictionary, we get "mîr" for jewel and "calen" for green, so I guess Calenmiriel isn't so far off.  And since there seem to be no Sindarin words for "God", "has", or "heard" I suppose Calenmiriel will have to be it (although if you look at the Sindarin name page, "God" would be "Eru" and the closest thing to "hearing" would be "Lathronniel", so maybe Erulathronniel for "God hearing" (which is close enough to "God has heard" for me)).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>First days at Red Hat, first impressions</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/first-days-at-red-hat-first-impressions" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-02-04T21:25:00-07:00</published><updated>2009-02-04T21:25:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-02-04:/blog/first-days-at-red-hat-first-impressions</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I took my first trip to the USA, ever, this week and it was down to Raleigh, NC, for orientation with Red Hat.

I'd like to say it was an experience (meaning the trip), but it wasn't... I was mostly fighting too hard to stay awake so it all really seems like a haze already.  =)  I guess only getting 1.5hrs of sleep the first night, and only 5 the second, will do that to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However... I was expecting a lot worse than it was.  I was expecting all kinds of nightmares with security getting into and out of the US and it went really smooth.  All the horror stories... well, I didn't experience them at all (thank you God!).  I got through security and customs pretty quick both ways.  The flights were uneventful for the most part (except half the plane on the way back to Chicago was full of kids doing army bootcamp and they all had nasty colds... ick).  Chicago's airport has to be the most depressing excuse for a building I've ever seen.  The fluorescent lights with that grey and blue... gah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of that was the only downside to the trip.  I went down there for orientation with Red Hat!  I'd love to gush about how exciting it was, but it was largely the corporate rigamarole: policies, things you can do, things you can't do.  Felt like school.  But the fine people who were tasked with teaching us this stuff did a fantastic job of making it as interesting as you can make this stuff, and they were a great bunch of people.  Very, very nice.  In fact, all the guys I met down there were great and really went out of their way to make me (and the rest of my "class") feel welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other cool thing was getting to hang out with Adam for two days, whom I had never met before.  That was great.  It's nice to not only put a face and voice to a name, but a personality as well.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got in really late last night, went to bed even later, and after only 5hrs of sleep my daughter couldn't &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; wake me up at 6:30 this morning.  So that's 3 nights of not nearly enough sleep.  I did survive the day, and got to chat with my new co-workers while doing more reading (I think the guys here write docs more than anything else!).  I think I have another two days of almost pure reading ahead of me.  =)  Not that I'll be reading new stuff the whole time.. the sleep-deprived fog I was in today probably means I'll have to re-read some of what I already read today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... this is day #3 at Red Hat.  First impressions?  I'm &lt;em&gt;impressed&lt;/em&gt;.  Everyone was fantastic.  They were nice, energetic, bubbly.  There's definitely a great energy here, and it's not just paid lip-service.  It's genuine.  You can feel that immediately.  They're passionate about what they do, they're energetic, they're enthusiastic.  I guess I can start saying "we" here... it's only a few days and I feel it.  It's contagious.  Actually, truth be told, I had the idea and feeling even before, during the interview process.  I got that vibe even then, and what I felt meshed with what I've been reading and re-thinking and re-training myself with over the last few months... books like GTD, Presentation Zen, Do you matter?, Tribal Leadership, and Talent is Never Enough.  These kind of philosophies and ways of thinking are what this company breathes and, I have to admit, it's both refreshing and energizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So despite the feet-dragging and being tired, there's something bubbling up that's been missing for a long time in me, and I have to admit I really like it.  I'm sure once I get a good full night sleep tonight, I'll be able to get more in tune with whatever it is and really identify it.  I mean, yeah, it's excitement because this is new and different, but it's more than that.  It's almost like a sigh of relief, or contentment... to be around people that put value on people, that recognize people for who they are not just what they can do.  People who find worth in &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;.  I dunno... too tired to properly articulate it I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to say my daughter's got the bug too.  For years she's run around the house saying "Tux" this and "Tux" that.  This last week I don't hear about Tux at all... it's "Red Hat" and "Shadowman!" (she thinks Shadowman is really really cool).  And the red fedora I got?  She thinks it's fantastic.

&lt;p&gt;As the title indicates, never a dull moment.  You get spoiled with new stuff, then have to go back and re-setup old stuff.  Part of this switch for Oden is that the build system goes with him, but of course it's cheaper to just get him new equipment than to send my aging stuff.  No problem there, and probably better.  Except that my host was 2008.1, his is 2009.0 due to some problems with 2008.1 he was having.  Then all kinds of crap started going sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I managed to get it all sorted out.  Unfortunately, it came in really close as Mandriva only gave me a week to get Oden up to speed.  I leave him in Gustavo's capable hands because, well, I had my hands full getting the new machine up to speed, nevermind Oden himself.  Oh well.  Another week would have been great, but we weren't given it.  I'm sure he'll be able to get his head wrapped around it all.  =)  If nothing else, it all seems to be working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my last week at Mandriva was exciting, frustrating as hell trying to get chroots of Corporate Server 3 installed on a 2009.0 host, and mind-numbingly slow with massive rsyncs that will end up taking about 5 days to complete (still not done).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I will probably have zero time to do much of anything with Mandriva after this and, quite honestly, I don't know if there is any desire on my part to, or any desire on my new employer's part either.  I should probably be spending any "leisure" time farting around with Fedora or RHEL at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So good luck all my many friends, past and present, at Mandriva and in the Mandriva community!  Strange and (hopefully!) wonderful things lie in store for me, I think.  I'm excited and nervous, but up for the change and challenge moving to Red Hat will give me.&lt;/p&gt;

I actually didn't know about it until today, so it's pretty cool that after having known Adam for a few years we're going to be able to actually meet face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who've read it, you know where I'm going.  For those that don't, Adam will be a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer at Red Hat.  I'm going to the same place as an, officially titled, Senior Software Engineer, but technically as a member of the Red Hat Security Response Team.  This is really exciting for me as I still get to deal with the same folks I've dealt with for years, in the same capacity -- just from a different company.  So I'm still doing security stuff, but the Red Hat process is quite a bit different from the Mandriva process so I have &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; to learn.  Still, I'm looking forward to the changes and challenges both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to feel like such a n00b for a while, I think.  Have I mentioned that I haven't used Red Hat since version 5.1 and that I looked at Fedora Core 2 for the span of 1-2 days?  Lots to learn and some differences (both technical and "practical") between Mandriva and Red Hat that will take some time to get used to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Gmail...

There are some really irritating reasons why this is a bad idea (in my case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's use of labels is neat, and it makes IMAP folders.  Very cool.  That works well.  But those filter rules are absolutely infuriating!  I like to get some of my mail sent to my blackberry... stuff that is meant, directly, to me.  So it has to have my email address as the To: field, but I also want this to come absolutely last, after all the other filters.  It doesn't look like there's any kind of ordering, and no support for anything moderately advanced.  I found a few tutorials that allow you to use advanced boolean style arguments for searching mail, but they don't seem to work the same for filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spent about an hour fiddling with this and realized that no matter how much technology advances, nothing will ever replace fetchmail+procmail+mutt for me.  It just can't.  I don't think I'm abnormal in how I deal with my email, but for crying out loud, can they possibly dumb it down any further?  Or make finding the information to do anything with it more difficult?  How hard would it be to do a search and then have a "make this search a filter" type option?  And I'd really like to know about filter ordering, because if there is a particular order, then I might be able to live with it (i.e. filter out all mailing lists into their separate labels and then forward what's left to my blackberry).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="gmail"></category><category term="email"></category></entry><entry><title>Gah!

I.e. an engineer will keep working stuff until it's perfect, likely because it's in our nature (I can't tell you how many times I've rewritten code just so it looks better).  It's a pretty good piece on identifying what things absolutely need to be done and working so you can say you're "Done".  I suppose from a developer's perspective, this would be a use-case for milestones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of December 31st, my contract with Mandriva will be terminated and I will no longer be working for Mandriva.  We've got a new CEO now, and he's determined there is to be no remote contractors, and as a result I've been booted from the camp, so to speak.  Over the last 8.5 years, I've seen CEOs come and go, restructures, other remote contractors get the boot, I've lived through the bankruptcy protection, been denied raises due to financial circumstances.  Pre-bankruptcy protection I endured getting paid piecemeal as they could afford it...  in short, I've literally put blood, sweat, and tears into my job for this company and have endured where others did not... I've stayed on when others left, and I've managed to avoid the axe when others got cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that changed this morning.  So I have one month of employment left during which time I also need to be finding a new job.  The consulting I do on the side does not make me enough to cover my day-to-day expenses (mortgage, car payment, tuition for my daughter... food).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess if anyone out there knows of a company that needs a security geek/consultant or a server administrator type, or even documentation, please let me know.  I've got one month to fill this gap, and I've got 8.5 years of hands-on Linux development, security-related work (updates, testing, QA, research), and about a decade of systems administration under my belt.  I refuse to turn this into a resume, but there's the basics (resume is, of course, available upon request... as soon as I get it updated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a firm believer in "plans", so I'm praying this is in God's timing to help me find something better, but it's difficult to be positive when you get this kind of news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT:&lt;/b&gt;  Over the last 2 hours there has been a flurry of communication.  Thank you &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much to those folks who commented here and have sent me emails.  It is very much appreciated.  I am not, however, leaving.  Apparently it was a mistake that my name was on the chopping block.  So, for the time being at least, I am not going anywhere.  The phone call from our new CEO ensures me that my contract is not being terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thank you guys so much for all the kind words.  You have no idea how much that means to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="mandriva"></category></entry><entry><title>Moved to a new provider</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/moved-to-a-new-provider" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-11-20T20:16:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-20T20:16:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-11-20:/blog/moved-to-a-new-provider</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one may be a bit long, because I'm going to use it to vent.  =)  I won't make it all "front page news", tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I signed up with a new provider, &lt;a href="http://www.wiredtree.com/"&gt;WiredTree&lt;/a&gt;.  I still have a few accounts with my old provider, &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/"&gt;WebHostingBuzz&lt;/a&gt;, but they are being slowly …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one may be a bit long, because I'm going to use it to vent.  =)  I won't make it all "front page news", tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I signed up with a new provider, &lt;a href="http://www.wiredtree.com/"&gt;WiredTree&lt;/a&gt;.  I still have a few accounts with my old provider, &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/"&gt;WebHostingBuzz&lt;/a&gt;, but they are being slowly migrated.  You may already have noticed how much faster the entire linsec.ca site is.  Since Monday night, it's been at WiredTree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I need to explain a few things.  With WHB, I had a shared reseller account which, when I got it, was wonderful.  The server was peppy, things worked extremely well, and for almost a year I was very happy with not having to deal with hardware, colocation, or any of that other nonsense.  I could edit DNS, host as many sites as I wanted, had lots of bandwidth, etc.  Downtime was minimal.  Support tickets were responded to quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's basically gone to shit since then.  About 10mos after I got the account, they took away DNS editing functionality.  Citing a bug in cPanel that was causing named to restart too often on every DNS change, they took it away indicating that it would be back when the bug was fixed upstream.  It's been almost a year.  It's still not back.  Then they took away automatic stats generation (webalizer, awstats, etc.) citing too much load on the machine.  In other words, you would have to log into cPanel and do an awstats update &lt;em&gt;every bloody night&lt;/em&gt; if you wanted good statistics.  Completely bogus, and utterly unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I watched with horror as the server I was on was consistently hitting load averages of over 50.  This week I watched with great fascination as at one point it went over 100.  In my decade of working with Linux, UNIX, and OS X, I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; seen a *NIX system with a load average that high.  Can you say over-sold many times over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing the horrid load averages last week, and being accused of being a contributor to the high load &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; being threatened with account suspension on this very site, I had had enough.  So I went looking and found WiredTree.  These guys are awesome.  Yes, I'm now paying about 8x what I was paying WHB, but I have a Virtuozzo-based VPS with a dedicated 2.4GHz xeon core and a dedicated 1GB RAM.  Ticket response time is in minutes.  I had an issue with FTP that was due to the firewall and 10 minutes later it was fixed, and this was with some back-and-forth, via email.  That fast.  So far, these guys impress me... a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.  Unlike with WHB, I have full DNS editing capabilities.  WHM has so many options available to me compared to the WHM supplied with WHB, I got lost.  I have the latest apache, php, and mysql.  It's running on a more recent CentOS (blech, but whatever).  My awstats run nightly like they're supposed to and, more importantly, without my having to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHB, on the other hand, is going so far down the crapper that if you try to post, as a registered customer, on their &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/forum/"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;, your post is now moderated by default.  You'll notice that this is an unmentioned but added "bonus" to the &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/forum/company-announcements/4041-changes-to-our-community.html#post14559"&gt;recent changes and enhancements to their 'community'&lt;/a&gt;.  (Yeah, I posted a reply to that posting... still waiting for it to be moderated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing that really gets me, and makes me glad most of my sites are moved over and the rest will be moved shortly (despite 6mos of pre-paid time still left on my reseller account) is the &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/forum/support/4028-what-happened-webhostingbuzz-com.html"&gt;blatant lies WHB responds to their customers with&lt;/a&gt;.  So this is a bit of a retelling of my own story with these guys, and a bit of warning to others who may decide to give WebHostingBuzz their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I'm partly to blame here.  I'm a firm believer of "you get what you pay for", and with WHB I basically paid next to nothing for my hosting.  I've gotten a similar return in the service, availability, speed, and support from these jokers.  And, realistically, how hard can you complain when you're only paying about $1/domain/mo?  This is also another reason when I went looking for a new provider I picked WiredTree.  I hadn't found a single negative review, and multiple glowing reviews.  Yes, they are expensive, but I don't want to have to worry about my sites, about my server being over-sold, about ridiculously high loads that slow down my sites, and I certainly don't want to wait hours to get a response to a support ticket I flag urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I want to bring attention to &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/forum/14535-post7.html"&gt;Matt R's blatant lies&lt;/a&gt; about WebHostingBuzz service.  He claims the first three, individual, complainers are "entirely out of proportion", and claims they have tens of thousands of clients, with only a few unhappy ones posting there.  That might be true... what also might be true is that a fair portion of those clients are stuffed like pigs in a basket on the server I'm on.  If you look at the number of servers they seem to have, and the number of clients they claim, they &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be over-selling their servers something fierce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, he goes on to say that the average ticket response time is in "minutes".  That's the blatant lie.  More on that in a moment.  He also claims they have a bigger customer service/tech support team per server ratio than anyone else "he knows" in the business.  I'm not sure how to take that.  He could be telling the truth if he doesn't really know anyone, I suppose.  Or he could be, indeed, telling you the truth but then again, he says nothing about the competence of his staff either (which is often sorely lacking), or the fact that if you ask them five questions in an email, they'll zero in on the easiest one and ignore the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also says the forums are to interact with clients so (we) can provide feedback.  That may have been true at one point, but it's really very difficult for clients to provide feedback if they're being moderated on every post now.  Perhaps not... perhaps they read the feedback and choose to ignore it.  Perhaps they just don't want others to see the feedback they're getting... quite a bit has looked very negative on there lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I tried to post something along these lines in response to that thread but the damn forum logged me out when I tried to post and then my post was discarded.  Posting here is much safer.  Then I made a (much smaller) response, and saw the moderation message.  Gah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to bring a few examples of real-world WHB tech support response time.  Matt claims it is in minutes (and I think he's some sort of head-honcho there... an owner or high level manager anyways).  I assert it is not nearly as good, or as competent, as he claims.  First off, since May 2007 I've had to submit 40 tickets.  That's quite a bit... 2.2 tickets per month, on average.  Granted, some of this is for DNS modification requests since they took that capability away.  Back then, response times seemed pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket VST-645840 opened 05/10/2007 @12:26a, responded to at 12:40a  (nice and fast and as quick as Matt claims... too bad this is a year and a half ago and today's times are nowhere as good)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket GWU-456574 opened 11/08/2008 @7:18p by Oleg, threatening the linsec.ca site with suspension because mediawiki and wordpress were taking too much CPU.  My response at 7:56p to ask for more data, how it was gathered, and what the sampling was like, was responded to 11/11/2008 @11:28a.  Two and a half days later (remember, they wanted &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to do something here, and all I did was ask for information that would aid me in solving the problem).  I responded @3:52p (no rush because, after all, he never answered any of my questions and if he can take 2.5 days to reply, why can't I?).  I also told them they disabled my ssh access which made diagnosing things more difficult too (and, FWIW, top was showing php spikes of loading my pages hit 25% CPU usage, but these spikes lasted 1-2s which doesn't seem to me to be abnormal considering they're forcing us to run PHP5 as a CGI, not a DSO).  Anyways, his response on 11/12/2008 @12:44p (another day later), was to tell me that ssh access was re-enabled.  And &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; Oleg did not answer any of my questions other than to try to upsell me to a VPS or dedicated server plan.  The rest of this ticket is just plain dumb...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket TDV-745991 opened 11/17/2008 @11:01p for an urgent DNS modification (urgent because I needed this in order to start moving my sites to WiredTree).  Andrey responded 20 minutes later to indicate it was done.  This is good response time.  It was also a relatively simple request (although I should note that I've asked for simple things in the past, like DNS changes, that they somehow managed to thoroughly screw up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket LVB-325373 was opened by Oleg 10/16/2008 @6:46a and this time they didn't threaten account suspension, they actually did it.  In all fairness, the site had a misbehaving Drupal so it needed to get fixed and I get that, but...  @2:07p I responded and asked for the account to be unsuspended so I could fix it (these times must be UTC because I'm quite certain this was a first-thing-in-the-morning thing).  I replied again @2:39p.  At 3:35p I was phoning their office because I still didn't have a response.  Thankfully it got fixed via the fellow on the phone because I didn't actually get a response (from Igor), until 12:48p the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket SQA-686130 was opened 10/12/2008 @2:13a to get some DNS modifications done.  It was responded to at 1:45p the same day by Evgeniy.  Not quite the "minutes" Matt is talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go through all 40 tickets I filed with WHB over the last year and a half.  I think, however, that my point stands.  I could see if one of these was abnormal, but we're talking about 12hr turn arounds, next day responses, and even a few days later in some cases.  Certainly not the fast turn around time they're professing to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I highly do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommend WHB if you want any kind of reliable service.  And, food for thought... with similar ping times to both WHB's server and WiredTree's server (i.e. may 2-3ms differences), the linsec.ca frontpage loaded between 2-3s consistently where annvix.org's frontpage loaded in about 8-9s consistently, with one instance where it took a whopping 45s to load.  Guaranteed these slow speeds are due to a) running PHP as a CGI instead of a DSO and b) the high load averages on the server.  Oh, and to make things more interesting, they must have had to force a reboot because today they posted the RAID arrays were re-syncing, but after about 8hrs they had only synced from 20% to 26%... and the load averages still are hitting in the high 30's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line... these guys may be competitively priced (aka cheap) but their service is pretty "cheap" too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>NaNoWriMo is a go this year!</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/nanowrimo-is-a-go-this-year" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-28T20:12:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-10-28T20:12:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-10-28:/blog/nanowrimo-is-a-go-this-year</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, actually, I just found about it this week.

The goal is to write 50k words in one month.. from scratch, starting at 00:01 on Nov 1st with the deadline being 23:59 on Nov 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to do it.  I've been wanting to get back into writing speculative fiction for a few years now but work, wife, kid, Xbox, etc. have all gotten in the way.  =)  Very few people know this about me, but back when I was in highschool I started a fantasy trilogy and wrote 2.5 books in it.  I never did finish it.  I picked up reading it a few months ago and now I think those rejection letters of the happily-optimistic-16-year-old were well justified.  =)  It's not that the writing was awful but dang it... I had enough ideas crammed in there for 20 books and the writing style wasn't the greatest (at least not to begin with but, then again, I started it when I was in grade 9 (so, what, 14 years old?).  The stuff near the end when I was 18 was much much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I have no idea what I'm going to write about other than that it will be fantasy-ish (but I don't like using the term fantasy because that gives ideas of Tolkien and unicorns and furry hobbits, etc. -- what I have rattling around in my skulll is more like mythology than fantasy).  Should be interesting.  No idea what, if anything, will happen with it come the end of November but maybe it'll get these creative juices flowing again.  If nothing else, it'll be fun to try and write something that isn't "technical" in nature.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Canadian do not call list</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/canadian-do-not-call-list" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-01T16:38:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-10-01T16:38:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-10-01:/blog/canadian-do-not-call-list</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Canadian national do not call list is up which basically prevents telemarketers from phoning you, by registering your phone number(s) in the registry.

&lt;p&gt;I'm reading David Allen's Getting Things Done book and this quote really stuck out at me.  Totally true.  I know a few people to whom the latter belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this is a really good book.  I've already gotten some fantastic ideas from it and am already shifting my way of thinking, and I'm only 1/4 through the book.  I've been trying to ascribe to the GTD "methodology" through the use of GTD-related software, but I have yet to turn it into a lifestyle.. so far it's been nothing more than a few bits and pieces here and there, mostly relating to my work with Mandriva which has really had the advantage of keeping me and getting me focused.  Of course the GTD "methodology" could be used everywhere -- from work, other hobby projects, and personal life too.  I'm always looking for ways to be more efficient and by reading this I'm seeing what I've been doing wrong, what I could be doing better, etc.  Really good stuff.  I plan to read it through once then go back with my highlighter once I've got the overall concept so I can really amplify the parts I struggle with and really need to have sink in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, highly recommended.  Even if you think you're efficient now (and you could very well be), there's always remove for improvement and doing things better/faster/easier should be an aspiration for anyone who has less time than they'd like (and who among us can honestly say we have &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; time for everything we want to do?).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="gtd"></category></entry><entry><title>Acceptable web hosting practices?</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/acceptable-web-hosting-practices" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-26T00:08:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-07-26T00:08:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-07-26:/blog/acceptable-web-hosting-practices</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey, just a question for you guys out there.

Don't know how many of you are with a hosting outfit rather than running your own server (be it at home, work, or at a colocation), but I have a bit of an issue here when I reported a problem with my web hosting outfit's exim configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every trouble ticket I've submitted, I've done my due diligence in trying to figure out the problem, provide as much relevant information as possible, and often suggest a fix for the problem.  More often than not I have to go through the same thing 2-3 times because they come back with canned/stock answers and seem to be largely less clueful than the grocery store clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with this wordpress issue from the last post, and having to change my configuration and patch a non-configuration file, the problem is clearly with the hoster and their exim configuration (not allowing locally-generated mail to "relay" via the server).  The problem is that it isn't really a relay if it's coming from the local host.  So what if my MX record points to a different server.  That's not unheard of at all.  So the issue is clearly that exim is doing MX lookups and deciding that the from domain isn't local, so it must be a relay.  That's fine, provided that it's not doing the check on locally-generated mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that's not the big issue.  The response I got from the technical support team told me that some configuration options were not correct in wordpress and that I should check those fields, correct them, and possibly check some others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, those fields have nothing to do with the problem (they belong to wordpress' ability to check for new posts via a POP3 account).  But this individual obviously went snooping through my MySQL database to figure that out.  And he also clearly doesn't know wordpress that well, otherwise he wouldn't have made the idiotic suggestion in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...  do you think web hosting outfits like this have the right to go looking through files and databases as they please?  He never asked if he could look at the database or anything else.  He took it upon himself to go poking wherever he pleased.  Now, I know when I was doing hosting at the colo that I would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; look at a client's files or databases.  The only exception I would make was if there was a suspicion of them doing something that violated the terms of service (i.e. hosting illegal files, etc.).  Otherwise, their stuff is their stuff and I have no more right to it than looking at their email or even their snail mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never experienced this before and, frankly, it makes me uncomfortable.  I don't know if this is "standard practice" for these guys, or if this is an industry thing, and I certainly don't recall reading in their terms of service that they granted themselves the right to poke through my files/data as they pleased.  But maybe this is something that they're allowed to do?  It is their hardware, after all.  But then again, I should have some reasonable expectations of privacy -- to some degree -- right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to go through the hassle of switching hosting providers if the next outfit I go to will pull the same thing, which is why I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>WordPress and bad from address handling for email</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/wordpress-and-bad-from-address-handling-for-email" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-25T14:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-07-25T14:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-07-25:/blog/wordpress-and-bad-from-address-handling-for-email</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there's one thing that irked me about WordPress, which I more or less ignored for months, was the inability to change the "From" address on emails it sent.

It's hard-coded to "wordpress@${sitename}" and when you have some... weird... domain hosters, this can cause problems.  I haven't received comment notification for a few months now as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, in my particular case, is that my hoster is extremely anal about mail relays.  If the from address isn't locally-deliverable, it punts the message with a "relay not permitted".  This is simply foolish, and I've already complained, but I have my doubts they'll change anything.  &lt;sigh&gt;  In my case, the linsec.ca site is hosted at my domain hoster, but the mail for linsec.ca is handled by Google.  So when a message goes out from wordpress@linsec.ca (regardless of whether it's a deliverable address or not, regardless of whether I define an email address on the domain server (that would never really get mail, but I was hoping it would trick exim somewhat)), it gets punted as a relayed address because the MX records for linsec.ca don't point to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could all be extremely easily avoided by letting people change the From address in WordPress.  And it's such a stupidly simple hack.  So when I upgraded to the latest WordPress and found it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; didn't allow it, I finally implemented a quick fix and am putting it here for others who face the same irritation.&lt;/p&gt;

Presumably they would be discussing metal here and by that nature, presumably they're not really looking for "chart" bands because metal wasn't as "mainstream" as it is today (of course, today's definition of metal and all of the available sub-genres make most of today's metal crap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quite amusing to read some of the posts.. people thinking Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, and Def Leppard were mentioned.  Folks... that isn't really metal.  That's hard rock.  The so-called hair metal or "glam metal" of the 80's wasn't real metal.  That was all hard rock.  Just the fact that those bands got air time in the 80's is proof enough they weren't real metal.  The thread is a bit old so I didn't bother posting to it, but it made me think... so here I am listening to some old Venom and I have to say that the best bands (and by best I mean innovative, stuck to their principles and didn't sell out (at least not in the 80's), as well as those that turned around and defined the genre or influenced a lot of later bands) are probably Venom, Slayer, Metallica, and Iron Maiden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, out of those I mentioned, only Maiden got the most "credit".  In the 80's, Maiden had some really great albums.  Albums like Powerslave and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son are remarkable.  I'm surprised Venom didn't get more credit... while I don't really go for all the pro-Satan lyrics, musically these guys were trend-setters.  I get why they didn't really get "mainstream" even in the metal scene then... the music was quite harsh and raw, and the vocals leave a bit to be desired, but that's the whole point.  That sound defined a genre.  Look at bands like Metallica and Slayer who cite Venom as big influences.  And Slayer... well... for thrash metal, they were true pioneers.  Albums like Reign in Blood and South of Heaven were masterpieces in my opinion (although they were mastered too tame.... to really enjoy those songs, you need to listen to the live Decade of Agression which is probably the best live album ever produced).  As for Metallica, despite my less-than-stellar opinion of them now, albums like Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning were amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why anyone would put Bon Jovi and metal in the same sentence is beyond me.  Other decent bands of that decade were Ozzy, Judas Priest, Sepultura, and Anthrax.  Of course, these people prove their cluelessness by including bands like Morbid Angel, Testament and Cannibal Corpse in their list of best 80's bands.  While I don't dispute the fact that a band making their debute in the late 80's should count (which Morbid Angel did), Cannibal Corpse didn't start producing stuff until the 90's.  Ah well... between picking bands from the wrong decade and picking hard rock/glam metal there are quite a few people that probably need their heads examined.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Duty Calls</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/duty-calls" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-18T08:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-06-18T08:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-06-18:/blog/duty-calls</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that people have let me know where that OpenSSL comic came from, I've been looking at &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/"&gt;xkcd.com&lt;/a&gt; more this morning and found one that is utterly priceless and totally reminds me of me.

&lt;p&gt;Industry Canada undertook a music file sharing study during 2006-07 to measure the extent to which music downloads over peer-to-peer file sharing networks, for which the sound recording industry receives no remuneration, affect music purchasing activity in Canada. The data used for this analysis are from a Decima Research survey conducted between April and June, 2006, on behalf of Industry Canada. The report, prepared by University of London researchers, Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz, found that music downloads have a positive effect on music purchases among Canadian downloaders but that there is no effect taken over the entire population aged 15 and over.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't pay much attention to the next-gen hi-def "format wars" beyond the tech specs and features.  I knew that Microsoft was involved with HD-DVD, but I didn't realize the extent.  Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy am I glad that Blu-ray won out.  I actually didn't think they would, considering Sony has had failures with Beta and UMD (well, failures in terms of where they wanted those formats to go).  Seriously, Sony makes a killer gaming system (the PS2 is still incredible, and the PS3 is no shabby piece of hardware either).  But this time they did things right with Blu-ray.  I actually bent and got a PS3 a few months ago, not for any desire or want of Blu-ray, but simply for the games, now that there's some good titles to choose from (Heavenly Sword is freaking amazing!).  I don't think I would have regretted the purchase if HD-DVD won the "war", but the nice thing is now I can watch the winning format without ponying up for another player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, truth be told, when I was looking at standalone blu-ray players, I came to the conclusion that I may just buy another PS3 (probably for Christmas this year I think) to act as the "blu-ray" player of the house.  You certainly get more bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>How to open the Vista box</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/how-to-open-the-vista-box" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-02-02T22:29:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-02-02T22:29:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-02-02:/blog/how-to-open-the-vista-box</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you've ever wondered exactly who it is that Microsoft is catering their operating system, wonder no further.

Don't feel bad if you've had Vista sitting on the shelf, cursing the fact that you've had to use XP because you were too incompetent to figure out how to open the box... YOU ARE NOT ALONE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Microsoft has determined that their users are complete morons, or they have received enough phone questions with the burning question:  Just exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; am I supposed to open this dang box?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, my friends, is a click away on Microsoft's Windows Help and How-to site: &lt;a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/2e680b8d-211e-41c5-a0bf-9ccc6d7e62a21033.mspx"&gt;Opening the Windows Vista box&lt;/a&gt;.

Standard edition is free, but the premier edition is fairly pricy ($50USD per year per email account).  So I signed up for the standard edition for the linsec.ca domain and it seems pretty straightforward.  The only catch is the "mailing list" support seems extremely rudimentary...  i.e. 100% manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone use this domain-management feature in Google?  Does the premier edition handle &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; mailing lists, like mailman or something?  Without the mailing list support, is pretty much useless (sure, I have only one mailing list on linsec.ca, but if I'm going to move to this Google domains thingy, then I'd want to move annvix.org as well to be able to completely "outsource" the remaining email bits I'm running here... and annvix.org handles quite a few mailing lists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don't want to do something like have Google manage linsec.ca, and run the lists on "lists.linsec.ca" or something equally silly, because then there simply isn't any point to using Google at all.&lt;/p&gt;

Today.. drastic difference.  Woke up and the thermometer read -15C and it was blizzard-like conditions... not heavy snow, but a pretty brisk wind.  Currently it's -24C, but with the windchill, it feels like -40C outside.  And it's not supposed to get better anytime soon (at least till Wed is the forecast right now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still snowing, and have been outside to shovel snow about 6 times already today just to keep on top of it.  Sucks when you're outside, exerting yourself, for about 10 minutes and while the rest of you feels ok, your fingertips hurt (and I mean &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt;), and your face is frozen solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's days like today that make me extremely grateful that I work at home.  The roads are crap, I've seen cars up on sidewalks due to the icy roads, etc.  I'm quite glad I don't have to go out in that unless it's an emergency.  I feel sorry for those that do have to (like my wife tomorrow.. sorry hun, Jade and I will stay nice and cozy playing games or something while you're freezing your buns off!)&lt;/p&gt;

I do.  Had to do it a few times...  no longer, but it makes for a nice nostalgic title so let's just go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was my first day "back" after three weeks of holidays.  It was definitely a nice three weeks... went by too fast, as all things do, of course.  Some nice and interesting things happened over the course of those three weeks, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week I spent some time setting up a server to donate to the school my daughter goes to and my wife is the secretary at (Faith Lutheran School).  It's a decent system, AMD64 3200+, 2GB RAM, dual 250GB HDDs in a 3U rack case.  Installed Annvix on it to be a headless backup/subversion system; what it does is mounts a samba share to their Windows domain controller (which is also their file server) and then does daily rsyncs of the data on that share to the local system and then commits those changes to a subversion repository.  Very slick, works well, and is a headless system.  Access is available to it via samba and ViewVC.  The possibility of it doing more in the future is real also (I'm thinking internal wiki, custom MySQL-based mailing database (they still think they want to send my wife on a course to learn MS Access... I'd be laughing very hard if I wasn't the one she'd be pestering with questions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was the first week.  The second and third weeks the girls had off as well, so we were all home and of course that falls with Christmas.  So Christmas Eve we spent at home doing our own thing, spoiling our daughter as usual.  Christmas Day we're at the in-laws with far too many people (my sister-in-law figured it would be nice to invite her boyfriend's daughter and her boyfriend as well), then we have the aunt and uncle also, and a friend from my mother-in-law's work... not to mention the two grandparents, my wife and her two sisters and brother, her sister's sons, and one sister's husband (the other has the aforementioned boyfriend with kids).  All in all, a full house and plenty noisy.  Lots of avoidance and Guitar Hero that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, Boxing Day, we do Christmas at our place for my side of the family, largely because that happens to also by my dad's birthday.  Much quieter (well, much less people... my nephew is one, my daughter is six, and my brother's daughter is 12 so there's a definite range of noise anyways).  Luckily, I have one brother and that's it, so the family size is much smaller.  It was pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week I had planned on "resting"... you know, doing a whole lot of nothing, reading my new Bourne books I got, however on the Thursday after we ended up at the SPCA just going to "check out" the kittens (we've been discussing a new kitten for a few months now as for the last year we've only had one cat (we had 3 cats a few years ago).  Well, my daughter fell in love with one and we brought him home under the mistaken impression he was a quiet cat.  Well, he was quiet for the first day.  Not a peep out of him.  Then he gets comfortable and you can't make the little thing shut up.  Oh well, he's black, he's 4mos old, he's cute, has definite spunk, and is totally attached to my daughter.  So she made a good choice.  My cat, on the other hand (who is 15.5 years old) is still not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, not much else happened.  I did manage to pick up a copy of Rock Band last week Wed or Thurs, can't recall which, but my observations on that are fodder for a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, definitely a nice holiday.  A little disappointing to come back and see the increase of the workload that needs to be dealt with, but such is life.  If nothing else, there's plenty to keep me busy until this stinking cold leaves, and there's not much to do outside other than to shovel snow to distract me, so I should be pretty productive over the next little while, not lacking for anything to do.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Canadian DMCA Introduction Delayed</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/canadian-dmca-introduction-delayed" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-12-10T20:27:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-12-10T20:27:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-12-10:/blog/canadian-dmca-introduction-delayed</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2459/1/"&gt;Michael Geist's blog&lt;/a&gt;, the Canadian DMCA... nonsense... is being delayed.

&lt;p&gt;Good morning.  I'm writing this morning to express my views on this new
proposed copyright law as noted here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071127.WBcyberia20071127170629/WBStory/WBcyberia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely disgusting and I find it insulting that Canadians
should have to follow the mess that America has made of DRM.  May I
remind you that we pay a levy on all recordable media to allow us the
freedom to make backups for personal use?  What happened to the concept
of fair use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was proud to be Canadian knowing that the garbage the RIAA was pulling
in the US would not come north of the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find it ridiculous in the extreme that the Canadian government
would put the concerns of big business (especially &lt;em&gt;foreign&lt;/em&gt; big
business) before the concerns of the Canadian public.  May I remind you
all that the Canadian government is elected by the &lt;em&gt;Canadian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;
and not by corrupt and greedy corporations, particularly those not even
based in this country?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that very little of the levy has actually reached
Canadian artists, if any at all.  That mismanagement of tax should not
be an excuse to ratify some obscene bill to appease greedy corporate
America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, and I know many of my fellow Canadians, appreciate the freedoms we
have as Canadians.  Please think twice before you turn this country into
the same digital-rights-sewer that is currently the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

Dunno if it's the guitars themselves or how it shows on the screen (graphics look kinda sucky, and there's a definite lag and the calibration seems to have made it better but not perfect).&lt;/p&gt;

Either it got pushed forward, or I lucked out and my local Walmart screwed up big because when I was out buying picture frames, I decided to see if Conan (which was supposed to be released today) had come out... lo and behold, I walked out of Walmart with the single copy of Guitar Hero III they had on the shelves.  I presume they had more copies and sold them already, but I don't know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, on medium difficulty I'm ranked 104 of 184... and it was 182 earlier this evening so I'm presuming that more copies either got mistakenly sold a week early or it's already out (but since I didn't see it any other stores I looked at today to get Conan, I think someone let it go early).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should probably be finished it tomorrow... too tired to play more tonight.  Definitely has some cool songs tho.  =)  Guitar Hero II is still selling like crazy tho... on the 18th there were 898243 users on the leaderboards (at which point I was ranked 119207), and as of the 21st, which was the last time I checked the leaderboards, I was ranked 115949 of 908952.  Gotta keep track of these scores somehow and the blog seems like the best place to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I have a receipt to prove I actually did &lt;b&gt;buy&lt;/b&gt; it from Walmart tonight, before anyone starts thinking I downloaded  it or something stupid like that.  Kinda ticked that I didn't walk away with Conan, but I'll take Guitar Hero III... for now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>On Social Networks and Facebook</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/on-social-networks-and-facebook" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-15T19:28:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-15T19:28:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-10-15:/blog/on-social-networks-and-facebook</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been on Facebook for a few weeks now and while I think it's great in that I've gotten to connect with old friends that I've not had contact with for years, I also find it really bizarre.

For instance, with Facebook you can set your status.. a little blurb like "I'm feeling this way" or "I'm tired" or whatever.  I find it really... wierd... that people have statuses like "I feel sick" or "I've been sick all night" and so on.  I mean, really... if you've got a bought of the runs or an upset stomach or something, the last thing I would be doing is hopping on the computer to update my Facebook status to indicate it.  It's like they rush to the toilet then rush back to Facebook to let the world know they've just rushed to the toilet.  It's very bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also interesting to see how much time people invest in Facebook.  For me, it's a communications medium.. I get in contact with some people that I've not talked to in a decade or more, which is pretty neat.  I've found one of my best friends from school on there that I've not talked to in about 8 years, an ex-girlfriend that cheated on me (Lord only knows why she wanted to be added to my friend list, but...).  My point is that for me, Facebook is a great way to talk to people that I've not talked to in a long time or wouldn't necessarily take the time to phone or email (provided I had their number or email address).  But with the number of discussion groups and little applications I see on people's profiles, I can tell they're spending a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of time on Facebook.  I find that odd that people want to spend time sending people "naughty gifts" or "virtual drinks", etc.  Call me wierd but that has absolutely no appeal to me at all.  Yet people have their pages absolutely littered with these useless little apps and keep sending me drinks/gifts/hamsters that, if I accepted, would add the same crap to my profile page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the paranoid security professional that I am, I don't want these third-party apps having blanket access to my personal info (not that I have more than the bare minimum in there anyways).  I wonder if all these people who put their phone numbers, email addresses, etc. realize that by authorizing these 3rd-party apps, they're essentially opening up one more hole to their personal info.  An unscrupulous app writer could easily obtain that info in some way, I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I find the whole social network "phenomenon" both worrying and fascinating.  I worry about the people who don't think about real issues like online privacy, and I'm fascinated with the amount of time they spend on this thing.  Me, I'd rather spend time interacting with real people (like my wife and daughter), playing games, or coding.  I guess that's just the geek in me.  Maybe Facebook needs more geek appeal.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Moved to Wordpress</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/moved-to-wordpress" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-09T12:26:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-09T12:26:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-10-09:/blog/moved-to-wordpress</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've decided to move the blog to wordpress instead of serendipity.

While it encompasses a lot of different things, the first thing I aim to try is to reclaim my email, which has been getting way out of hand lately.  I remember about 2 years ago I did the same thing and it lasted for a bit, but things never last unless you make them habit.  Of course, to make it habit now, I need to fix a few things first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing was to unsubscribe from non-essential mailing lists.  I used to sit on the openssh and exim mailing lists, amongst a few others, just to glean tips and insights and whatnot, with the full intention of implementing some of these ideas.  In fact, my exim mbox has over 150 &lt;em&gt;saved&lt;/em&gt; messages that go back about 3 years... messages I've thought "this would be good to try", etc.  But know what?  In three years, I've barely looked at those messages again, and I've implemented about 2% of the "content" of those saved messages into active implementations on my exim server.  And now that I've out-sourced most of the hosting I do for other people, those things don't apply since my exim server handles mail exclusively for me and some mailing lists I still run.  So do I need to know how to integrate spamassassin with clamav under exim?  Not really.  Do I need to learn more spam tricks?  Again, not really, since I use TMDA as my "guard" for my email accounts on that machine.  In other words, will I ever use those 150 exim messages?  Probably not.  Will I ever look at those mails again?  Even more unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been taking the axe to some old/saved messages and removing myself from mailing lists that I've had a cursory interest in but haven't really been active on.  It's slow going because you need to make a concious decision as to what is important and what isn't.  But the basic idea is to have these folders as empty as possible... even the mailing list ones.  It's not just enough to keep my inbox uncluttered, I want &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my mailboxes uncluttered.  And the less mail I have coming in that isn't important, the less time I spend deleting crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have my email under control again, I'm going to start looking at other areas to increase my productivity and reduce the amount of wasted time.  Time is a finite resource, and I have too little of it as it is... so I need to start making some changes to more effectively utilize my time.  Especially now that my daughter will be in school 5 days a week full-days (grade one, wOOp!) and my wife will be working full-time (as the secretary of the school my daughter goes to), if I discipline myself to get up when they do (and, of course, not go to bed at 1am), then I have a good 8hr window in which to work.  My main goal is to stuff the 10+hrs of work I do every day for Mandriva into those 8 hours.  There should be no external distractions (at least not of the same magnitude anyways), which already gives me a bit of an edge, but if I can squeeze it even more by getting rid of the inconsequential &lt;em&gt;crap&lt;/em&gt; that seems to suck up so much time, then I think I can probably take those 10+hrs and compress them maybe into 6-7hrs and actually give myself some breathing room and get &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea here is the concept that if my wife and kid are gone all day, when they come home I'd like to spend time with them... time with them instead of finishing up this update or that, writing articles for TechRepublic, or doing other work-related things.  A worthy goal, I think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="gtd"></category><category term="email"></category></entry><entry><title>Guitar Hero... more addictive than WoW?</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/guitar-hero-more-addictive-than-wow" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-08-18T08:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-08-18T08:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-08-18:/blog/guitar-hero-more-addictive-than-wow</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been really busy with a few side jobs this week, as well as regular work for Mandriva (playing catchup from a few days in Drumheller (Alberta's dinosaur capital) last week).

However, last week I bought Guitar Hero II with the guitar controller when we got back from our little trip (my nephew had it out at my in-law's and my wife was actually playing it (I looked around to see if hell had frozen over)).  I had given it a try out there, but stunk pretty bad... an amusing game however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... brought it home and really got into it.  Had to move the PS2 out of my office or I'd get no work done with my wife wanting to play it during work hours.  At any rate, I've been spending quite a bit of time on it in the evenings over the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll freely admit that I'm addicted to Guitar Hero like a crack whore is addicted to crack.  I don't think I was ever this stoked over World of Warcraft or EverQuest (back in the day), or really any other game I've yet played.  I think part of it is that it doesn't feel like a game as much as others do... no keyboard, no game controller, just a plastic guitar with buttons and some pretty furious finger work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm getting better... not the greatest yet (but hey, I've only had it for a week now)... I'm managing to pull off five stars on most songs on Easy mode (I've beat all 3 Guitar Hero games on Easy so far, working my way through Medium on Guitar Hero II now).  I've gotten a couple four star ratings on Medium, but I'm mostly hitting three stars.  Although I'm definitely getting better.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not quite like playing a real guitar but close enough that my brother, who can play guitar and bass, picked it up quite quickly last night.  Give him a week with the game and he'd likely be embarrassing the pants off me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that... what could be better than a game that has classic tunes like "Balls to the Wall", "Shout at the Devil", and "Holy Wars" as part of it's line up?  Ok, there's some pretty bad songs on there too, but it's pretty gratifying to be able to say that I can play along with Megadeth... =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Week of hell... domain relocation and moving</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/week-of-hell-domain-relocation-and-moving" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-18T21:25:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-05-18T21:25:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-05-18:/blog/week-of-hell-domain-relocation-and-moving</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the consulting business that I run, I do some web hosting on the side, usually for clients I take from start to finish; those I design/develop the site for and then end up hosting it for them.

I used to do this with a box at a colocation facility close to me and it was reasonably priced, for a modest amount of bandwidth I could use.  Of course, the major advantages were that a) it had a faster pipe than my cable at home (well, DSL when I was running the hosting out of the house), and b) I had root access (and developed the OS) so could tweak things to my heart's content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week I moved all of my clients' sites and a few of my smaller ones to one of those large big-bandwidth-low-cost webhosting outfits.  After all, the majority of "normal" people are going this route and this company has about 10k sites their hosting and the price is pretty good ($25/mo for 400GB data transfer).  The problem is a small amount of space (40GB) and lack of root access.  =)  I've got a reseller account with them, so it's introduced me to things like WHM and cPanel, both of which are pretty decent tools, if you need the point-n-click hand-holding.  Of course, doing shared hosting like this (getting a dedicated server there would cost over $300USD/mo, although I'd get full access to the box and 2TB of bandwidth).  I don't have enough clients to pay $300USD/mo, however (although that is a pretty good deal for the bandwidth; compared to where I was colocating my box, I'd be paying 2-3x that here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the long and short is it was a nightmare.  All of a sudden losing the ability to fix things on your own that you know damn well how to fix and waiting for technical support to do it for you is frustrating beyond words.  For instance, I setup a small mailman mailing list.  I could send mail to it, but it wasn't sending mail out.  Now, if I had root access to the box I could have fixed it in 5 minutes.  Nevermind they're running CentOS which I've never looked at.  I'm familiar with mailman, and I'm familiar with exim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took 2 days for them to fix it with multiple "it's working now" and multiple "like hell it is" interactions.Beyond the problems with mailman, I have no ability to use suhosin (which they've been trying to get enabled for a few days now... works with PHP4 but they can't seem to make it work with PHP5), I don't have access to the MySQL5 databsae server (despite repeated "it should work now"), I had them assign me to a shared IP on the system when I should have had my own dedicated IP (which was a severe PITA to correct since they insisted I needed to move all 27 domains &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; I had configured them.. and then they did it when I was asleep and not when I asked them to), they had spamassassin misconfigured so it didn't put headers in emails, one of my domains had an external MX entry and it was being routed to the local account associated with that domain instead of to the external MX like it should have been)...  the long and short is I was freaking out multiple times this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that most of the clients I have are friends or people I have a good working relationship with (or both).  I'm not so concerned about losing money, but I am concerned about pissing off people that I'm usually on very good terms with and have had exceptional service from me for years.  But, I think, for the most part (other than mysql5 and suhosin, neither of which are absolutely necessary any longer), it's done.  All my clients are there, and my "minor" domains are there too.  For the simple stuff, it works fine (now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I tried to put mediawiki on there last night for the linsec site and had a helluvatime trying to make it work.  In order for me to have it setup the way I want it (with url rewriting, etc.). I need access to httpd.conf.  The problem is, I could probably get them to accomodate those configuration issues for me, but I don't want to wait 2 days to get it, and I don't want to have to tell them 5 times in 5 different ways on how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, linsec.ca and annvix.org are back home with me.  I've got a dyndns account, so things like the MX records for the domains are pointing here and looks to be working just peachy.  The domains are a bit of an issue because cPanel (whether this is bind legalese or not, I don't know) won't let me set "linsec.ca" to a CNAME, it insists it has to be an A record (which I find wierd, but ok).  So I can have the MX pointing directly here, so I should never lose mail, and I'll have to change the IP in cPanel (since they can do the DNS instead of me doing it myself here) if it changes with my ISP which seldom happens, but does on occassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I'm sure I was far more demanding than most of their clients.  I think I had 12 support tickets in the last week.  I admit that I'm a PITA and I guess having an experienced sysadmin as a customer must suck on their end because all of a sudden they need to be held up to a higher standard (i.e. my standard) than they would with just a regular joe who made their website in frontpage or dreamweaver and just needs a place to stick it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value for the money... well, I think it's good enough.  I can't expect everything for that price, and I don't.  I do expect competence, however, and I don't think that's too much to ask.  I'd also like faster support turnaround on issues that should be pretty straightforward.  I mean, really, if you tell me that mysql5 is setup and the accounts I requested are created, I'd expect you to test that before telling me it's working.  This obviously wasn't done because I can't login via the CLI or via phpmyadmin.  A quick 10s test would have &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; indicated that replying to my support ticket with an "it's good" was vastly premature.  That kinda stuff pisses me off.  If you're gonna fix something, &lt;em&gt;verify&lt;/em&gt; it's fixed before you tell the customer it's fixed.  That just plain old makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I won't say who the company is because I don't want to give them a bad name (yet) unless they don't smarten up.  They've been appropriately apologetic, and I've spoken with upper management who indicated they were short staffed last weekend and presumably part of the week, so to be fair I'll give them some time to get stuff fixed.  But seriously, if they haven't managed to get mysql and suhosin working by next monday I'm really going to have to question the amount of time they're giving the ticket, whether they truly want to make the customer happy, or whether they've got a factor of dolts maintaining these machines because neither issue should take more than a few hours at the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; to get working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes venting feels good (although, had I wrote about this earlier this week it probably would have read like something from an N.W.A. song or something).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>No more wow in WoW</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/no-more-wow-in-wow" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-04-26T17:11:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-04-26T17:11:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-04-26:/blog/no-more-wow-in-wow</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've played WoW for about 2 years now... it doesn't do much for me anymore.

Looks like EverQuest on steroids (the original EverQuest, mind you, not EQ2).  Oh well.  I don't think much will be happening with that one beyond the initial 30 days.  Pretty disappointed; it had some concepts that I thought would make a nice change from WoW, but it's barely playable (well, it is playable, but not nearly as fluid/smooth as WoW is and come on, I don't have crappy hardware either so it's pretty irritating).&lt;/p&gt;

It was an extremely interesting read.  So interesting, in fact, that I had to share it just because it astounds me what Microsoft is (or isn't, as the case may be) thinking.  Disclaimer:  I have spent all of 5 minutes in any kind of close proximity to a Vista install, and that was at Staples when I went in for some more blank DVD-R's.  All I can say is it looks pretty, but from a useability standpoint, I have no idea as I pretty much just opened the start menu (honestly, I was more interested in the laptop hardware Vista was running on than Vista itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fellow, Andrew Grygus, makes some interesting points.  I've heard many of the horror stories of Vista, and I've also heard a lot of the PR crap coming out of Redmond, but it becomes more interesting when governments and schools are putting full-out bans on Vista installs and/or are upgrading entire networks to Linux systems instead of taking the plunge to upgrade to Vista.  I also find it interesting that a lot of consumers are sticking with XP and their older hardware, than having to pay for the upgrade to Vista, buy a whole new system and, in many cases, having to buy new hardware that's been certified for Vista because no Vista drivers for their old peripherals are forthcoming, and probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I find it more than interesting.  I find it astounding.  I also find it amazing that with all this negative press on Vista, that hardware manufacturers are allowing Microsoft to bully them into not selling XP anymore, but only selling Vista.  I realize that forcing the upgrades to Vista will, in the end, put more money in Microsoft's pocket, but if no one is interested in Vista and they can't get a computer without it, most people seem to not be buying new hardware (because they can't get XP), which has to be hurting the bottom line for these hardware vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also freaks me out the kind of stuff that Microsoft has put into Vista in terms of DRM and the "modular OS" and the fact that they can do damn near anything they want with &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; computer.  Almost makes it feel like you buy the computer and OS, just to end up renting it from Microsoft anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can honestly say that, despite it's many shortcomings, I didn't mind XP too much (I prefer Windows 2000 to it, and, of course, Linux and OS X to that).  It had many &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; problems, sure, but it still let me use the computer the way I wanted to (more or less) and didn't get all snotty when I did things that maybe Microsoft wouldn't have liked, such as installing Cygwin, etc.  But for them, via the DRM "machine", to potentially lock out applications like Cygwin and others on a whim freaks me out.  I can honestly say that although I still dual-boot XP here, I will never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; use Vista.  And if I can't buy a machine without it, then I won't buy the machine.  Plain and simple.  Microsoft needs a good economical kick in the arse to make them realize that what they're doing is beyond moronic... it's downright morally wrong.  For them to dictate the terms of how I use my own computer is beyond egotistical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, some of you may be snickering right now knowing that I use OS X and it has it's own issues but they are nothing like what Vista is imposing.  The only DRM on Apple (thus far) is iTunes and I have a choice there as to whether I want to buy from the iTunes store or not.  I can still easily rip my own CDs, or download any music from any disreputable source I like, and still be able to use it in iTunes.  Will DRM in Vista now, or in the future, allow the same?  Somehow, I can see Vista's "paperclip" (or demonic imp perhaps) popping up when I insert a legitimate Opeth CD to make mp3's of telling me that if I don't buy it from the Zune Marketplace or whatever they call their iTunes-wannabe, I can't listen to it in my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Linux on the desktop leaves a lot to be desired, but to be honest... I'd rather put up with it's rough edges than Vista's dictatorial crap any day.  Oh, and Apple?  I hope you're paying close attention to the fallout from Vista and be damn sure you never try to pull the same stunts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Main site reorganization</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/main-site-reorganization" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-02-26T22:07:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-02-26T22:07:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-02-26:/blog/main-site-reorganization</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've reorganized my main &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/"&gt;linsec.ca&lt;/a&gt; site a bit.

There really wasn't much of anything overly special on that site and it's largely been neglected so this was a good way to push everything together into one site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I tried to keep some redirects in place for some of the more common articles that were being viewed, so hopefully folks coming from Google and other places won't get lost, and file links that I've posted here (such as the MAMP plist files and the radeon xorg.conf file) will still resolve without tossing out the mediawiki-equivalent of a 404 error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, redoing this was a bit of an eye opener... man my HTML was sloppy.  The conversion from TWiki to static html a few years back did not go well (and yet it goes to show how forgiving some browsers can be since I never noticed a bunch of these problems until my conversion stuff skipped over them due to missing quotes and such). &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Feb 1st... the day to quit smoking</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/feb-1st-the-day-to-quit-smoking" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-01-23T15:47:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-01-23T15:47:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-01-23:/blog/feb-1st-the-day-to-quit-smoking</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Title says it all.

Now throw Palm OS on there and then we're talking.  Sorry, but I've already got an ipod (well, two actually... no... three including the wife's shuffle), so I really don't need another one.  The touchscreen is nice but it's a phone... so not only do you get facial grease on it, but you also get fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And apps?  What apps?  With Apple being very vague on that front, I'd be waiting a year or two to see what materializes.  I don't want a phone that just syncs with iCal/AddressBook (my Treo does that already), nor do I just want a glorified ipod (got three, thanks, the Treo also plays music).  What I really want is what my Treo has now... the ability to look at and edit excel spreadsheets, word documents, play Bejeweled 2, mahjongg, and sudoko, synchronize with my filemaker pro (exceptionally handy!) and do the hundred other things this goofy little phone does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Apple wins hands down on style... the iPhone is very slick looking.  But when it comes to features... will it be as slick as my Treo?  I dunno.  If I leave home without my ipod I don't much care.

My spamassassin/RBL lists/etc. setup was working really well for a long time but now more and more spam is getting through and it's nothing if not pissing me off.  Strange thing is, I get a lot more spam on my Mandriva email than I do on the personal side, but more spam makes it to the folders on the personal side than Mandriva (mind you, with Mandriva's mail I'm using Mail.app with the excellent SpamSieve application which is catching the 10% that Mandriva's servers is letting through).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the personal side, I'm going back to TMDA.  Screw it.  I was using it and had 100% success with it for months... but I was also getting my Mandriva mail forwarded to my personal account, which was causing issues (when you email security_at_mandriva.com you really should have your mail get through and not a challenge-response).  But, now that my personal and Mandriva mails are 100% separate (even to the point of two distinct email clients), it's back to TMDA and the good life on the personal side of my mail.  SpamSieve works awesome with Mail.app and I know TMDA will work awesome on the mutt side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd make SA more aggressive, but I don't want to piss off any clients who might like to get... ahem... certain emails.  So although I have my threshold set quite aggressively, it's not as aggressive as I'd like and I'd have to over-complicate my setup to get per-user SA settings in there.  If I have to go through the complexity, I'd rather do it for something I know is 100% effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for all you anti-TMDA folk out there...  when I was running TMDA, the people who complained the most were the people who didn't know me.  Since my personal email is just that, personal, most people will know me and if they wrote to me then it's important to them I get it, and they will reply to challenge-responses (those few who won't be immediately in my whitelist, that is).  For the rest... I don't particularly care if their mails get through.. what they send me is obviously more important to them than me, so if it's that important, they can deal with the challenge-response.. once.&lt;/p&gt;

That was just about the most fun I've ever had.  First off they put me completely out (and I've never been under anisthetic before) which was... wierd.  I didn't have any real reaction to it like some people I've heard of (or even my daughter when she got put under for some dental work at 2 years old; she came out of screaming and kicking).  So that was ok, but I came out looking like a fat Vincent with a skinny Vincent's body.  My face was probably 2x it's normal size...  it was really swollen.  And they pumped me so full of freezing that it was about 12hrs before the freezing was fully out of my tongue and about 18hrs before my face wasn't frozen at all anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, between a severely swollen face and some pretty good painkillers, I didn't get much done last Wed/Thurs and was able to do some stuff by Friday without falling asleep.  This week has been pretty good, except I think I've developed a sinus infection so I'm on some stronger antibiotics now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting all four wisdom teeth pulled; the two on the bottom were exposed and getting cavities; the two up top were not coming out of the gums, but were quite high up and one of them was even into the sinus cavity (so they ended up doing a graft of some skin from my cheek (the inside, of course) to "plug" the whole they made pulling the tooth out.  Oh, and I actually had two more small teeth growing either on or near the two top wisdom teeth so technically I had six wisdom teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, do to how they are and how the layout of my place is, I can't pull them down easily... either they'll go into power lines or the neighbour's garage.

&lt;p&gt;Instead, for the last two weeks on and off I've been working back there.  Started off trimming about 6-7' in height of the bottom branches so that you can get under there without a face full of pine needles which really opened up the yard.  Since nothing but weeds will ever grow under there, I decided to dump rock under it and Jayden (my daughter) chose this two-inch limestone.  Very nice rock.  Unfortunately, I needed 162 cubic feet to cover it all.  And since a dump truck can't reasonably get back there, I had it dumped in the driveway back there, removed part of the chain link fence, and used a wheelbarrow and a lot of muscle to move all that rock.  I think the results are really good tho and we don't need to get rid of the trees now.  =)&lt;/p&gt;

I own a few hundred fantasy books and buy at least 1-2 books a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One author that I've always found interesting is David Eddings.  He's not the most sophisticated author, but he has some good ideas and spins a pretty good yarn although at times it seems a little juvenile.  Regardless, it's plain old good fun to read.  His Belgariad-based books (Belgariad, Mallorean, Belgarath the Sorcerer, etc.) books are all great.  I've read both the Belgariad and Mallereon (both five-book series) twice.  And his other trilogies, the Elenium and the Tamuli are both really good reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been reading some fairly serious fantasy stuff lately tho...  books by Sarah Ash (the "Tears of Artamon" trilogy is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it!), Terry Goodkind's latest, Steven Erikson's "Malazan Books of the Fallen" series (amazing read!), and R. Scott Bakker's "The Prince of Nothing" trilogy (also a really unique and extremely interesting fantasy trilogy).  Then I started reading Edding's "The Dreamers" series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after 20 pages into "The Elder Gods" I was pretty much ready to toss it out the window or, at least, go to the nearest second-hand bookstore and trade it in (and the other two books in the series that I have).  It wasn't fun or entertaining, it was juvenile and stupid...  gods riding around on lightning bolts without a clue about what's going on, talking like idiots, etc.  Well, I persisted and made it to part two of the book which, thankfully, no longer deals with those idiot gods and deals with good old human beings (and it only took me 53 pages of idiocy to get there).  It's still not nearly up to par with the Belgariad and friends, but it's at least passable.  The last few books I've read I literally devoured... I read the Sarah Ash trilogy in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I read too many really good books lately or is Eddings starting to lose it?  So far I'm really disappointed in this book... and this is a first for any of his books.  If he doesn't manage to pull this one through, it and the next two books in the series are going down the street to trade in for some other used books.  Beware sucky authors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, some really good authors that I recommend are the above noted Sarah Ash, R. Scott Bakker, Steven Erikson (this guy is amazing... has to be one of the best stuff I've ever read).  I'd also recommend two relative newcomers to the genre: Robert Newcomb and David Farland...  Newcomb has the same kind of easy read style as Eddings, but a lot more serious (and gory) and Farland has some really unique ideas... very good stuff.  I'd also recommend anything by Sara Douglas and Terry Goodkind (my wife's favourite), and damn near anything by Margaret Weis &amp;amp; Tracy Hickman (those Dragonlance books rock...

&lt;p&gt;That first week I spent a fair amount of time working on Annvix just because I don't have time otherwise to really get in there and work on it, especially the more time consuming stuff like merging in the Mandriva changes for apache and a few other big packages, so it was good to get some of that stuff done.  That kept me pretty busy for that whole first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, not so much time spent in front of the computer.  Mostly been entertaining my daughter (which is difficult and exhausting if you're not used to it!) because my wife had surgery on Monday and has been pretty much in bed sleeping or unmoving since then (just a day surgery, so she's been home, but she's only really been feeling well since Thurs).  Thank God for grandma's to help entertain the kid and give me a break (oh, and check on the wife as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully next week I'll get some more time to do more interesting things... not necessarily goof off on the computer although I did plan to do up some log monitoring scripts with swatch and socklog, and also play a bit with mod_security.  We'll see how things pan out.  My only plans are to take Jayden swimming at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

That's fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I've been with Bell for about 5 years now... faithful customer, never late, never getting a pirate card to rip them off... I've been a stellar customer.

So, the new guy can get the $10/mo of HD programming waived for a year and the (I think) $15/mo rental fee waived, working out to $300 (and probably with free installation) whereas I have to buy the second arm to upgrade my satellite, string more cable into the house to handle the HD signal, and pay $270 in rental fees for a year on top of that initial cost and effort, just for the pleasure of having been a good customer for 5 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one who thinks this is retarded?  If it wasn't for the time-shifting feature, which my wife claims she can't live without, I'd be getting SHAW's digital TV with the HD support and it would cost me &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; to switch than it does for me to continue being a good customer with a company I've been with for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman who offered me the $30 in waived fees should have just kicked me in the... you know.  It probably would have felt better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Legacies and the power of nostalgia</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/legacies-and-the-power-of-nostalgia" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-04-24T22:27:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-04-24T22:27:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-04-24:/blog/legacies-and-the-power-of-nostalgia</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Legacies are a good thing.

Everyone wants to leave a legacy... in the most basic form it's being a parent to a child who will carry on a physical legacy.  Almost everyone has a legacy, will have a legacy, or is someone else's legacy.  There are, of course, other folks with bigger legacies... the guy who found Canada (no idea who he was, but I'm sure someone in Canada remembers him (or her)), the guy who found electricity (don't know his name either... I'm pretty bad with history).. the first guy on the moon, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, tonight I was reminded of one of my legacies, and one I don't think much of.  I've had a computer since I was a kid... my first machine as an IBM PS/2... a whopping 16MHz, 80MB drive... yeah, some of you old timers had to deal with punch cards but you can't steal the fact that I started off on a pretty tiny machine too (considering my daughter's first machine was an iBook G3, I had it pretty rough).  Well, I got my first modem, got on my first BBS, and was hooked.  Within 6mos I had my own BBS.  Ask my wife sometime how much grief my BBSing gave her when we started dating (I'm sure her loathing of computers originated there... no, the loathing is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the legacy I'm talking about here, but it is one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, back in 1996 I started a fidonet-style network called Sysop's TechNet.  The point of the network was to discuss BBS'ing, to facilitate the expansion of new technologies being used in BBSing with the internet becoming more widely available and accessible, and the sticks in FidoNet were doing nothing but arguing.  Actually, quite a few good ideas came out of STN and I think some of the proposals and work we had done is still being used today, like the reconstruction of the nodelist to accomodate internet/telnet boards.  Anyways, I shut my board down in 2000 when I started working for (then) Mandrake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine my shock to realize that, even today, STN is still alive.  Maybe not thriving like it was in the old days (but no BBS is, either), but it's still alive, still moderately active, and still very much alive.  Something I started almost 10 years ago still has &lt;a href="http://www.sysoptech.net/stn-info.html"&gt;my name&lt;/a&gt; attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this gets a guy thinking.  I logged into my first BBS today in probably 4 years.  And it felt good.  =)  I didn't have any privileges to do much, but dangit... I was on a BBS.  It was old-school.  It felt damn good to be sitting there looking at ANSI art in all it's hideous blocky glory.  I remember the old groups...  iCE, ACiD, and the others... man, those guys were amazing!  The things they could do with colored blocks (digital lego?) was insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now this has me thinking.  And, unfortunately for me (once my wife finds out anyways), I'm actually thinking about setting up a BBS again.  Unlike my old friend Kevin who sparked this with an email today, I'm not gonna setup an OS/2 box to run the old software.  When I shut down my board, I was running &lt;a href="http://www.bbbs.net/"&gt;BBBS&lt;/a&gt; which is perhaps the best BBS software out there and runs on DOS, OS/2, Windows, Linux (intel, SPARC, and alpha), and even FreeBSD.  For kicks a few months ago I dusted off my old backup CD and threw it on a Mandriva box to see if it still worked.  It did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I'm looking at this backup CD again and am seriously contemplating building this thing up from scratch again.  I did email the author of BBBS a few months ago to see if he'd release the source to BBBS... unfortunately, he said no.  Too bad.  I tried to encourage him to compile it for OS X... considering I haven't heard from him, I suspect he hasn't but maybe if I start running this sucker again he might.  I don't need a cocoa interface for it... but I'd love to have BTERM (a special telnet/terminal emulator to connect to BBBS which has better enhancements than a traditional terminal program (or telnet)) run on OS X.  Then I wouldn't have to ssh into a Linux box to use it (and there's squat for good terminal programs for OS X, unfortunately, although I did manage to make xterm behave well enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't just carry on from where I left off... back then I was using Mandrake 6.0 (or so), had a SCSI CD-ROM, a bunch of files available for download through the CD system since I didn't have the space to store all the CDs, and a bunch of networks that may not even exist anymore.  Best thing to do would be to start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amusingly enough, I can still see my work on BBBS still lives on.  If you look at the &lt;a href="http://www.bbbs.net/sysop.html#ABOUT_MANUAL"&gt;About this manual&lt;/a&gt; section of the BBBS docs, you'll see that, once again, I'm involved.  In fact, I wrote docs for a number of software including Nexus (another BBS package), and McMail (a frontend mailer).  I also beta tested &lt;i&gt;tonnes&lt;/i&gt; of different software including BBBS, AllFix, WaterGate, McMail, Oblivion/2, T-Mail, Internet Rex... I know there's more but those are the ones I can remember off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I get back into BBSing to the same extent?  Obviously not.  Things have changed, Mandriva keeps me busy, and "recreation" such as World of Warcraft, Annvix, Oblivion on XBOX360, and last, but totally not least, my wife and kid, make time spent on a BBS probably quite minimal.  But I feel like a guy who played with trains as a kid and then grows up and builds model trains as a hobby.  The nice thing about this hobby is it's completely free now.  My BBBS license is paid.  My internet access is already paid.  I don't have to pay long distance, I don't have to get additional phone lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, really, I don't even care if anyone ever connects to it.  It'd be cool if some folks from back in the day did drop in to say hi, but I can live with being a sole user.  If nothing else, it gives me an outlet that is different from working on Linux, or doing PHP coding, or even playing games.  It'll bring me back to my teenage years.  If nothing else, it'll amuse me.  And the scripting language for BBBS (BZ) is awesome... it'll be interesting to re-learn that stuff again.  Heck... I might even find some of my old BZ programs floating around.  =)  And maybe I'll compile openrexx or whatever the OSS implementation of REXX is since BBBS can run REXX scripts too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah... the more I think about it, the more I think I'll do it.  If it takes me a month to get it setup, who cares?  The fun will be in the journey, not the destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia can be a pretty powerful thing, no?  If it wasn't for nostalgia, I'd probably never do this.  But &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; made me hold onto that CD for the last 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Blog spam</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/blog-spam" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-04-22T18:11:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-04-22T18:11:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-04-22:/blog/blog-spam</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good God...

One of the things I hate doing is Windows maintenance and it seems like there is a lot of that going around.  Inevitably it's the same symptoms leading to the cause...  expired Norton Antivirus protection, lack of a hardware firewall, and the reliance on software like Ad-Aware (which, BTW, I've never used or heard of up until this past Sunday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have a friend's machine here, for which I'm charging to repair, of course, that's doing all kinds of funky things.  I get some kind of sadistic pleasure in re-formatting these drives... but that's dampened by the fact that I have to backup data and figure out a way to get it all back clean.  That already proved an issue with Windows file-locking and the inability to copy files that are in use (how silly is that?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well.. for all you poor Windows suckers out there, may I offer a few words of advice?  A Linksys firewall/router is really cheap... and offers way more protection than some software-based firewall (on Windows, of course).  Buy one.  Please.  Also, if you need a virus scanner, don't let Norton or McAffee gouge you with inferior products... use &lt;a href="http://www.clamwin.net/"&gt;ClamWin&lt;/a&gt; which is a port of ClamAV for Windows.  Not only is it free, but it works.  For spyware, the only recommendation I have is get another OS.  I've never looked at any of those solutions but if Ad-Aware is one of the "best" in that category, my brothers who are slaves to the Windows beast are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and use Firefox and Thunderbird instead of Internet Explorer and Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm off to try to get some of this data back onto his machine and hopefully not lose any of it due to viruses or other malware (am I off my rocker or does ClamWin just report/delete/quarantine files?  I thought virus scanners could clean files too or have they just given up on this?)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Plague of snow</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/plague-of-snow" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-03-18T18:29:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-03-18T18:29:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-03-18:/blog/plague-of-snow</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think if the Egyptians had a plague of snow first instead of water turning into blood, those Israelites would have been let go right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've had about two feet of snow since midnight last night (might have been later but that's when I went to bed and there was no snowing going on).  I've shovelled snow &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; times today.  Heck, almost half my day has been spent shovelling snow.  My back can't take anymore of this... that last one almost laid me flat.  Good thing my wife is in excellent shape... she's been out three times already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year we had something similar, but in April.  Massive snow dump.  I ended up manually shovelling my in-law's driveway to their house on an acreage...  couldn't find keys to the snowblower and the jetta was stuck half-way down the driveway... no choice but to shovel my way out.  That one damn near killed me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, took a few pictures and posted them on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wulfheart"&gt;flickr account&lt;/a&gt;.  Here's a good one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the other pictures, there's one of a table in my backyard.

I think unplugging the usb keyboard did something (the only explanation I can come up with).  Stupid, because when I got back I connected and disconnected it a few times and nothing significant happened, but when I got there the machine was on but I had a completely blank screen.  No idea what was happening, couldn't ping, ssh, etc.  Anyways, rebooted, did some checking, couldn't find anything in the logs so put everything back, watched a bit (via ssh on the other box, I booted without the usb keyboard this time) and then phoned the wife to check on it &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; having put everything back, locked the closet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story... put everything the way you intend to leave it &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; phoning the wife.  Probably would have saved me a trip.  Anyways, seems to have gone pretty good.  A few little things I forgot and a few stupid things I did (FYI, mailman does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; do well when on a partition mounted noexec!).  I think I've got it all now tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll do some benchmarking to see how much of an improvement it is, but I don't think it's going to be crazy significant... the other machine was an Athlon64 3200+ with 512MB RAM.  The HDD bandwidth is better (SATA vs. PATA and I believe the drives are faster too and definitely have a bigger cache).  The big bonus was the form-factor and the removable drives, but I expect performance to be up a bit too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>SunFire x2100</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/sunfire-x2100" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-03-08T21:07:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-03-08T21:07:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-03-08:/blog/sunfire-x2100</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a sweet little machine...  1U opteron 146 (2GHz).

Figuring that it was either at the colo or at the one convenience store I had stopped at on my home, I went out at 1:30am to look for it.  Couldn't find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need my phone... =)  And since I'm already on a contract, I'd be buying a new phone outright.  I like the v710, but it doesn't sync worth crap with my mac.  I can get my calendars from iCal via bluetooth, but no contacts which seems pretty lame.  So my choice became another v710 with the data kit ($399 for the phone and about $50 for the kit), the new motorola RAZR (nice looking phone but after googling has the same problems with syncing that the v710 does (dang Telus for gutting the bluetooth support!!), or getting a Palm Treo which I know will sync because, well, my Tungsten does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the Treo was $449, or about $100 more than the v710, I figured I'd go with it.  I'm so glad I did.  I love this thing!  My Tungsten is nice, but it's old and slow... the Treo is nice and fast.  And I like the fact that I can stick dang near anything on there, and that I don't need to carry around both a phone and a palm.  I've also discovered that &lt;a href="http://www.popcap.com/launchpage.php?theGame=bejeweled2_mac&amp;src=big8"&gt;Bejeweled 2&lt;/a&gt; runs on the palm.. I registered it within hours.  The first Bejeweled was good (I believe you can play it online too), but Bejeweled 2 smokes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the Treo is great.  I'm loving this thing.  I spend too much time playing Bejeweled (perhaps part of the reason I'm not writing here much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the afternoon I bought and activated the Treo, my v710 turned up.  It was in the colo.  I thought I had dropped it at the store and I'd never see it again.

&lt;p&gt;You have no idea how blessed I am.  It's amazing how.... can't say lucky because I don't believe in luck, but it's an apt word since I've used "blessed" already and hate repeating myself... anyways... It's amazing how lucky we've been with this whole incident.  Initially my wife got a ticket because the cops said she was driving too fast for the road conditions (although we know she wasn't).  About two weeks ago we got a letter saying the charges were dismissed (she was going to go to court to fight it) so we didn't have to pay the ticket (about $170), and our insurance didn't go up (in Alberta here, we have this thing called fault insurance... long to explain but suffice it to say, insurance premiums going up is based on whether or not you were at fault).  Well, our insurance was set to renew this month (tomorrow actually) and on notification of our new premiums, they never changed.  So we're not paying extra due to the accident (blessing #2).  Then I get the car today and am told I don't have to pay the deductable ($500); the insurance company said we didn't have to pay it (blessing #3).  Lucky for us, we got a loaner car from the body shop for 2 months so no car rental fees (blessing #4).  Finally, thank God for insurance because the repairs for this car with less than 2400km on it was almost $14,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did this experience cost me?  A helluvalot of patience and a little bit of stress, but as far as money goes... not a dime.  I can honestly say that I feel "blessed and highly favoured".  Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My car is home!!!  (Can you tell I'm excited?!?)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Level 40... finally</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/level-40-finally" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-02-07T08:51:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-02-07T08:51:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-02-07:/blog/level-40-finally</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've been playing WoW for a while now... since the summer of last year.

I finally managed to get my druid up to level 40.  Yeah, you young guys with nothing but homework are laughing at me now since it's taken me so long to hit, but whatever... considering how little time I actually have to play, I think I'm doing pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my played time, I've spent 5 days, 23hrs, 59mins, and 34secs to go from level 1 to level 40.  If I was a single guy with no hobbies, I probably could have done that within a month.  So it's taken me about 6 months (the /played macro doesn't tell me when I actually started, so I'd have to look at credit card statements to find out when I actually started).  So, now I can get a mount!  Yippee!  Unfortunately it costs about 90-100 gold pieces to pay for the mount and training, and right now I have 45g.  So maybe I'll actually get my mount when I hit 42.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Windows innovations and the idiots that believe it</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/windows-innovations-and-the-idiots-that-believe-it" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-01-10T16:34:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-01-10T16:34:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-01-10:/blog/windows-innovations-and-the-idiots-that-believe-it</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find the computer industry, as pertaining to Microsoft "innovation" quite laughable.

But the thing I find most amusing is that people buy this whole "we're Microsoft and we innovate".  I don't think Redmond has come out with an original idea in, well, years.  But people don't see this.  It's funny, this particular comment made on a CNet story talking about AppArmor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.com.com/5208-7355-0.html?forumID=1&amp;threadID=12968&amp;messageID=101898&amp;start=-191"&gt;I'd love to but...&lt;/a&gt; in which an individual who's been programming for 21+ years and says '&lt;i&gt;This emulation mentality means that you are always working on implementing Microsoft's latest offering while Microsoft is working hard on "the next big thing".&lt;/i&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next big thing?  Like what?  Let's take a quick look at Vista and what it has to offer.  Pretty much everything the OS X users have had since Tiger, if not Panther.  But this video a friend sent me speaks louder than what I could say about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.maclive.net/sid/134"&gt;Windows Vista: First of a Kind Features?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.maclive.net/sid/135"&gt;Windows Vista: A Revolution in Information Access?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos are quite informative.  And goes to show just how much Redmond "innovates".  Or, maybe they do innovate and they came up with all these ideas and someone within Microsoft has been leaking all of this to Apple who has the technical skills and expertise to deliver on the idea almost two years before Vistas's projected end-of-2006 release date?&lt;/p&gt;

Insurance, police reports... waiting 4hrs for a tow truck (yeah, yesterday was a great day for accidents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasn't her fault at all... and no big deal.. heck, it's just a car (a nice one, but whatever).  Insurance will cover it, premiums will go up.. life goes on.  Big PITA in dealing with all the "after" stuff tho.  What a timesink yesterday was.  Anyways, pretty much the whole frontend got torn to shreds... the rest of it looks ok so I should know by the end of the week whether or not it's a write-off or not.  Personally, I hope it is... then we can get something new.  I don't know if I'll fully trust a car that's had that much damage to it.  I'll know in a few days I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just glad she's ok... banged her head a bit... sore muscles, a bit shook up... but nothing more serious than that.  The other guys in the truck that she hit are ok to, so that's good... and my daughter wasn't in the car so that's even better.  Really stupid tho... slippery roads, uncontrolled intersection... the idiots in the truck were going much faster than they should have been and even tho my wife stepped on the brakes, she slid right into them (then proceeded to do a 360 (twice) and ended up on the sidewalk... thank God no one was taking their dog for a walk right then).  So even tho my wife got a ticket (they said excessive speed, but they couldn't prove it), we're gonna go to court next month to fight it (I really don't feel like paying a $170 ticket.. nice kick in the ass on top of getting a car with 2382km smashed up).  I figure since her air bags didn't deploy, she couldn't have been going that fast (I read that in the manual... hmmm... I must be a geek... I read a car manual).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.

&lt;p&gt;I mean, you'd have to be an idiot to not know they were selling drugs out of the place, but I had just assumed they were selling marijuana.  I had no idea they were selling crystal meth!

Probably boring for some of you, but highly interesting for me especially when I get to look back and see the things I did.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Annvix server changeover complete</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/annvix-server-changeover-complete" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-05-09T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-05-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-05-09:/blog/annvix-server-changeover-complete</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hopefully no one will have noticed, but earlier this weekend I moved the Annvix (and linsec.ca, mandriva.vmlinuz.ca, and other sites) over to an x86_64 system from an x86 system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a spanky powerful build system now (dual Opteron), I had an extra athlon64 system no longer doing much of anything and while I contemplated turning it into a test system, turning it into a live web server would make it more of a test system than anything else I could do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this site is now running on Annvix 1.0-RELEASE/x86_64 rather than the x86 variant and the changeover was quite smooth. There was very little required to do, and I think I found maybe two bugs to fix before it could be done, which means that the x86_64 port turned out quite well. I'm pleased with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that this changeover is complete, I hope to have more time working on the baseline changes of Annvix (namely redoing and changing some of the SSP bits between glibc and gcc). Once that's done, time for a big recompile. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase one is complete.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>linsec.ca changeover complete</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/linsecca-changeover-complete" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-03-26T22:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-03-26T22:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-03-26:/blog/linsecca-changeover-complete</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spammers irritate the heck out of me.

And due to the open nature of TWiki, they've begun to take advantage of it and start including little hidden spam links on the site. I'm sorry to generalize, but every one of these spammers have been Chinese. It's very very annoying. They've been doing this with the &lt;a href="http://mandrake.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;Mandrake Community Wiki&lt;/a&gt; which I also host, but that site is really large and has quite a number of contributors. The good (or bad, depending on how you look at it) thing about not having really any contributors to linsec.ca is that I can arbitrarily change the format of my site without worrying about it affecting anyone other than those who have pages bookmarked... for that I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the transition is done and all of the pages are finally over into the new "semi-static" format. The content is the same although I did try to clean up a few things... but I may have also left a mess from the TWiki conversion. Hopefully if anyone notices any of these artifacts, they'll let me know so I can clean them up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added the djbdns and qmail articles that I wrote and that were on the (now defunct) MandrakeSecure website in the past. They're dated, but then again, the software itself hasn't had updates in ages so I guess the info is still relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one doc that I want to carry forward from the old site called "Introduction to msec" but I need to sit down and re-work it so that it's still valid as I originally wrote the old article for Mandrakelinux 8.2. I'll need to update it for 10.2 (sorry, Limited Edition 2005) one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next big "project" is to setup a Kerberos5 system on my local LAN and although I wrote a two-part series for TechRepublic over 4 years ago, I think I can do better than to just re-type the old docs (which were a little brief due to size constraints). I think that should make for an interesting article, and then an article to tie both Kerberos5 and LDAP together should be interesting as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, documenting OS X as a client for a LDAP-based authentication system (which I haven't gotten to work yet), and including Kerberos (which, by the sounds of things, may be the easier part), will really make for an interesting set of articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I'm open to suggestions for new articles. I'm also really open to donations if you do have a suggestion... =) Considering the huge (relatively speaking) number of hits some of these articles have had, I'm actually amazed that someone hasn't thrown a few bucks my way but oh well... I've become used to it (if anyone knows about the &lt;a href="http://anthill.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;Anthill&lt;/a&gt; project they'll know what I mean). At any rate, if you do have something you'd like to see me cover, I'd really like to see you pony up for it (after all, I'd be writing about something interesting to you, not necessarily interesting to me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I do book reviews! Send me a book, I'll read it and review it. All I want out of the deal is to keep the book (which is a great deal for me for good books, not such a good deal for crappy ones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, hopefully I'll be able to squeeze a little extra time into documenting different things, although I think from this point forward they will be taking a decidedly Annvix slant unless it's on some software that Annvix doesn't ship (at which point it will be based on Mandrakelinux). Of course, if it's something applicable to both, then I'll note both (primarily because Annvix is service-based and Mandrakelinux is initscripts-based).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>linsec.ca Changes</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/linsecca-changes" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-03-21T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-03-21T12:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-03-21:/blog/linsecca-changes</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The linsec.ca site has had a few changes and this is due primarily to the fact that chinese spammers are abusing the wiki.

So, in the interests of keeping my sanity, I've decided to make all the articles on linsec.ca static meaning no more wiki.... This may make for a bit of a nuisance for some people as they've bookmarked the wiki links, but oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time I've decided to make a blog... it's the latest "thing" after all. Here I can discuss things related to things that I do, be it hobbies, computer-related stuff (Annvix, linsec.ca, etc.). Don't expect any Mandrake-related ranting, however... unlike some people, I'm smart enough to vent in private and keep my mouth shut in public. I do want to keep my job, after all.. =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, there will be a transitional period for linsec as I pull out all of the wiki content and reformat it to work with the new static pages so some articles may be unavailable until I get around to doing it all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry></feed>
