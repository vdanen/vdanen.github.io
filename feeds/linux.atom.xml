&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to attend Red Hat Summit 2023 which you can &lt;a href="https://reg.experiences.redhat.com/flow/redhat/sum23/regVirtual/login"&gt;watch on demand&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, MA.

&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to attend Red Hat Summit 2023 which you can &lt;a href="https://reg.experiences.redhat.com/flow/redhat/sum23/regVirtual/login"&gt;watch on demand&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, MA.  Unlike the OSS Summit, this was a 14h door-to-door trip, there and back, due to delays (typically 12h door-to-door).  However the annoyance in travel was more than made up for by the energy of the Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was probably the best Red Hat Summit I've attended.  Unlike last year that was more executive-focued and smaller, this one was a lot bigger, a lot busier, and was absolutely buzzing!  After COVID and so many years or not having an in-person Summit, everyone was happy to be there, energized, talking, and excited.  Beyond that, the product announcements this year were really exciting, things like: Ansible Lightspeed, Trusted Application Platform, Developer Hub and Services Interconnect to name a few.  You can get the lowdown of all the announcements from the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/red-hat-summit-newsroom"&gt;Red Hat Summit 2023 Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; which has a bunch of links to different announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first Summit where I was on the keynote stage giving a quick demo about Red Hat Trusted Application Platform with my friend, and overly experienced presenter, Burr Sutter.  It was gratifying to hear later how well received this demo was!  You can &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0LCmCkwRcOE?t=3565"&gt;watch our demo on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; starting at 59:25 which has Ashesh's preamble and setup first then the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there I was again invited to be on theCube and talked about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvpmNeFvDo8"&gt;Trusted Application Pipeline, supply chain security, open source security, SBOMs and more&lt;/a&gt;.  (Try to ignore the clicking, I'm going to have to get them to mic me up on the side where I have less earrings in the future!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also great to connect with Red Hatters I've never met in person or those I've not been able to meet for some time (and those I was hanging with at the OSS Summit two weeks prior!).  It was an excellent event, very busy, very exhausting, but at the same time very energizing as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="redhat"></category></entry><entry><title>OSS Summit 2023</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/oss-summit-2023" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-13T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-08-20T08:15:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2023-05-13:/blog/oss-summit-2023</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/LF-Event-Logo-_OSS-NA-V-White-01-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Probably the easiest conference I've ever attended, travel-wise, as it was about three hours door-to-door.  Contrast that to Red Hat Summit in Boston, which is about 12 hours door-to-door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to attend the &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/"&gt;OSS Summit 2023&lt;/a&gt; in Vancouver, BC.  Probably the easiest conference I've ever attended, travel-wise, as it was about three hours door-to-door.  Contrast that to Red Hat Summit in Boston, which is about 12 hours door-to-door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was great, I believe there were about 2,000 people in person.  It was awesome to catch up with some folks I've not seen in a while (even ran into someone from SUSE who worked at Mandriva when I did; last time we met had to be around 16 years ago in Paris!).  Unfortunately I didn't get to attend too many talks, although I did attend a few at the OpenSSF day.  My schedule was too busy and I was too busy talking with customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a few other obligations.  I gave Red Hat's keynote, which is typically given by Chris Wright, Red Hat's CTO, but he was in Europe for something else and couldn't make it.  While not my first keynote ever, it was the largest stage thus far.  Presumably it was well-received given some of the feedback I've gotten and you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cgU6M0oXMQ"&gt;watch the keynote here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMMBNLoEn5Y"&gt;interview with theCube&lt;/a&gt; which was great.  We talked about security and open source (what else?!) and it was a lot of fun.  A great conversation, thanks for having me on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was on the &lt;a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2023/07/05/trusted-software-supply-chain/"&gt;Software Engineering Daily
podcast&lt;/a&gt;
talking about all kinds of things from secure software, secure supply
chain, to open source in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a great week and it was good to catch up with and reconnect with some folks I've not seen in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

topics over the last few weeks that have been published.  The most recent
is a blog post I co-authored with Tracy Ragan at
&lt;a href="https://www.deployhub.com/"&gt;DeployHub&lt;/a&gt; entitled &lt;a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2023/04/06/sboms-so-far-so-good-so-what/"&gt;SBOMs, So Far, So Good,
So
What?&lt;/a&gt;
where we take a look at the concerning trend of everyone talking about what
a good SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) should be, but very little on how
to consume it, or what you do once you've got it.  Actually, I was
discussing the topic with my wife and, amusingly, we had watched Conan the
Destroyer a few weeks ago and she said: "Grab it, and take it!" to which I
responded: "Once you've got it, what do you do with it?" -- I didn't think
that was the most appropriate way to title the blog post though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who've never seen Conan the Destroyer, here's a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPkhh5JytYE"&gt;clip of the
scene&lt;/a&gt; although it doesn't
have her followup of "once you've got him, what do you do with him?" 🤣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I was featured in the latest Red Hat Security Detail
episode, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSyEGkX6sX0"&gt;CVE and CVSS explained | Security
Detail&lt;/a&gt; that I had gone to
Raleigh, NC last year to film.  I thought it turned out pretty well, and is
me (again) talking about a risk-based approach to vulnerability management
vs the old-school (and ineffective) check-box-based security.  There's a
companion article entitled &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security/what-is-cve?sc_cid=7013a0000034s1WAAQ"&gt;What is a
CVE?&lt;/a&gt;
to go along with the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had a co-worker who is from Eastern Canada who was in town for a
day and he has this thing on LinkedIn called "Todd Talks" so we did two
videos for that.  The first is again talking about vulnerability management
in my kitchen: &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7043935762429403136/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;Todd Talks security
1&lt;/a&gt;
and the second &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7046704024363921408/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;Todd Talks security
2&lt;/a&gt;
where we talk about risk profiles and vulnerability scoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't things I would necessarily be comfortable doing in the past,
but I'm leaning into them because there's some really good messaging that
needs to go out.  So hopefully these inspire some new thinking about how we
fix vulnerabilities, and when, while also keeping the conversation going.
When I talk to customers 1:1 and explain this, they understand... fixing
all vulnerabilities isn't scalable or effective, and the numbers bear that
out (see the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/product-security-risk-report-2022"&gt;2022 Product Security Risk
Report&lt;/a&gt;
particularly when it comes to known exploitation).  We could spend a lot of
time fixing things that don't matter, or we can spend time fixing what
truly matters, responding quickly when it starts to matter, and focus
engineering and operational effort on things that actually provide value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to talk about there, and a lot of old-school thinking that
needs to be changed.  Let the conversation continue!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Joplin server on TrueNAS Scale</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/joplin-server-on-truenas-scale" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-05T16:42:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-03-05T16:42:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2023-03-05:/blog/joplin-server-on-truenas-scale</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm an avid note taker and have migrated through a series of different

tools to take notes, some proprietary and some open source.  I've gone
through Quiver, Inkdrop, Agenda, and recently I migrated everything to
Joplin.  But I wanted to be able to sync my notes between devices and I
didn't want it anywhere accessible to the public.  Since I run TrueNAS
Scale at home, and there's a TrueCharts application for the beta Joplin
Server... I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked great and I've been syncing the Joplin client on my desktop to
the TrueNAS-based Joplin Server for some time but not without HTTPS, which
wasn't really an issue since it was only available in my home network and
the notes are encrypted, but I was having issues trying to get Joplin on my
iPad to work and from what I'd read, having it sync over HTTPS rather than
HTTP was the way to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a bit of time and effort, had to change the TrueNAS Scale system from
being a single-IP via DHCP to a static IP with an alias, to bind all the
kubernetes applications to the second IP address, setting up another
wildcard Let's Encrypt certificate to work with Traefik (which I also
installed as an application).  Now I can connect to Joplin Server and my
PiHole application via HTTPS on their own dedicated subdomain.  It's
actually quite slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main reason for noting this here is because I have a terrible memory
(hence the long journey through a number of note-taking applications!) and
I wanted to reference this YouTub video: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSMgfz5zrxo"&gt;Secure HTTPS for all your TrueNAS Scale Apps (traefik)&lt;/a&gt;
which was an amazing help and got me through the setup pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find some of the application configuration to be quite overwhelming, so
noting here the most important pieces to remember when configuring an
application to use Traefik in your applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;Networking and Services&lt;/strong&gt; you want to set the "Service Type" to
&lt;code&gt;ClusterIP (Do Not Expose Ports)&lt;/code&gt; because Traefik is your ingress
service, so only expose the application to the internal kubernetes network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;Ingress&lt;/strong&gt; you want to tick &lt;code&gt;Enable Ingress&lt;/code&gt; under the "Main
Ingress" section.  You'll need to add a Host and give it a HostName to
reach the application on (i.e. &lt;code&gt;joplin.subdomain.mynetwork.com&lt;/code&gt; or
whatever (in this example I'd have a Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate for
&lt;code&gt;*.subdomain.mynetwork.com&lt;/code&gt;.  You need to add a Path but it will
typically just be &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;TLS Settings&lt;/strong&gt; you want to add a Certificate Host which will have the
same hostname as your main ingress host above
(joplin.subdomain.mynetwork.com).  In the "Use TrueNAS SCALE Certificate
(Deprecated)" you want to select your wildcard Let's Encrypt certifcate.
Not sure why it's labelled "depricated" because it works (maybe it goes
away in the future?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest can pretty much be left alone.  So even though Joplin Server
listens to port 22300, doing the above you can connect on port 443 of the
wildcard domain, using HTTPS, and synchronize just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obnoxiously, the iPad client is throwing a different error now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Last error: Error: Error 404 Not Found: Invalid origin:
http://joplin.subdomain.mynetwork.com:443
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This error makes no sense as I have the Joplin Server URL in the iPad
client set to https://, not http:// ... so something to figure out later I
suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I didn't get it precisely where I wanted it, but now it has
full end-to-end encryption and I can configure PiHole over TLS which always
makes me happier.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="truenas"></category></entry><entry><title>OpenSSF spotlight</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/openssf-spotlight" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-15T11:55:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-02-15T11:55:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2023-02-15:/blog/openssf-spotlight</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I had the opportunity to be interviewed as a member of the OpenSSF

governing board.  In fact, I'm not sure I mentioned this here before...
I've been an observer on the board for all of 2022 and at the beginning of
2023 I joined the governing board as a member to represent Red Hat and bring my own
extensive experience in open source software, and security, to the table.
The interview "&lt;a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2023/02/14/spotlight-on-openssf-board-member-vincent-danen-vice-president-of-product-security-red-hat/"&gt;Spotlight on OpenSSF Board Member: Vincent Danen, Vice President of Product
Security, Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;"
was a lot of fun to do and hopefully interesting to people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, you can't do this kind of work without tying it to
something that you value.  For me that's people.  Sure, the model of open
source is interesting and awesome, the software produced is amazing, but I
think where a lot of folks suffer from short-sightedness is the focus on
the software itself, not what you can actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with it and the impact
it has on society.  How we have leapt forward so quickly with technology is
parallels how society has evolved from a humanitarian perspective (and I'd
really like to separate that from a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;idealogical&lt;/em&gt;
perspective because I'm not convinced we've progressed in those areas, to
be honest... but that's a topic for another day!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, hope you find the interview interesting.  Would be keen to get
some thoughts on it -- do you feel the same?  Different?  Sadly no comments

&lt;p&gt;This is my first article written there and while the article itself tends to be vendor-agnostic, this truly is an article about Red Hat Product Security team's use of tooling for vulnerability management and the evolution of the same.  We went from no tools, to commandline tools that manipulated Bugzilla, to a monolithic web-based tool (that also manipulated Bugzilla) to a suite of discrete tools to handle vulnerability management with a proper database and proper front-end tools.  The reliance on Bugzilla was historical and we're really looking forward to getting rid of it as our "database" because it never should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you iterate and learn, and the thing I'm most excited about is these tools are now being developed in the open and can benefit others, which none of the earlier tools with their reliance on our modified Bugzilla could do.  So if you're interested in vulnerability response tooling, I'd encourage you to read the above article, checkout the linked github repos (noted below for convenience) and see if there is something you can use or contribute to! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/component-registry"&gt;Component Registry&lt;/a&gt;: which is used to store all of the component information across any number of products and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/osidb"&gt;OSIDB&lt;/a&gt;: the Open Security Issue Database, is the database to store all vulnerability data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/openlcs"&gt;OpenLCS&lt;/a&gt;: the Open License and Crypto Scanner, is the tool to obtain license and cryptography information from shipped components&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of this year I've been advocating for a risk-based vulnerability management approach, rather than the "industry standard" checkbox-based approach.  I've been talking to customers, both directly and at various events (such as Red Hat Summit in Boston, Red Hat Summit Connect in Dallas, directly with customers in Singapore …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/cves-on-fire.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For much of this year I've been advocating for a risk-based vulnerability management approach, rather than the "industry standard" checkbox-based approach.  I've been talking to customers, both directly and at various events (such as Red Hat Summit in Boston, Red Hat Summit Connect in Dallas, directly with customers in Singapore, and virtually with customers).  A few weeks ago I also published on the Red Hat Security blog: &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/do-all-vulnerabilities-really-matter"&gt;Do all vulnerabilities really matter?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gratifying thing is that I'm not alone!  Earlier this week I saw this article: &lt;a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/why-cve-management-as-a-primary-strategy-doesn-t-work"&gt;Why CVE Management as a Primary Strategy Doesn't Work&lt;/a&gt; which nicely dovetails with what I've been talking about, and a few months ago there was &lt;a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/open-source-software-bugs--attackability"&gt;Only 3% of Open Source Software Bugs Are Actually Attackable, Researchers Say&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given there is such a low exploitation rate, and also given there is such a high vulnerability rate that continues to grow YoY, one has to step back and ask oneself: do all of these matter?  Do we need to update all of them?  The answer is, generally, "no" yet it's a little more nuanced.  Sometimes it's hard to know which vulnerabilities will turn into something that we care about.  Yet there are some metrics we can look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/product-security-risk-report-detail#section-5"&gt;2021 Red Hat Product Security Risk Report&lt;/a&gt; we started reporting on known exploits and the data was enlightening.  For example, there was a 10% exploitation rate of Critical-rated vulnerabilities, a 2.5% exploitation rate of Important-rated vulnerabilities, and the numbers kept dropping... 1.7% for Moderate-rated and 0% for Low-rated.  Now, as time goes on those may edge a bit higher for Critical and Important vulnerabilities -- after all, we know that there are ancient vulnerabilities that are exploited years after they're made public (which is why patching these things is so critical!).  But few are exploited immediately.  So if we focus on those most likely to be exploited, and where a successful exploit would have the most damaging impact, focusing on fast fixing (and patching!) of Critical and Important (or High, as some call them) vulnerabilities makes the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's a really tiny number, overall.  Again, using the 2021 Red Hat Product Security Risk Report, there were 293 Critical and Important vulnerabilities, versus 1303 vulnerabilities rated Moderate and Low.  Fixing and patching 293 is a lot easier, for both producer and consumer, than fixing all 1596.  And these are just vulnerabilities that affect a shipping Red Hat product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do a bit of correlation here with data available from NVD.  Unfortunately I wanted to use the allitems.csv from MITRE to import into SQLite but it seems... well, it seems that the CSV file likes to have differing numbers of columns which breaks an easy import.  Hopefully future APIs will help, or the JSON format files like NVD does.  The APIs available from NVD won't help get these statistics either so I downloaded each of the JSON files.  And then because I don't get to nerd out and write much python these days, I created &lt;a href="https://github.com/vdanen/nvd-cve"&gt;nvd-cve on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; which will let me play around with some of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing to recognize is that, as per the NVD data, there has been steady growth in CVEs the last few years (big surprise!).  2021 had 10% YoY growth with a total of 20078 CVEs and thus far in 2022 we're at greater than 8% YoY with a total of 21733 CVEs published on NVD to-date.  That's a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of CVEs to fix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendors can try to keep up, at considerable expense in terms of time and energy.  That's a lot of patches to produce, and the picture is incomplete.  For example, this probably under-represents the number of vulnerabilities in open source because a lot of projects don't bother with getting CVEs assigned or don't know they fixed a security issue.  We know this &lt;strong&gt;vastly&lt;/strong&gt; under-represents proprietary software because they often don't bother labeling Low or Moderate (Medium) vulnerabilities as vulnerabilities and will either fix them silently or ignore them.  Having talked with a number of proprietary PSIRTs, I know this for fact.  And why not?  It's not as though anyone will find out, for the most part.  The beautiful transparency of open source allows for everything to be shown -- warts and all.  We can't hide it and we don't want to hide it, which is great news for consumers.  If a vendor doesn't apply a fix, but you know there's a vulnerability and it concerns you, you have the option to mitigate.  As they say, knowledge is power!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately with proprietary software, you don't have this knowledge and so don't have the power to mitigate on your own.  That's a benefit of open source, even though sometimes it makes things look uglier.  You can assess the risk in what you know -- it's not possible to assess the risk in what you don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave us?  Well, I've been working with open source for over 20 years so I'm obviously biased towards it.  With open source, you're not going to get all the fixes.  And honestly, you don't &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; all the fixes.  It's too expensive to test and patch for every single vulnerability discovered.  With that number going up, the cost will go up too.  Most people didn't start using open source to patch all the things... they got into open source because it provided value and increased the speed to delivery of whatever it is they're building &lt;strong&gt;on top of&lt;/strong&gt; that open source.  Yet, even though you won't get all the fixes, you do get all the information, and can mitigate on your own if you feel so inclined.  That's a benefit you don't get with proprietary software and one we shouldn't quickly forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet at the end of the day, no one wants to deal with CVE lists in the thousands where most of those vulnerabilities don't matter and honestly, whether you care to admit it or not, a lot of vulnerabilities out there aren't even on your little (or big!) list.  So why not do the sensible thing, set the list aside, and focus on the &lt;strong&gt;risk&lt;/strong&gt; of these vulnerabilities.  Critical and Important issues are most likely to be exploited, so concentrate there.  If a Moderate issue does get exploited (the risk of which is quite low and the risk of it causing significant damage even lower) then look to the vendor for a fix.  Typically they'll do the right thing and provide the fix without you having to ask.  That's because most vendors truly do want to protect their customers yet, at the end of the day, the software you're using isn't being used because it has no known vulnerabilities... it's being used to create value for you as a customer, and most likely your own customers further downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be clear, I do work for a software vendor and while the thoughts above are my own, they align with our approach.  We focus on the risky software that could potentially pose a threat to our customers.  You may also be interested in reading &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerability-management"&gt;An Open Approach to Vulnerability Management&lt;/a&gt; which we updated a month or so ago with more information on exploitable vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I took my first shake at some home-grown photo manipulation for fun.  The explosion came from &lt;a href="https://www.freepnglogos.com/pics/explosion"&gt;freepnglogos.com&lt;/a&gt; and the CVE screenshot is from the NVD site.  It's not really a checklist of CVEs to fix but you should get the drift... I really would enjoy watching those lists burn ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Controlling software supply chain security will require new tools, automation and vigilance</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/controlling-software-supply-chain-security-will-require-new-tools-automation-and-vigilance" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-18T16:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-02-18T16:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2022-02-18:/blog/controlling-software-supply-chain-security-will-require-new-tools-automation-and-vigilance</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/redhat.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's an article that talks about supply chain risk and associated costs -- after all, no software is truly "free" (which is why we prefer the term open source to free software).  So where is that cost paid?  The article explores that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTUSCXNUvVE"&gt;video interview on open source and security&lt;/a&gt; I did with the fine folks at RedMonk last December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to use my "water treatment facility" analogy that I've been using internally at Red Hat for nearly a year now about what a supply chain looks like and the parallels between what we do for software being akin to what a water treatment facility does for, well, water.  The similarities are striking and ironic, given a few weeks after starting to use the analogy, the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/10/us/florida-water-poison-cyber/index.html"&gt;Florida water treatment hack&lt;/a&gt; was a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

With the explosion of security scanning vendors, particularly around containers, the reliance and misunderstanding of CVSS has been a thorn in my side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't often blog about challenges at work or in the security industry, but I had considered writing about CVSS and some deficiencies around it (I may yet still do so).  When Jack reached out to Red Hat to be interviewed, I jumped at the opportunity because it's an important topic and because I could trust Jack not to twist or sensationalize what I had to say.  =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had a Unifi Security Gateway for over a year now but never had the time or patience to make it work properly.  Turns out my ISP &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; likes to cache MAC addresses so getting the USG to present the pfSense MAC address solved the problem pretty quick.

&lt;p&gt;I've had a Unifi Security Gateway for over a year now but never had the time or patience to make it work properly.  Turns out my ISP &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; likes to cache MAC addresses so getting the USG to present the pfSense MAC address solved the problem pretty quick.  The rest of my gear is all Unifi (48 port switch, 3 APs, Cloud Key Gen 2, 4 video cameras) and I love it.  Probably the most reliable network gear I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of the USG is a bit of a PITA though and finding information is hard because they have &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; networking gear out there and it seems they're all configured in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will share the two important things I needed: first, how to change the MAC address for the WAN1 port and secondly, restoring similar behaviour to pfSense's pfBlockerNG utility which blocks all ad-serving systems by replacing their IP address with 0.0.0.0.  Reading a page on macworld.com this morning on my phone made me really sad because of all the ads.  I do some surfing outside my home network, rarely... mostly I notice that the weather network app has ads when I'm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; home that aren't present when I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; home.  But loading that page this morning was an intolerable regression from what I'm accustomed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Custom MAC address&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I needed to do to get my USG to even talk to the internet and this is what stumped me the few times I had tried before.  I probably would have figured it out sooner if I'd had more time and/or patience.  At any rate, you need to create a &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/unifi/data/sites/default/config.gateway.json&lt;/code&gt; file with contents similar to the following (assuming you're using the Cloud Key; if you run the controller software on a different system you'll have to find the right spot):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    &amp;quot;interfaces&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;ethernet&amp;quot;: {
            &amp;quot;eth2&amp;quot;: {
                &amp;quot;mac&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;00:00:00:00:00:00&amp;quot;
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change that MAC address to whatever you need it to be.  Depending on the port, &lt;code&gt;eth2&lt;/code&gt; may not be correct.  On my USG 4 Pro, eth2 is the WAN1 port which is what is connected to my cable modem.  eth0 is LAN1.  Note that this &lt;code&gt;config.gateway.json&lt;/code&gt; file goes on the Cloud Key and once there you need to force-provision the USG and it will get copied over to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ssh into the USG and double-check by grepping for that interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@ubnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;eth2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;inet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;brd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;255.255.255.255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;eth2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it shows your external IP (1.1.1.1 in the above) and the right MAC address (00:00:00:00:00:00 in the above) then you're good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;pfBlockerNG-like ad blocking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is easy enough and the credit comes from this article: &lt;a href="https://medium.com/server-guides/how-to-integrate-ad-blocking-using-a-unifi-usg-a165dc2233c1"&gt;How to integrate ad blocking using a Unifi USG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the instructions from there, but the &lt;code&gt;update-adblock-dnsmasq.sh&lt;/code&gt; script I'll include below has been updated to suit me better.   For one, it's using an old URL for the block list.  Secondly, I don't like the idea of calling out to the internet with curl as root so I changed that.  Finally, I also made sure it validates the dnsmasq configuration before it restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# original writeup: https://medium.com/server-guides/how-to-integrate-ad-blocking-using-a-unifi-usg-a165dc2233c1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# note this script needs to run as root, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean everything&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# has to run as root&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;whoami&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; !&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Script must be run as root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; -f &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;temp_ad_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    sed -i -e &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/googleadservices\.com/d&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;temp_ad_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    chmod &lt;span class="m"&gt;644&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ad_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Error building the ad list, please try again.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;

rm -f &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;temp_ad_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# before restarting, test the validation so we can remove the ad file if&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# it&amp;#39;s going to cause problems&lt;/span&gt;

    /etc/init.d/dnsmasq force-reload
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    rm -f &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ad_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Removing ad configuration due to validation errors&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the article notes, this should be placed in &lt;code&gt;/config/user-data/&lt;/code&gt; where you can run it the first time using &lt;code&gt;sudo sh -x update-adblock-dnsmasq.sh&lt;/code&gt; so you can see what it does and if it spits out any errors.  When that's done, I added it to root's crontab: &lt;code&gt;sudo crontab -e&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@ubnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;crontab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;opt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unifi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getsig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adblock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final question is why change from pfSense to USG?  Honestly, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; pfSense.  It is one of the best firewalls out there and arguably better than the USG.  But the USG ties in so nicely with the UI and dashboards with the rest of my Unifi gear.  With the USG I can get deep packet inspection and threat monitoring and it's all in one spot.  Yeah, I can get a lot of the same with pfSense but it's disjointed and as I'm getting, ahem, older and with much less time on my hands (as evident through the fact that I really only blog around Christmas and my other times off!) I don't want to fiddle as much.  My fiddle time is reserved for LEGO these days =) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, now that I have this thing working more or less the way that I want to, I'm sure I'll be making more time to fiddle... at least in the next week and a half!  Hopefully this is helpful to others thinking about either switching or standing up a USG of their own.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="dnsmasq"></category><category term="pfsense"></category><category term="usg"></category></entry><entry><title>What Makes Red Hat Enterprise Linux So Secure (Video)</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/what-makes-red-hat-enterprise-linux-so-secure-video" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-03T16:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-10-03T16:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2019-10-03:/blog/what-makes-red-hat-enterprise-linux-so-secure-video</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/redhat.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my move to PythonAnywhere a few weeks back, I got my Flask-based applications up and running quite easily (I have two, this blog and another application).  Then I had a bit of a heart attack on Friday realizing that Python 2 will be EOL at the end of the year.  I guess I've been hiding under a rock and far too busy with my other work -- I've not done much coding in a few years now.  At any rate, this caused a bit of a late-night panic for me so I spent Saturday thinking I would start converting both applications to Python 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I completed both on Saturday as well.  I was expecting to have to refactor and potentially rewrite more than I did, so come Saturday night I was more than pleased to realize that both were done and working as expected.  There weren't even a lot of things that needed to be changed so if I'm being honest, more time was spent refactoring code to silence pylint warnings than actually getting things to work with Python 3.7.  There were obvious things like using &lt;code&gt;print('foo')&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;print 'foo'&lt;/code&gt; and I found the &lt;a href="http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#compatible-idioms"&gt;Cheat Sheet: Writing Python 2-3 compatible code&lt;/a&gt; to be exceptionally helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a list of all I really needed to change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;print 'foo'&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;print('foo')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;urllib.urlencode()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;urllib.parse.urlencode()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;needing to UTF-8 encode a string before using hashlib on it, so:&lt;code&gt;'hashlib.md5(self.email.lower()).hexdigest()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;hashlib.md5(self.email.lower().encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ConfigParser became configparser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sgmllib is gone, so someone helpfully made sgmllib3k which will work for now but likely I'll need to find a solution for the future since it won't be maintained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;unicode()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and using BeautifulSoup4 rather than BeautifulSoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was relatively painless and there wasn't a lot that needed to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably a ton of little scripts that need to be updated, especially for the print changes, but this gives me some peace knowing it's not going to be that difficult to change existing Python 2 scripts to Python 3.  For some reason I figured this would be a terrible thing to have to do (like the stories I've heard about Perl 5 to 6).  Turns out it was not bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking at doing things like &lt;code&gt;'Some {} to print'.format(thing)&lt;/code&gt; vs using &lt;code&gt;'Some %s to print' % thing&lt;/code&gt; but after some poking around and looking in particular at &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5082452/string-formatting-vs-format"&gt;this StackOverflow question&lt;/a&gt; I figured that some things still work and are better left alone.  I'm sure there are a ton of optimizations and things I can do to make my code better now that it's running on Python 3, but that's stuff I can do in the future be it another Saturday spent hacking on some code or over Christmas holidays.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Moved to PythonAnywhere</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/moved-to-python-anywhere" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-12T02:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-08-12T02:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2019-08-12:/blog/moved-to-python-anywhere</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/logo-234x35.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note that I've moved my blog from Liquid Web (which used to be WiredTree) since I didn't really need a full blown VPS anymore.  I was looking at a number of different solutions to host this blog, given it's python-based and, after a lot of reading and reviews, I settled on PythonAnywhere and so far I'm pretty happy.  Between CloudFlare for DNS and PythonAnywhere to do the actual hosting we'll see how it goes for the next month and if all is good... well, I'll save a pile of money each month which is always a good thing.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Open Source is 20; Let's Wander Down Memory Lane</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/open-source-is-20-lets-wander-down-memory-lane" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-11T00:45:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-02-11T00:45:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2018-02-11:/blog/open-source-is-20-lets-wander-down-memory-lane</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/Mandriva_family_tree_11-06.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a week behind as the 20th anniversary of "Open Source" was a week ago.  Back on February 3, 1998 the term "Open Source" was coined as a result of the decision of &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/netscape-offers-up-browser-source-code-for-free/"&gt;Netscape Communications Corp to give away the source code to it's Netscape Navigator browser&lt;/a&gt; earlier on January …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/Mandriva_family_tree_11-06.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a week behind as the 20th anniversary of "Open Source" was a week ago.  Back on February 3, 1998 the term "Open Source" was coined as a result of the decision of &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/netscape-offers-up-browser-source-code-for-free/"&gt;Netscape Communications Corp to give away the source code to it's Netscape Navigator browser&lt;/a&gt; earlier on January 23, 1998.  Red Hat has a nice recap of what happened then in its &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/20th-anniversary-open-source"&gt;Celebrating the 20th anniversary of open source&lt;/a&gt; blog post; ZDNet has another great writeup entitled &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-turns-20"&gt;Open source is 20: How it changed programming and business forever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My purpose in writing about this amazing milestone is mostly to wax nostalgic.  I remember when Navigator's source code was released.  At that time I was in the collections industry bouncing around between being a collector and a sysadmin at one of the collection agencies I worked at then.  Actually, as hateful of a job as that was, I'm grateful for it because it introduced me to HP-UX, which piqued my interest in operating systems other than DOS or Windows.  In fact, it was when I was working at the first collection agency where I did sysadmin work that I picked up my first non-Microsoft operating system to play with at home (OS/2 Warp 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first foray into Linux was trying out Slackware (I don't remember which version, I just remember borrowing a bunch of floppies from a friend to try it).  I also remember trying out Yggdrasil, and I'm pretty sure that one was on CD.  Neither of them at that time (probably mid-90s) were very attractive to me.  Using an already installed and configured HP-UX system at work was one thing, installing Linux back then was not very user-friendly for someone getting into *nix for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first Linux install that really took was Red Hat Linux 5.0.  OS/2 was my day-to-day system, but Linux was interesting to me for a variety of reasons.  This was back when the term "free software" was used; "Open Source" was yet to come.  I remember it being pretty ugly compared to OS/2 and I remember fighting with it, trying to make my SCSI CD-Writer work.  I also remember my wife being annoyed that I spent so much time tinkering with garbage hardware (since I scrounged up anything I could) and fiddling with something that equally fascinated and frustrated me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a BBS enthusiast, having run a BBS from high school, originally on DOS and then under OS/2 (which was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; for running a BBS and being able to use it while others were dialled in).  I moved through a bunch of different BBS software (Maximus/2, Renegade, Telegard... I'm actually shocked I remember some of these names so many years later!) and ended up using software called BBBS.  It should be noted that during my BBS days I ran two different Fido-style networks (one for sysops and one for fantasy topics), wrote documentation for a number of different BBS-related utilities, wrote some utilities of my own, and was generally very much involved in the BBS "tools" community.  When I started using BBBS I also &lt;a href="https://www.bbbs.net/sysop.html"&gt;took over the documentation&lt;/a&gt; and ran a documentation project on my Freezer Burn web site back then (more on Freezer Burn in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, BBBS/2 under OS/2 worked great until IBM decided to muck up a few fixpacks and I had a lot of trouble with OS/2 running my BBS.  Thankfully, I had some exposure to Linux, and BBBS had their BBBS/Li version that ran on Linux.  So I had an option to get my BBS running on a different, hopefully more stable, operating system than OS/2.  The problem was I had only half-heartedly tinkered with Linux before and if I was going to do this I really needed to learn it.  At that time, Linux-Mandrake 5.3 was my operating system of choice and I dove into learning it while trying to keep my BBS running and still doing my work as a collector (I made a conscious choice to fully remove OS/2 and replace it with Linux -- no fallback and no choice but to learn by doing).  And since I needed some utilities for my board that were not provided by Linux-Mandrake, I started getting involved in the community by providing fixes, patches, documentation updates, and new RPM packages and that's where things really got weird because within months I was writing Linux-related articles for a number of web sites like Tech Republic, trying to evangelize Linux locally and through my Freezer Burn web site, started my own consulting company, and eventually was asked to work for MandrakeSoft (which I started to do in 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local evangelism didn't work out well, although I did meet some interesting like-minded people locally as a result.  The "general packager and documentation" role turned into docs and "the odd security fix" so that Chmouel (our then security packager) could focus more on kernel work.  I was assured it wouldn't take much time (which was largely true, for about a year).  And the rest, as they say, is history.  There was soon enough no more time to work on documentation &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; security, so security took precedence and I was a one-man security team for Mandriva for many years until I got a few people able to help.  Fun fact: the entire security build and release system for Mandriva ran in my basement, built and written entirely by me.  Another fun fact: the entire release system for advisories and package uploads, urpmi metadata updates, etc. was done by a series of commandline PHP scripts (I did mention earlier that I didn't write in C, right?).  Say what you want, but the original scripts that I started with were written in Perl and the PHP rewrite was about 2x as fast and much easier for me to work on (because while working for MandrakeSoft I also did a lot of web design and hosting, so I spent a lot of time working in PHP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the real kicker: Open Source allowed me to fork Mandriva, reduce it and change it into Annvix because I wanted something with a greater security focus.  It gave me the opportunity to learn and spend a significant number of years building my own community, reusing the work others had done, and giving away the changes I had made to that work -- to everyone who was interested.  I couldn't have done that with any other operating system at the time, and the learning opportunities it afforded me were invaluable.  Without Open Source, that sort of thing would not have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after 9 years at Mandriva I left to come to Red Hat and celebrated 9 years here when Open Source celebrated its 20th anniversary.  Even the shift and growth in Open Source in the last 9 years amazes me.  When I joined Red Hat, RHEL6 was in beta and the current release was RHEL 5.3.  Things that I take for granted now, like OpenStack and OpenShift, containers... these things didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look back and see that out of the 20 years of Open Source, I've spent 18 of them working directly for Open Source companies... companies that devoted all they had to benefit from and contribute to Open Source.  One didn't make it, despite being an excellent distro and having some amazing co-workers (many of whom, thankfully, are now also at Red Hat!), and one that did.  I remember the shock and pride when we were able to say we were &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/its-official-red-hat-becomes-the-first-1-billion-open-source-company-2012-3"&gt;the first $1B Open Source company&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.  Four years later in 2016 we were &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-becomes-first-2b-open-source-company/"&gt;the first $2B Open Source company&lt;/a&gt;.  While there are many companies that bet on Open Source and failed, there are many that succeeded -- but those are not the only success stories of Open Source.  The fact that companies like IBM and Microsoft embrace Open Source today is a testament to the work that the Open Source community has done in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that non-tech companies like WalMart and other retailers not only use Open Source but create it, is amazing.  The fact that home stereo systems, TVs, cell phones, and much of the technology we take for granted today would not exist without Open Source really makes me grateful that I am able to be a part of this epic journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I honestly don't know what I would be doing today if it wasn't for Open Source.  My mind can't even fathom its absence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="redhat"></category></entry><entry><title>Red Hat Container Health Index</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/red-hat-container-health-index" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-02T14:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2017-05-02T14:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2017-05-02:/blog/red-hat-container-health-index</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/rhsummit.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been using GitLab for a while now and I really like it.  I can't objectively say whether it's better than GitHub or not (I have a few projects on GitHub but I rarely make any changes to them and even more rarely use the web UI), but one of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/gitlab.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using GitLab for a while now and I really like it.  I can't objectively say whether it's better than GitHub or not (I have a few projects on GitHub but I rarely make any changes to them and even more rarely use the web UI), but one of the things I appreciate about GitLab is the fact that I can run my own copy of it and store my own stuff in it.  I also use it every day for work and at home so am much more familiar with it than GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been playing with the CI aspect of GitLab.  I've used Jenkins to handle "CI duties" in the past, and GitLab and Jenkins work quite well together, but I wanted to play around with GitLab's built-in CI because of how tightly integrated it is (and since I run a small GitLab here at home, I can use the same system for my runners and don't have to worry about setting up Jenkins).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it quite easy to setup, although there are a few things to be aware of and I wanted to note them here.  Partly so if I need to do it again in the future it'll be easy for me to refer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the user to run the service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# groupadd -g 2001 otter
# useradd -u 2001 -g 2001 -d /srv/www/otter -s /bin/bash otter
# chmod 0711 /srv/www/otter
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above creates the "otter" user and group which will run the service and makes &lt;em&gt;/srv/www/otter&lt;/em&gt; traversable since we will checkout the git repository (as user otter) and it will live in &lt;em&gt;/srv/www/otter/otter/&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# su - otter
$ mkdir otter
$ cd otter
$ git clone https://[gitlab-url]/otter.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is public so there is no need for authentication.  If you had a private project you could still authenticate over HTTPS by creating a &lt;em&gt;~/.netrc&lt;/em&gt; file that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;machine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab-host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab-user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this I added the otter user to &lt;em&gt;/etc/sudoers&lt;/em&gt; to be able to restart the otter.service but that didn't work out so well.  When I used the following in &lt;em&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;otter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;cd otter &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git pull &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo /bin/systemctl restart otter.service&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the CI does not allocate a pseudo-terminal, which is ultimately required for sudo (even though we set up the private key without a password), the deployment failed.  This means that while we can deploy the new code via calling &lt;strong&gt;git pull&lt;/strong&gt;, we cannot restart the gunicorn daemon that is serving the content.  A work-around for this is to setup a cronjob to run every minute and look for a specific file, since we can easily do something like &lt;strong&gt;touch /srv/www/otter/otter.restart&lt;/strong&gt; with our ssh call after doing the git pull.  So editing &lt;em&gt;/etc/crontab&lt;/em&gt; and adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;* * * * * root test -f /srv/www/otter/otter.restart &amp;amp;&amp;amp; /bin/systemctl restart otter.service &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rm -f /srv/www/otter/otter.restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;does the trick.  This actually is a bit nicer than trying to use sudo because it's still only root that can restart the service and given &lt;em&gt;/srv/www/otter&lt;/em&gt; is writable only by the otter user, and outside the git repository, nothing else that isn't either a root or otter process can create the file.  This removes the need to change anything in &lt;em&gt;/etc/sudoers&lt;/em&gt; or give this user any kind of special permissions.  The downside is this will add an entry every minute to &lt;em&gt;/var/log/cron&lt;/em&gt;, but change the threshold to whatever you want (i.e. use "*/5" to check every 5 minutes if preferred).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this, the &lt;em&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/em&gt; file was updated to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;otter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;cd otter &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git pull &amp;amp;&amp;amp; touch /srv/www/otter/otter.restart&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are other considerations that can and should be done here.  For instance, if you have database changes, the above isn't sufficient for an automatic deployment so a script to make changes to the database as part of the deployment would probably be good.  This could be an external script or something that your systemd initscript handles, or the web application itself.  One thought that comes to mind is to use a table in the database for configuration information and store a version in the database that can be compared and if less than what the script expects, automatically perform the migration at start.  (Note to self, I should implement this...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, the full &lt;em&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/em&gt; file looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;centos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;stages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is handled using a project variable in GitLab which can be set by going to the project in question, clicking the gear icon and selecting "Variables".  You want to add a variable named &lt;strong&gt;SSH_PRIVATE_KEY&lt;/strong&gt; with the contents of a private key you generate.  The corresponding public key would be added to the &lt;em&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/em&gt; file for, in this case, the otter user on "production.host".  You can read more about &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/variables/README.html" target="_blank"&gt;GitLab variables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and I mention this because I found using systemd's initscripts a little bit painful at first (especially with mod_uwsgi, which is why I opted to use gunicorn and mod_proxy instead, see &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/current-progress-of-new-blog-platform"&gt;my earlier blog post about this&lt;/a&gt; for more details), I leave you with the service scripts.  There are two scripts in question, the &lt;em&gt;otter.socket&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;otter.service&lt;/em&gt; scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;otter.socket&lt;/em&gt; sets up the listeners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;otter socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Socket]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ListenStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/run/otter/socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ListenStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;0.0.0.0:5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Install]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;WantedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;sockets.target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;em&gt;otter.service&lt;/em&gt; runs the gunicorn service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;otter daemon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Requires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;otter.socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;After&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;network.target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Service]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;PIDFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/run/otter/pid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;otter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;otter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/srv/www/otter/otter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExecStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/srv/www/otter/otter/flask/bin/gunicorn --pid /run/otter/pid --access-logfile /srv/www/otter/otter.log app:app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Install]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;WantedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;multi-user.target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These files need to live in &lt;em&gt;/etc/systemd/system/&lt;/em&gt; and are enabled using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# systemctl enable otter.socket
# systemctl enable otter.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a &lt;em&gt;/etc/tmpfiles.d/otter.conf&lt;/em&gt; for the socket file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;d /run/otter 0755 otter otter -
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which can be setup using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# systemd-tmpfiles --create
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd want to do that before starting the services for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this is helpful for someone who is interested in running a Flask application as a service under systemd with some CI integration using GitLab.  It covers a little bit more than just using GitLab CI to deploy remotely, although all the pieces are tied together and it seemed odd to focus on the one part of the picture without giving some details on the rest to make things work.  One thing I did consider is making the systemd services to be user services so that the otter user could &lt;strong&gt;systemctl restart otter.service&lt;/strong&gt; but I didn't really get around to it and it didn't really matter to me (perhaps something to fiddle with in the future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love any feedback or ideas for improvement.  This is all pretty new to me yet so undoubtably there are ways these can be implemented better, but this works and I felt like sharing.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="gitlab"></category><category term="ci"></category><category term="docker"></category></entry><entry><title>Countdown to SHA1-based HTTPS Doom</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/countdown-to-sha1-based-https-doom" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-11-22T22:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-11-22T22:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2016-11-22:/blog/countdown-to-sha1-based-https-doom</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So it's been noted in a few places that 2017 is the year that SHA1 for HTTPS is doomed.

&lt;p&gt;Most sites today don't use SHA1-based SSL certificates (which is good) and there are sites you can go to in order to easily check if your public web site is using one, such as &lt;a href="https://shaaaaaaaaaaaaa.com/"&gt;shaaaaaaaaaaaaa.com&lt;/a&gt;, but what about internal services?  You can't really point an external web site to an internal resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few sites out there that explain how to do it, but as I had to poke at a few things internally myself I figured it was worth sharing the simple script I wrote to check.  Cut-n-paste the following into something like sha1checker.sh and run it.  It will tell you if you're using a SHA1-based certificate or, if not, tell you what is used (hopefully "sha256WithRSAEncryption"):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

site="${1}"

if [ -n "${2}" ]; then
    port="${2}"
else
    port="443"
fi


algo="$(openssl s_client -connect ${site}:${port} &lt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null | openssl x509 -text -in /dev/stdin | grep 'Signature Algorithm')"

if [ "${algo}" == "" ]; then
    echo "Unable to load certificate!  Invalid hostname (${site}) or port (${port})"
    exit 1
fi

if [ "$(echo ${algo} | grep -q sha1; echo $?)" == "0" ]; then
    echo "Vulnerable, using SHA1"
else
    echo "Not vulnerable"
    echo "${algo}"
fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy enough to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sh sha1checker.sh annvix.com 443
Not vulnerable
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not perfect (it seems to wig out with the version of openssl provided with macOS unless you're using a version supplied with Fink, but it works well on Linux).  Now is probably a good time to check this stuff out before you end up locked out of some essential web services come January.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="openssl"></category></entry><entry><title>From There to Here (But Not Back Again) - 15 years of Red Hat Product Security</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/from-there-to-here-but-not-back-again" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-24T07:53:00-06:00</published><updated>2016-10-24T07:53:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2016-10-24:/blog/from-there-to-here-but-not-back-again</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://annvix.com/images/shadowman-tattoo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today marks one month that my "work time" is 100% devoted to Red Hat; last month I "retired" from any of the IT/web work for my church that I've been doing for the last 12 or so years.  It's been an interesting month being able to spend time on things that I want to spend on outside of regular Red Hat work hours.  =)  My rediscovered and available time has been spent fiddling around the house dealing with things I never really had time to get to in quite a while, and some on computer-related things that I've wanted to do but never had the time to do.  One of the things on this long todo list was to do some "security reviews" of passwords and related things (GPG keys, SSH keys, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review became a bit more pressing for two reasons: macOS Sierra ships with a version of OpenSSH that does not use DSA keys by default, and a former client of mine phoned me two weeks ago because they were phished for $150k and he was looking for help.  The latter reminded me that it's good to review the landscape every once in a while and keep up to date with changes, the former was the impetus to actually do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the DSA key change, and because (to my chagrin) I still used such a key for a few hosts, I decided to do some cleanup of my SSH keys first.  To maintain compatibility with some older hosts that may not support newer key types like ECDSA, I opted to create a new 2048 bit RSA key for use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "user@host"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the real fun began when I had to remember where the old keys were being used and updating them.  I had a half-dozen SSH keys of various types (DSA, 1024 bit RSA, 2048 bit RSA) and decided to consolidate things and cleanup my ~/.ssh/known_hosts and ~/.ssh/config files as well.  I started primarily with making a clean ~/.ssh directory and backing up the old one so I can still keep it for those hosts I'm likely to have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, when you upgrade to macOS Sierra it overwrites /etc/ssh/sshd_config and /etc/ssh/ssh_config so I had to make changes there with respects to kerberos authentication.  The options are the same; basically you want to set &lt;b&gt;GSSAPIAuthentication yes&lt;/b&gt; in both config files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-checked my GPG key and it's a 3072 bit RSA key, so doing alright there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the coming days is to update passwords on some sites where it's not been changed in a long time.  I use 1Password (you could use any password manager you like) so I have distinct and unique passwords on each site, but some of them are a bit weaker than I would like.  One nice feature of 1Password is the "Security Audit" section that lists passwords that are weak, duplicates, and then those that have not been changed in a while (broken down in 3+ years old, 1-3 years old, and 6-12 months old).  Thankfully the weak password count is fairly low, but the 3+ year old list is a bit higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people recommend changing passwords often, but I disagree with this.  For instance, whenever you change your password you introduce some risk (is the site currently compromised?  are you?  is there someone listening on the wire as you make the change?) so there are some instances where it makes sense, but if you're rotating passwords every 3mos or so I have to wonder what the point is (and point out that you're actually increasing risk when you do).  So use a good password or passphrase, make sure they are different for each site (so a compromise of one doesn't compromise you on another, etc.).  Having said that, it's good to change passwords every once in a while.  The security policy of the site may have changed -- maybe when you first signed up they kept passwords in plaintext for some insane reason, and in a later software update they started storing it properly, or maybe they used to store the password as a weak md5 hash and have since moved to a stronger sha256.  The point is, even though your password may have been strong, you don't know how they have stored it on the remote side and in a lot of these cases, you're at their mercy even if you use a good password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can almost always tell if the remote end has bad security policies by doing the "forgotten password" request... if they send you your password, you might want to move on from that site entirely (a server should not be able to send you your password in plaintext!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the sites you use offer two-factor authentication (sometimes called two-step authentication) I do recommend using it.  Sometimes it's a pain, but (as in the case of this former client) using two-factor authentication would have kept someone from accessing his email account and convincing his bank to wire a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of money out of the country.  The idiocy of the bank aside, this is a pretty costly reminder that some really smart people can do some really creative things to steal a buck, and some other (equally smart or not nearly as smart, you decide) people can get suckered.  How that bank handled that situation was &lt;i&gt;beyond&lt;/i&gt; ridiculous, which sort of drives home the point that ultimately it's up to you to be your own advocate and first line of defence.  Good passwords, good security "know how", and just plain old being smart (don't click random links in email, people!) are really the best things you can do to save yourself a lot of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while there is a balance between security and convenience, with some things (like 1Password) you can get a measure of both.  And education... education is important.  We as humans are really good at learning about the things that matter to us... healthy eating, responsible money management, and so on... we need to drive home the message that security is important and it starts with the individual and their computing habits.  As security professionals, we almost need these horror stories to shock people into action but it seems like when the horror stories come in rapid succession, we tend to filter them out.  These things becoming "normal" is not ok.  Humans tend to minimize how awful something is unless it happens to them.  And sometimes we need bad things to happen more than once to really drive it home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an illustration, a neighbour had a drive die and the last time this happened a few years ago I helped him get sorted out with a backup system and made it quite clear how important it was by sharing my own experiences.  However, over time, the backups happened less and now those pictures, financial information, and other things are... poof... gone.  He's an example of being bit, perhaps not hard enough the first time, but hopefully hard enough &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; time.  I've been bit once (hard!) and I would gladly pay the cost of multiple redundant backups than deal with that kind of data loss again.  I suspect this time he will too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that isn't really security-related, per se, I think it's probably something that people can appreciate due to their own experiences -- when it comes to some of the damage that comes from security breaches or information theft, I don't want people to have those experiences!  So while we can't fully control what information we provide to a site that may or may not get exposed, we can certainly try to reduce the damage and we should.  I've spoken to homeschool groups about exactly this and I was probably more shocked overall than they were!  They were shocked at all the naughty stuff that can happen and I was shocked that they didn't know even the half of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could keep going (maybe I should, maybe a multitude of voices shouting from the rooftops that this stuff is actually serious will make a difference), but I'll stop here.  Suffice it to say that while I think there is a great, and growing, responsibility on site owners to protect their customers and users, the sad reality is these things are based on software written by humans and humans make mistakes.  I've been doing security response work for over 15 years now and while certain things become better, other things are horribly, &lt;i&gt;horribly&lt;/i&gt; broken (don't even get me started on IoT!) and we have a lot to do to fix them and educate the coders of the future on how &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to write these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since there will always be users, we need to educate them so that they know the risks and how best to minimize them.  We can try, and often succeed, in keeping users safe, but it only takes one crack in the armor and then it becomes a matter of minimizing damage and the user who has prepared for this (because it &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; happen) will be much better off than the user that didn't or, even worse, didn't even realize it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Current progress of new blog platform</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/current-progress-of-new-blog-platform" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-05T16:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2016-08-05T16:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2016-08-05:/blog/current-progress-of-new-blog-platform</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've not had much time in the past week to work on the blog platform due to getting back to work after two weeks off.

So that means future enhancements to the blog will take a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to implement a fairly basic commenting system that works well, so at least now you can offer your thoughts and comments on blog posts.  The one thing that's really missing before I redirect the old linsec.ca site to here is searching.  I think search capabilities are quite important.  Flask can do this with Whooshalchemy, which would be awesome except I opted to use Peewee (which we use at work in a few places, so it helps me learn it better) rather than SQLAlchemy.  It also looks like you can do full text search quite easily if you were using SQLite but alas, I'm using MySQL on the backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it looks like the next step is to write something that uses Whoosh for searching, but also integrates with Peewee (in a way that Flask-WhooshAlchemy would).  I might look into writing something quick-n-dirty from scratch, or I might poke at Flask-WhooshAlchemy and see if there might be a future Flask-WhooshPeewee... you never know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone on the interwebs has figured this out already though, I would be really keen on hearing what you have to say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue that currently bothers me a little bit is the UWSGI integration.  Because I'm using mod_proxy_uwsgi and running this site as a UWSGI application, I have a systemd unit file to run it, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

WorkingDirectory=/mysite/flask
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash -c 'cd /mysite/flask; source flask/bin/activate; /mysite/flask/flask/bin/uwsgi --ini /mysite/flask/annvix.ini'
RuntimeDirectory=/mysite/flask
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whenever I run &lt;code&gt;systemctl start annvix-flask&lt;/code&gt;, it sits for a &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; time before releasing to the console and the systemctl status show it as "activating":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# systemctl status annvix-flask

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing that I've read explains why this might be the case.  It works, the site is obviously running, but systemd thinks it's still activating  and when it finally releases it's saying it has timed out.  This is a cheap plea to smart folks that may have the answer (although if I do figure out why it's doing this, I'll be sure to use the new commenting feature to share the answer).&lt;/p&gt;

I'm working towards migrating from IPA in a KVM-based virtual machine running CentOS 6 to one running CentOS 7 and the way of making serial consoles work in 7 is different than it was in 6 because CentOS 7 (and thus RHEL7) use Grub2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of editing /boot/grub.cfg, you need to edit /etc/defaults/grub and add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
GRUB_TERMINAL="serial"
GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --unit=0 --speed=115200"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above will enable Grub output to the serial console.  Next, change the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX command to the following so you can use "virsh console" to connect to the guest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rhgb quiet console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have saved the file, you need to recreate the grub.cfg file with grub2-mkconfig:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, reboot the system and you should be able to use "virsh console [VMNAME]" to have a serial console to the guest.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="grub"></category><category term="kvm"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting started with firewalld</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/getting-started-with-firewalld" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-15T20:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2015-08-15T20:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2015-08-15:/blog/getting-started-with-firewalld</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly writing this for my own reference as I spent a bunch of time figuring this out while I was on holidays with some serious oVirt misadventures and didn't document any of what I did, so since I had to reinstall CentOS 7, I'm stuck doing this all over …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly writing this for my own reference as I spent a bunch of time figuring this out while I was on holidays with some serious oVirt misadventures and didn't document any of what I did, so since I had to reinstall CentOS 7, I'm stuck doing this all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively I'm migrating from CentOS 6 to CentOS 7 and trying to take advantage of the new way of doing things.  I could easily switch things to use /etc/sysconfig/iptables (that I can handle pretty much in my sleep) but it feels a bit like cheating, so I want to figure out firewalld which is to me a totally alien way of handling my firewall rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say that there may be better ways of doing this (and, to you the reader, probably far better tutorials), but this is how I went about it.  This is on a CentOS 7.1 system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, it's active and enabled (in particular pay attention to the enabled bit that is bolded above) so on a reboot it will come up.  firewalld has this concept of &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FirewallD#Which_zones_are_available.3F"&gt;zones&lt;/a&gt;, so you can set certain ethernet interfaces to be assigned to a particular zone.  The default zone is public, but as this is an internal DNS/DHCP/web server for my LAN, I want to set it to the internal zone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --get-zones
block dmz drop external home internal public trusted work
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=internal
success
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to make sure that the one ethernet interface on this machine, enp2s0 (so long eth0!) is assigned the same zone.  I believe this would happen by default, but it doesn't hurt to be explicit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --change-interface=enp2s0 --permanent
success
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can see how this zone is configured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --list-all
internal (default, active)
  interfaces: enp2s0
  sources:
  services: dhcpv6-client ipp-client mdns samba-client ssh
  ports:
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports:
  icmp-blocks:
  rich rules:
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a lot there right now and it's definitely setup to be a workstation, not a server.  You can see the available list of services that come pre-defined (they are XML files in /usr/lib/firewalld/services) by using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --get-services
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to examine any of the listed services, just look at the XML file.  For instance, /usr/lib/firewalld/services/dns.xml looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&amp;lt;service&gt;
  &amp;lt;short&gt;DNS&amp;lt;/short&gt;
  &amp;lt;description&gt;The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to provide and request host and domain names. Enable this option, if you plan to provide a domain name service (e.g. with bind).&amp;lt;/description&gt;
  &amp;lt;port protocol="tcp" port="53"/&gt;
  &amp;lt;port protocol="udp" port="53"/&gt;
&amp;lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward.  When adding new services or rules, firewalld makes them temporary, in that they will persist until a reboot or service restart.  You need to use the "--permanent" option to, well, make them permanent.  Since this server is going to do DNS/DHCP/HTTP/HTTPS we need to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=http
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=https
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=dns
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=dhcp
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --reload
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --list-all
internal (default, active)
  interfaces: enp2s0
  sources:
  services: dhcp dhcpv6-client dns http https ipp-client mdns samba-client ssh
  ports:
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports:
  icmp-blocks:
  rich rules:
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above we added four services: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and DHCP.  We then reloaded the rules (so as to apply them) and then listed the internal zone where we can now see our new services are enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to enable a service for which no default service definition exists, you can create one in /etc/firewalld/services/ as an XML file (copy a similar one from /usr/lib/firewalld/services/ and adjust for your service).  If you're using SELinux, be sure to run &lt;code&gt;restorecon -Rv /etc/firewalld&lt;/code&gt; and make sure the XML file has 0640 permissions and is owned root:root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of making a new service, however, you can simply add ports to the configuration which might be easier.  For instance, if I wanted to expose apcupsd but didn't want to make a service I might do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --add-port=3551/udp --permanent
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --add-port=3551/tcp --permanent
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --reload
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --list-all
internal (default, active)
  interfaces: enp2s0
  sources:
  services: dhcp dhcpv6-client dns http https ipp-client mdns samba-client ssh
  ports: 3551/udp 3551/tcp
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports:
  icmp-blocks:
  rich rules:
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief, managing the firewall is a little bit annoying to do this way compared to the old way of "vim /etc/sysconfig/iptables; service iptables restart" but I can understand why it's done this way now.  It's quite modular and adaptable and allows you to make temporary changes to the firewall easily without having to know iptables commands.  There are a lot of commands, and since firewalls tend not to be things you tinker with often, they may not be overly memorable (thus deciding to write this after my second time of doing it in as many weeks as I didn't remember a darn thing).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="centos"></category><category term="firewalld"></category><category term="iptables"></category><category term="rhel"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Blocking ad networks with named</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/blocking-ad-networks-with-named" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-01T14:04:00-06:00</published><updated>2015-08-01T14:04:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2015-08-01:/blog/blocking-ad-networks-with-named</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've meant to do this for ages, so on my first day of my "staycation", despite vowing to myself that I wouldn't look at a computer screen this week (hey, it's not actually the technical start of my week off is it?), I fiddled this morning with BIND to try …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've meant to do this for ages, so on my first day of my "staycation", despite vowing to myself that I wouldn't look at a computer screen this week (hey, it's not actually the technical start of my week off is it?), I fiddled this morning with BIND to try and avoid seeing ads on my devices.  While AdBlock works great on my browsers, that doesn't transfer well to mobile devices and apps with built-in advertising, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you're running your own BIND DNS server at home, you won't be able to do this.  If you have a home network with named running (my local network does) and unless you restrict all outbound DNS and allow DNS lookups only from your named server (which I do, it forces all of the machines on the system to use my DNS server which is configured to only ask OpenDNS for DNS info), this also won't really work for you (at least not in the way that I've done it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this assumes some knowledge of BIND and networking.  This is not so much a tutorial on how to configure BIND as it is some quick tips and shared info on what I did this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you need to setup a master zone.  Mine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
zone "rpz.linsec.ca" {
        type master;
        file "master/rpz.linsec.ca.zone";
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; You may also need the following in your &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; section, but I'm not 100% sure as it was there before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    response-policy {
        zone "rpz.linsec.ca";
    };
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes anything defined in this zone to be considered authoritative, just like the DNS settings I have for my local network.  As an aside, you can use this to block entire domains (like youtube or facebook if you have kids at home staring at screens all day...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then wrote a script which pulls data from &lt;a href="http://mvpshostsnews.blogspot.ca/"&gt;MVPS Hosts&lt;/a&gt;.  Their data is meant to be put into a hosts file, but that means it would only work on a single machine and I'm trying to solve a multi-machine/mobile issue, not just a single computer.  The script takes my rpz.linsec.ca.zone file and mashes in data from MVPS Hosts and to create a new file that we will use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
IFS=$'\n'

input=$(mktemp /tmp/mvps.hosts.XXXXXX)
output=$(mktemp /tmp/rpz.linsec.ca.zone.XXXXXX)
source="/etc/named/rpz.linsec.ca.zone"
serial=$(grep serial ${source} | awk '{print $1}')
n_serial="$(date +%Y%m%d)01"

curl -s http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt &gt;${input}

dos2unix -o ${input} &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

lines=$(wc -l ${input} | awk '{print $1}')

if [ ${lines} -lt 10000 ]; then
    exit 1
fi

for line in $(cat ${source}); do
    if [ "${line}" == ";START ADHOSTS" ]; then
        break
    else
        echo ${line} &gt;&gt;${output}
   fi
done

echo "" &gt;&gt;${output}
echo ";START ADHOSTS" &gt;&gt;${output}
for hostname in $(cat ${input} | egrep -v '^#' | awk '{print $2}'); do
    if [ "${hostname}" != "localhost" ]; then
        echo "${hostname}    IN    CNAME    ." &gt;&gt;${output}
    fi
done
echo ";END ADHOSTS" &gt;&gt;${output}

perl -pi -e "s/${serial}/${n_serial}/g" ${output}

rm -f ${input}
cp -f ${output} ${source}
rm -f ${output}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you need dos2unix installed.  Everything else is fairly standard.  The MVPS Hosts file seems to be updated monthly, so this something you could possibly add to a monthly cronjob or just run manually every once in a while.  So far it seems to work pretty good over here.  I had initially thought about writing something in python, but bash is just so much faster (for me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you put things in your zone file before the ";START ADHOSTS" line they'll be retained, so if you do want to block specific domains (you may want to block iadsdk.apple.com and qwapi.com if you don't want to see iOS iAd ads) you still can, and take advantage of the MVPS Hosts list (if someone has a better list, I would love to see it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone else out.  Comments for improvement are welcome, this was a pretty quick-and-dirty script that, I'll admit, does a few things oddly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="ads"></category><category term="blocking"></category><category term="dns"></category><category term="named"></category></entry><entry><title>Custom Email Notifications in GitLab</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/custom-email-notifications-in-gitlab" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-07T10:44:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-01-07T10:44:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2015-01-07:/blog/custom-email-notifications-in-gitlab</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started playing around with GitLab last month in order to get to know it a better and, while I like it well enough, the one thing that drove me nuts was the email that it sent out alerting of changes.

My old git setup used the wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.icir.org/robin/git-notifier/"&gt;git-notifier&lt;/a&gt; script to send out emails and I &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; prefer the format it used than the format GitLab uses.  Unfortunately, at that time, without ponying up for the enterprise edition it didn't look feasible to change without some serious work that I didn't have the time or effort to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was looking at the latest version (7.6.2) and noticed the community edition support for &lt;a href="http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/hooks/custom_hooks.html"&gt;custom hooks&lt;/a&gt;.  After upgrading, I fiddled with it and git-notifier to try to make the two work well together.  With a little elbow-grease (git-notifier works well with straight git repos or gitolite) I got it to work, although it is a bit of a nuisance because, with regular git or gitolite, you can get some information from the repo exposed via the calling scripts and environment that does not seem to be present in GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow the instructions on the custom hooks document referenced above, you'll end up with something along the lines of /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories/&lt;group&gt;/&lt;project&gt;.git/custom_hooks (in my case it is /srv/git-data/repositories/&lt;group&gt;/&lt;project&gt;.git/custom_hooks).  In this directory (which must be owned git:git, including all its contents) lives a post-receive script which looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
repo_name="mygroup/myrepo"

base_dir="/srv/git-data/repositories"
git_host="gitlab.myhost.com"
send_from="mailer@myhost.com"
send_to="commits@myhost.com"

pushd ${base_dir}/${repo_name}.git &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

/srv/git-hooks/git-notifier $@ --link="http://${git_host}/${repo_name}/commit/%s" --sender="${send_from}"  \
  --mailinglist="${send_to}" --repouri="ssh://git@${git_host}:${repo_name}.git" --emailprefix="[git/%r]"

popd &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have git-notifier in a directory called /srv/git-hooks and it's owned root:root and mode 0755.  This will tell git-notifier to send an email to the $send_to address, from the $send_from address, and defines a few things like the repository itself and the host (all things that would normally be exposed via the environment in a git or gitolite setup but are lacking with GitLab).  But this can be used as a template and the only thing you should have to change is the value of $repo_name (everything else can be the same unless you need to define them differently per-repo or per-group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside to this is that you need shell access to set it up, which may prove troublesome for larger installations or shared environments.  For a personal or work environment this is probably an ok requirement.  Make sure that you disable the "Emails on push" service for the repository in GitLab or you'll get both the stock GitLab commitdiff email and git-notifier's email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm extremely grateful for those who contributed this support to GitLab as it means I spent a lot less time dorking around with this than I would have had I done it all myself, and while it was a bit of a nuisance to setup, it works quite well and I'm back to getting my old style of email notifications which are much more useful (for one thing, GitLab seems to have an upper size limit and if that is exceeded it sends no mail at all, whereas git-notifier will send you a list of changed files without the actual diff... a much more useful and meaningful email than sending nothing at all (if you look at git-notifier's changelog you'll see that was contributed by me in version 0.3-18, almost 2.5 years ago... that's how long I've been using git-notifier)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could contribute some sane code back to git-notifier to support GitLab, but without GitLab exposing things like the repository name or committer name to the environment I don't think it would be possible unless I've missed something non-obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="git"></category><category term="git-notifier"></category><category term="gitlab"></category></entry><entry><title>SSL Certificate Verification failure with fink's Python 2.7.9</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/ssl-certificate-verification-failure-with-finks-python-2-7-9" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-06T23:50:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-01-06T23:50:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2015-01-06:/blog/ssl-certificate-verification-failure-with-finks-python-2-7-9</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/"&gt;Python 2.7.9 was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a month ago and with it came some SSL-related changes (it backported the Python 3.4 ssl module and does HTTPS certificate validation using the system's certificate store).

The latter can cause some problems with home-grown CA's, however.  On Mac OS X, the CA certificate store is in the Keychain Access application which isn't exposed to commandline tools like Python.  This will cause HTTPS certificate validation to fail because Python doesn't know anything about the CA certificate used to sign the certificate being used by a HTTPS server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're using the system OpenSSL, supposedly you can export the CA's of interest to the /System/Library/OpenSSL/cert.pem file (untested).  I use fink and fink's OpenSSL does not seem to use this directory.  Instead it uses /sw/etc/ssl/ and if you install fink's ca-bundle package you will have a stock /sw/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt file which presumably works with some applications.  This file can be replaced with an updated CA bundle containing the CA certificate that is used to sign the service(s) you want to connect to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, replacing that file is not enough.  If you upgrade to Python 2.7.9 in fink and make that change, you will still see this annoying error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:581)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when attempting to connect to a site using a certificate signed by a non-stock CA.  Note that prior to 2.7.9, Python did not do this CA validation so you would not see this error until upgrading to 2.7.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix is quite simple.  Put your new ca-bundle.crt file in place as noted above, and then, as root, symlink this file to /sw/etc/ssl/cert.pem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# cd /sw/etc/ssl
# ln -s certs/ca-bundle.crt cert.pem
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when using Python 2.7.9 (on a fink-using system) you will be able to connect to those sites and avoid the "certificate verify failed" error noted above.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Heartbleed</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/heartbleed" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-04-12T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2014-04-12T13:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2014-04-12:/blog/heartbleed</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've refrained from posting or saying anything about Heartbleed all week because I didn't want to add to any sensationalism and hype, and I've also been too busy actually dealing with it (as opposed to simply talking about it or running around with hands waving in the air like a …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've refrained from posting or saying anything about Heartbleed all week because I didn't want to add to any sensationalism and hype, and I've also been too busy actually dealing with it (as opposed to simply talking about it or running around with hands waving in the air like a mad man).  Now that the dust has settled a bit, I just want to link to some sites that I think are good to keep handy as we see this play out.  I don't need to talk about the flaw itself as all you need to do is google "heartbleed" and you'll get all the info you want; certainly more than I can provide here (although you will have to distill the sensational from the facts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="https://zmap.io/heartbleed/"&gt;Heartbleed Bug Health Report&lt;/a&gt;; they're keeping it up to date, but it's essentially a "top 1000 still-vulnerable sites" list
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2014/04/09/heartbleed-bug-websites-affected/"&gt;Mashable's Heartbleed Hit List&lt;/a&gt; which has a list of some of the bigger sites/services that were (or were not) affected and whether they still are; when I looked this morning it was last updated as of last night so presumably they're keeping it fairly up to date
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/heartbleed-bug-apps-affected-list/#!DLTZK"&gt;DigitalTrends Mobile app list&lt;/a&gt; which has a list of vulnerable/not-vulnerable mobile apps
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://heartbleed.com/"&gt;The Heartbleed site&lt;/a&gt; which is being kept up to date with regards to linking to various advisories
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these sites (and the apps that use such sites) have been fixed this week.  There is speculation that this has been known for a while which means the "window of opportunity" may be much bigger than was initially thought.  Some of the numbers being tossed around are pretty gross exaggerations though (one I saw was "66% of the internet vulnerable!") so you have to take things with a grain of salt.  The best advice is to look at the sites you use and if they have fixed the flaw (and were previously vulnerable) and recommend you doing something (like changing your password), strongly consider doing as they suggest -- &lt;b&gt;PROVIDED THEY HAVE ALREADY FIXED THE FLAW&lt;/b&gt;!  Sorry for the caps but I talked to some people yesterday who had rushed to change their password and when I asked them if the site in question was fixed already, they gave me a blank stare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does you NO good to change your password to a site that is STILL vulnerable.  You will only have to change it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, look at the sites noted above, breathe, and keep in mind that changing passwords occasionally is a good thing.  Maybe now is the time to start using something like LastPass, 1Password, KeePass, or something similar and having it generate pure random nonsense for a password, knowing that you can use this tool/service to remember it for you (although, arguably, this whole situation makes me quite happy that I use 1Password (an app on my computer) instead of a service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last point on this is that people need to upgrade if they're using an affected version of OpenSSL.  If you are, and your operating system provides it (which is the case with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, among many others) then you really should be updating to the packages provided.  It's not a question of whether you should or shouldn't -- you should.  Period.  This has been a crazy week and a lot of crazy things have happened and this is a really really bad thing IF you're affected.  So if you are (as in you're running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or a current Fedora, etc.) then you really need to update ASAP.  And then you need to assess your next steps (changing passwords on vulnerable (and now fixed) services, revoking and reissuing certificates if you feel it necessary, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that's all I have to say about Heartbleed.  It will be interesting to see what the next few weeks will be like as we continue to get a bigger picture of what's happened here, how, and to whom.  And to see what damage has been done, and who responded appropriately and when.  For instance, if there were a site or service I was using and as of today (being Saturday, and this thing exploded on Monday) it was still NOT fixed, I don't think I would be using that site/service anymore.  To put it into perspective, Red Hat had updates out late Monday for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 and the other affected products early Tuesday morning (my time).  Everything was available to customers in under 24hrs.  It's not hard to install -- "yum update" and reboot (to make sure everything is covered).  So for a site to be still affected by this now?  There's really no excuse as far as I'm concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, just to note that I did get some minor press coverage (so this is more vanity than useful), &lt;a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/FOSS-Community-Hustles-to-Fix-Gaping-Heartbleed-Flaw-80263.html"&gt;LinuxInsider reported on Heartbleed&lt;/a&gt; and my name is noted, although my answers to the questions must have been less than exciting as there wasn't too much noted there other than where Red Hat customers could go for more info.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to finish off, the obligatory xkcd:&lt;/p&gt;

I can't even say it's &lt;i&gt;begun&lt;/i&gt; to suffer because it's entirely snowballed to the point where my inbox is insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day Lifehacker noted Andreas Klinger's blog posting on &lt;a href="http://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more"&gt;Don't drown in email! How to use Gmail more efficiently.&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a good read and got me thinking.  Unfortunately, I don't use the Gmail web interface and I doubt that it's use of stars and exclamation marks will really work across email clients.  I want something that's easy enough to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been using &lt;a href="http://freron.com/"&gt;MailMate&lt;/a&gt; and it has a nice way of treating Gmail labels like IMAP keywords so that you can tag emails, in MailMate, and have them labelled in Gmail.  The nice thing with this, unlike other non-Gmail normal IMAP providers is that you can tag a message and then delete it, and it will show up in the "folder" corresponding to that label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I created the following labels (in Gmail) and tags (in other IMAP accounts.. yes, I have a few scattered abroad):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; @ACTION: for things that need to be done or responded to
&lt;li&gt; @IMPORTANT: for really important things that need to be done or responded to ASAP (like today)
&lt;li&gt; @WAITING: for things I'm waiting on or expect a reply on, essentially things I'm waiting on a person for (needs to be reviewed weekly)
&lt;li&gt; @FOLLOWUP: for things I need to follow up on (such as things I've delegated, also needs to be reviewed weekly)
&lt;li&gt; @EVENTS: for upcoming events or trips, just so they are easily found
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how @WAITING and @FOLLOWUP will be treated differently.  For now, I'm going to try it this way and see if I use one more than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my goal is to look in the @ACTION folder (on the regular IMAP accounts, I have a smart mailbox in MailMate named after these keywords so that regardless of whether I'm using Gmail or not I get the same behaviour on all email accounts) once a day and deal with quick things, and try to empty out every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The @IMPORTANT stuff will need to be dealt with daily.  That's going to be the hard one.  But I'm going to have to set a time (like 3pm or something) where I have to clear this folder out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest, with the exception of @EVENTS (which should be cleared out after any said events), should be reviewed at the beginning of each week.  Before I used to do reviews on Friday, but that seems odd to me now as I'll be emailing a bunch of folks right before the weekend when they probably don't want to hear from me.  Better to catch them (hopefully!) fresh and chipper on a Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've cleaned out two out of my four emails.  They were the easiest of the two.  Inbox-zero for them both.  My work and primary personal accounts are two different stories, however, and will probably require some time this weekend to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many friends who have, quite literally, thousands of emails in their inbox.  How they manage to stay sane is beyond me.  Maybe if I can get a system that works and I can do consistently (that is my biggest challenge... taking those few seconds to just deal with things) then I can share it with them and they'll maybe realize what a crippling thing it is to have such horrendously large inboxes (and why it feels like their email is so slow.. seriously, I cannot make this make sense to them!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other tips from anyone out there on how to manage your email, or perhaps what clever things you do to manage your email?  Keep in mind that for my work I can quite easily get a few hundred emails in a day, so email is a very important and severely irritating part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="email"></category><category term="gmail"></category><category term="mailmate"></category></entry><entry><title>Merry Christmas!</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/merry-christmas" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-24T15:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-12-24T15:48:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2013-12-24:/blog/merry-christmas</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas to all my friends, family, co-workers, partners-in-crime, and just generally everyone else out there.

&lt;p&gt;Some code that I'm working on has a development branch which I'm working on while other fixes are being made to the master branch.  This is great, except for the fact that I need to apply any changes made to master to the development branch as well (we'll call it "feat/X").  And since I'm the only one working on feat/X, but others add fixes or necessary changes to master, I need to apply those changes.  Some changes will apply clean, others need to be modified due to one part that is receiving a major overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is probably a better way to do this and if so, please do let me know in the comments.  Even though I use git almost daily, I am by no means a power user and would love more "insider tips".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have my working copy, and I need it to know about both branches.  By default, if you clone the repository you'll just be on the master branch.  So in this case I would have to &lt;code&gt;git checkout feat/X&lt;/code&gt;.  Once I do that, I will see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% git branch
* feat/X
  master
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do a &lt;code&gt;git checkout master&lt;/code&gt; to switch back to the master branch.  From here we can make a series of patches that represent code changes made to master after feat/X was branched:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% git format-patch feat/X
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time you do this, all the patches will be new.  But as you move along, you'll continue to see these patches show up so it's useful to keep them kicking around so you know which are new.  You'll see patches in the format "0001-The-commit-text.patch" and "0002-Other-commit-text.patch".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I move the patches out of the way (I have horrid file management, so I just &lt;code&gt;mv *patch ~/&lt;/code&gt;).  Then &lt;code&gt;git checkout feat/X&lt;/code&gt; to switch to the feat/X branch.  Now we apply the patches one-by-one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% git am &lt;0001-The-commit-text.patch
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the patch is successful, you can do the same to the next.  If not, however, you need to fiddle with things a bit.  You'll see an error like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% git am &lt;~/0001-The-commit-text.patch
Applying: The commit text
error: patch failed: something/else.py:559
error: something/else.py: patch does not apply
Patch failed at 0001 The commit text
The copy of the patch that failed is found in:
   /home/vdanen/my-git-repo/.git/rebase-apply/patch
When you have resolved this problem, run "git am --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git am --skip" instead.
To restore the original branch and stop patching, run "git am --abort".
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run &lt;code&gt;git am --abort&lt;/code&gt; which will revert the commit attempt, to allow you to manually apply the patch and commit.  You can also use &lt;code&gt;git am --skip&lt;/code&gt; to do the same.  I suspect if you fed git something like &lt;code&gt;git am &amp;lt;~/*patch&lt;/code&gt; these commands would mean different things (abort the session versus skip the one patch) but if you're doing one patch at a time they both do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check the log output with &lt;code&gt;git log master..HEAD --stat&lt;/code&gt; which will show that our branch contains the update, along with the appropriate author information (might be you, might be me, might be someone else).  I tend to skip the log bit and just apply one patch at a time.  Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you don't move your patches like I did, you can use &lt;code&gt;git clean&lt;/code&gt; to remove the patches from your working directory.  Use '-n' first though, so it runs in dry-run mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I indicated earlier, there are probably simpler ways to do this, but this works for me.  I got all of this from &lt;a href="http://rypress.com/tutorials/git/patch-workflows.html"&gt;Ry's Git Tutorial on Patch Workflows&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I've been programming in Python for a few years now (I can pretty much mark the beginning because of starting at Red Hat).  Since picking it up, I've fallen in love with the language and have a few books on the subject.  One of the most indispensable books I have is Learning Python 3rd Edition published by O'Reilly.  Recently I received a copy of the 5th Edition for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction was that it was no mere book, but a tome.  The 3rd Edition was no slouch, weighing in at 700 pages, but the 5th Edition is a hefty 1540 pages, over twice the size!  This edition was released in June 2013 (ISBN 978-1-449-35573-9); the previous edition that I owned (the 3rd) was published in October 2007.  This new edition was updated to cover Python versions 3.3 and 2.7 (the 4th Edition covered 2.6 and 3.0/3.1, so I imagine it too had a hefty size increase over the 3rd Edition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go further with the review I have to note that Learning Python 3rd Edition is nearly always on my desk.  I referenced that book all the time.  With the number of alternatives out there (searching on the internet or looking at other books that I have, such as Programming Python, the Python Cookbook, and Python in a Nutshell), this is the one book I used all the time.  It is worn, crinkled, dirty, and probably sticky in a few spots as well.  However, I'm not one to read books like this from front to back -- I use them as reference material for areas that interest me or I need help with (or I need to brush up on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first section of the book, "Getting Started" goes into the basics of Python: what it is, what it's used for, how to use it, why you would use it, and so forth.  The 5th Edition expands on this, particular in regards to version 3.3 and its new options in Windows.  This is all the really basic stuff, explained quite well and great for those interested in getting into Python without a lot of knowledge of the language.  Those more experienced with Python will likely skip this section for the most part, but there are some good bits in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second section of the book, "Types and Operations", gets to the meat of writing code.  This is the section that talks about Python object types (lists, dictionaries, tuples), how Python handles numbers, dynamic typing, manipulating and using strings, and handling file operations.  One thing I noticed immediately is that the section dealing with numbers is greatly expanded from the 3rd Edition and this is largely due to the changes of how these are handled in Python 2.x vs 3.x.  It is in this chapter that you begin to see why the book is so hefty -- instead of focusing on just one major version of the language, it provides the necessary information for both 2.x and 3.x and the differences between the two.  Because Python 2.x is still so widely used, it would have been impossible to ignore it unless they decided to write two books, one for each major version.  The section on handling strings has likewise been expanded, enhanced, and re-organized with quite a bit of extra content.  Again, quite a bit of this is due to the coverage of both Python 2.x and 3.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third section of the book, "Statements and Syntax", gets into the fundamentals of handling your code: typical statements (if/elif/else, variable assignments, loop handling, creating functions, namespaces, module handling, and exception handling).  Here again a lot of content is devoted to the differences between 2.x and 3.x, and even between different versions of 2.x.  There is a lot of content here -- chapters devoted to topics about looping, if statements, iteration and comprehension, the 2.x print statement versus the 3.x print function, and even how to generate documentation for your code using PyDoc.  For those learning Python, and even for those who choose to use this book as a reference, this section will be greatly used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most significantly changed sections between the two editions of Learning Python (again, noting that I've never looked at the 4th Edition so I don't know how significant a change it is between the 4th and 5th editions), is what was "Functions" in the 3rd edition is now "Functions and Generators" in the 5th Edition.  There is a significant overhaul between the two: where before "Scopes and Arguments" were a single chapter, we now have two chapters, one devoted to each topic; the 33 page chapter has turned into 67 pages spanning two chapters.  It also goes into great detail about generator functions and expressions (something I have yet to fully explore).  Suffice it to say, there is a good 45 pages of new content here that will prove interesting to read (list comprehension, generators, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth section, "Modules and Packages" likewise contains greatly expanded content covering the use of modules, how to create them, why (and how) you should use them, the differences between importing and reloading modules, full coverage of Python 3.3 namespace packages, problems you can encounter with module use, and so forth.  It talks about the features common to both major versions of Python, and has sections that are more specific, such as how byte code is handled (.pyc in versions prior to 3.2 and the &lt;strong&gt;pycache&lt;/strong&gt; directory in 3.2+) and namespace packages that were introduced in 3.3 (which is also shows the differences between regular packages and namespace packages).  This once again shows the level of detail the book provides for users of any version of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section six is all about Object-Oriented Programming and classes, and gives great detail and examples on topics such as polymorphism, classes and subclasses, object handling, operator overloading, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section seven goes into the how's and why's of exceptions and how to use them to write good error-handling in your code.  This is the last section that appears in both editions, although (as with every other section), this one is greatly expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new section in the 5th Edition, compared to the 3rd, is the "Advanced Topics" section and its five chapters.  This section goes into unicode and byte strings -- an area that has seen a lot of changes between Python 2.x and 3.x, as well as managed attributes, decorators for functions and classes, metaclasses and the differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I've not yet read the entire book and chances are I never will.  Most of these programming books I never do read end-to-end, but I do use them as functional references and to learn new things from (pretty much the entire "Advanced Topics" section is new to me), as well as to brush up on older things.  From the parts I've read, and the comparisons I've made to the 3rd edition, this is most definitely a worthwhile "upgrade".  One thing I appreciate as well is the consistent back-and-forth regarding Python 2.x versus 3.x.  As a Python coder who has never yet touched Python 3.x, this book will help me understand the subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, nuances between both major versions -- when the time comes (aka: when the time is available).  As such, this book is valuable to me now (writing code in Python 2.x) and will be valuable to me in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly appreciate the expanded content, as it's already twigged a few things in my mind about the code I've written so far, and has given me some new ideas on how to handle certain issues or improve performance/handling of my code.  This is both good and dangerous!  Having said that, this is most definitely a book worth getting for any Python programmer who either is new to the language or is a veteran of the language -- the first will appreciate the no-nonsense easy-to-understand approach to introducing both the basics and some quite advanced topics, while the latter will appreciate it as a reference book or to expand on their understanding of certain topics.  For myself, I'm somewhere in the middle of the two and this book is introducing me to a lot of stuff I do not yet know, and is a very handy reference for the stuff that I do know (and need reminders of every once in a while).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've highly recommended the 3rd edition of this book to anyone asking about good books on Python, and the 5th Edition is no different.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants more than just a passing understanding of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a replacement for my well-worn and well-loved 3rd Edition, I know this book will see much use from me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Real-world SSD vs HDD: cvs2svn speed</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/real-world-ssd-vs-hdd-cvs2svn-speed" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-20T09:03:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-08-20T09:03:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2013-08-20:/blog/real-world-ssd-vs-hdd-cvs2svn-speed</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This just absolutely blew my mind so I figured I'd post a quick note about it.

I have to convert a CVS repository to SVN and this is a big repository, over 33k commits to it spanning a decade.  In my trial runs, using cvs2svn resulted in it taking just shy of 11.5hrs to complete, on the HDD (I have an SSD in my workstation for everything and a 2TB HDD for storage and scratch space which is where I was running the conversion).  Moving the original raw CVS repository into a temporary directory on the SSD and running cvs2svn from there (reading from and writing to the SSD) resulted in 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come again?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right... 19 &lt;i&gt;minutes&lt;/i&gt;.  Moving from the HDD to an SSD dropped the conversion from 11.5hrs to 19 &lt;i&gt;minutes&lt;/i&gt;.  I expected a speed-up, but I did not expect it to be this drastic.  It makes me wonder how much faster having my Fedora mirror on an SSD would be when doing rq imports.  There I have the MySQL database on the SSD, but all the rpms are being read/unpacked on the large HDD.  Importing can be slow, given the size of Fedora (queries to the database is really fast).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my Fedora/CentOS mirror is almost 800GB and that would be a very expensive purchase.

Tiny little boxes full of storage and ripe for mucking with since for the most part they run Linux make me all warm and fuzzy and just generally put me in a good mood.  Probably because I'm a bit of a digital packrat, so I like having gobs of storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've played with different NAS units over the years: the D-Link DNS-323 was a favourite for a while due to it's high hackability, and I've used the Iomega Storcenter ix2-200 (it's not awful, but not great).  I did some consulting for a friend's company earlier this year and setup a QNAP for them for off-site backups, and when the backup box at my mom's died I picked up a QNAP for myself (I like these QNAPs; very familiar md-based RAID and really quite feature-rich, easier to muck about it in than the DNS-323 I found).  The same friend also had two Drobo units at his office, connected via FW800 to a Mac Mini (so two big storage volumes).  When I first popped in, one of the units had a failed drive that needed replacing, and within the following 2-3mos, another drive in each unit had died.  Zero-dataloss in both cases, which impressed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking the backup box from my mom's that I replaced with the QNAP, I played a bit with FreeNAS (I've never played with ZFS before so it seemed like a good excuse).  I like FreeNAS -- those guys did some excellent work on it, but after doing a bunch of reading I'm glad I went with the QNAP at my mom's rather than building a new FreeNAS-based box to put there.  And it didn't seem like the right fit for what I wanted at home (lots of storage with a small footprint, low power usage, and not necessarily having all the bells and whistles that I didn't need).  As a result, I did some reading up on the Drobo 5N which sounded like a perfect fit, and having had played with those other two Drobo units, seemed like it could be exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drobo 5N is a NAS unit (so only takes power and ethernet as far as "peripherals" go.  It's a Linux-based system as well, which meant I could poke around and make it do interesting things.  I also like that it can take an mSATA SSD for a caching accelerator, making writing to the device much faster.  I also really like that I can hot-swap the drives easily.  No downtime, no dataloss, what's not to like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I picked one up and loaded it with five drives and a 128GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll dispense with the typical "unboxing" that you tend to find, and get right down to making it more usable.  Out of the box, the Drobo does SMB/CIFS and AFP, so it works good for OS X and Windows.  NFS is available through the &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/a/droboports.com/www/"&gt;DroboPorts&lt;/a&gt; site, but after fiddling with it for a bit (and it might just be a quirk of this version or I did something wrong), I wasn't able to write to the shares (only read), so I instead went with using CIFS to mount this thing from Linux instead.  When a new version of NFS is available for it maybe I'll try it again.  For now, CIFS works pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first steps to make this thing a bit more usable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/a/droboports.com/www/app-repository/openssh-6-1"&gt;openssh&lt;/a&gt;.  This will allow you to log remotely into the Drobo unit.  A few things to note: 1) you will need to copy the openssh.tgz to the DroboApps share and then reboot, at which point openssh will get installed and will start, 2) any users defined will by default have access via ssh to the Drobo, 3) root has access with the default password "root" (please please please change this ASAP!), 4) the defined administrator user's username is Admin, not admin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have openssh installed and can ssh into the box, you can install &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/a/droboports.com/www/app-repository/sudo-1-8-5p3"&gt;sudo&lt;/a&gt;.  You'll need to install it as root (or as Admin, and then login as root and chown everything to root).  The app instructions indicate to setup a sudo group, etc. but unless you have more than one user it's probably unnecessary.  You can simply edit the sudoers file to give your Admin user sudo access, or a chosen other user (say, joe or mary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two I find pretty much critical to install, but some other essential apps to add would be rsync, vim, curl, and nfs (assuming you can make the latter work better than I could).  Other nice apps that are available include git and openvpn.  You can even install apache and mysql on this thing if you were so inclined (as well as php, python, ruby, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because none of these will be in your $PATH, you'll need to follow these &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/a/droboports.com/www/using-command-line-apps"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to get these things in your $PATH if you want to use them easily when you ssh in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've done all of this, the final steps would be to 1) change the root password if you have not already done so, 2) copy an ssh public key to the drobo and make sure it works for password-less authentication, 3) turn off password-based authentication to the Drobo via editing /mnt/DroboFS/Shares/DroboApps/openssh/etc/sshd_config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I'm pleased with this unit.  I loaded it with 2x4TB, 2x3TB, and 1x1.5TB (the latter simply because I pulled it from a de-commissioned box and didn't want to waste the drive), and it gave me 10TB of usable space, which is pretty good.  In this configuration it will tolerate one dead drive.  The data on here isn't critical enough for me to enable the dual-drive-fail mode (which would drop the usable space to just upwards of 6TB; I care more about the space than the redundancy for what's going to be stored on it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the various consumer NAS boxes I've used, the Drobo is by far the most simplistic. But what it does, it does extremely well.  The QNAP is my second choice.  But since my Linux boxen take care of all the other extras that these things provide, the Drobo 5N and its more simplistic interface/feature-set really met my needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="drobo"></category></entry><entry><title>Of bugzilla, python, fetchmail, and procmail</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/of-bugzilla-python-fetchmail-and-procmail" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-08T14:31:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-06-08T14:31:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2013-06-08:/blog/of-bugzilla-python-fetchmail-and-procmail</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been working with bugzilla for years.. at Mandriva I was the primary bugzilla care-taker for a few years, and now with Red Hat I do a lot of work on some internal tools that interface with bugzilla that enhances and directs the workflow of day-to-day work (being that we …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been working with bugzilla for years.. at Mandriva I was the primary bugzilla care-taker for a few years, and now with Red Hat I do a lot of work on some internal tools that interface with bugzilla that enhances and directs the workflow of day-to-day work (being that we work with bugzilla all the time).  I also run my own bugzilla instance a) so I can keep up to date with the goings-on of bugzilla and b) so I can track various things in some of the scripts I write and other stuff.  One thing that I do is also use it as a way of logging issues that may come up with the various bits of web hosting that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I needed was a way to take incoming emails generated by lfd (my primary concern right now is high load average warnings; I wanted to log them to bugzilla so that if I'm unavailable my dad could also see them (he helps maintain the server and hosts a bunch of his stuff there as well) and perhaps deal with them or at the very least if he wanted/needed to comment on them he could do so via bugzilla, and I can also make note of resolutions or causes, etc.  Yes, I'm turning bugzilla into a poor man's "RT" ticketing system (I have no interest in setting something like that up, I'm already using bugzilla, and this is the best place for me to stuff these sorts of notes).  I've tried the email_in.pl method and while it works, it only works if you have a specific format so you can assign it to the right component and product -- not something that will work with these lfd-generated emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that a lot of the work that I've been doing has to do with using python and xmlrpc to manipulate bugs in the Red Hat bugzilla, it seemed like a reasonable approach to take to deal with my own bug mangling.  The problem is that these emails were being sent to root, which in turn forwards directly to me.  I also wanted to keep a copy of those mails in my own mailbox in case bugzilla, or anything in between, did something funky, so I opted to do a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; use a gmail filter to forward those emails to another email account specifically for bugzilla mails
&lt;li&gt; setup fetchmail to pull (via pop3) those emails
&lt;li&gt; setup procmail to filter those emails and send them to a helper script
&lt;li&gt; write a helper script that will then call the &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/python-bugzilla"&gt;python-bugzilla&lt;/a&gt; tool to file the bug
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step was easy.  Fetchmail was pretty easy too (although it's been a few years).  Procmail was easy, particularly now since I'm only concerned with one particular type of email and my gmail filter is quite specific.  The helper script was initially a shell script that was going to call the bugzilla script but I quickly found limitations to that, particular since lfd's email also has a few attachments and I was having issues with getting it to file the bugs properly.  So instead of using uudeview and a shell script, I opted to write something in python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of procmail feeding uudeview and then feeding my script, I made use of some of the features of python that allow for manipulating email messages (something I've never done before).  I also found that passing stdin to the python script was somehow also passing stdin to python-bugzilla when I was calling it, which was causing all kinds of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this script I learned all kinds of new things: how to manipulate an email message in python and reduce an email with attachments to a message body with individual attachments as objects and how to use subprocess (yes, I'm still using the commands stuff by and large, but that was really problematic with stdin being persistent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all it works quite well.  However, I do still have one problem that I've not yet liked, and that is with binary files.  I'm not sure where the issue is coming from, but for some reason when I call python-bugzilla myself, in a shell, and feed it the file to attach to the bug it works fine -- however, when I call it from my script (so no shell), it uses the --file argument as the name of the file and wants stdin as the contents of the file.  This is all fine and dandy, but somewhere along the line something is rendering that binary file (was testing with a jpeg) into text and when it's attached to the bug it has the right mime type, but the contents are wrong and no image is displayed.  So, dear lazy web, if there any python folks out there who want to look at my script and tell me what I'm doing wrong, I'd be much obliged.... =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, since no post like this is really any good without the files involved, what follows is the script (process-mail) and the .procmailrc file (which is pretty bare bones and doesn't filter much of anything):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# .procmailrc
#

HOME="/home/mailer"
SHELL=/bin/sh
VERBOSE=off
LOGFILE=$HOME/.procmail/procmail.log
# inserts a blank line between log entries
LOG="
"

:0
*^content-Type:
{
    :0fw
    | /usr/bin/python $HOME/bin/process-mail
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this does is call the process-mail script.  It will/may eventually filter on subject and sender if I find that unwanted emails are triggering new bugs.  For the moment I don't particularly care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the process-mail python script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

if bug != '':
    log.write('Filed bug %s\n' % bug)

        log.write('Found attachment: %s\n' % attachment)
        cmd = [bz_prog, bz_dest, 'attach', '--file=%s' % x, '--type=%s' % attachments[x], '--desc=mail attachment: %s' % x, bug.strip('\n')]

        else:
            # this does not work.. attaching a jpg results in mangled text and I'm not sure why...
            a_file = open(attachment, 'rb')
        foo = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdin=a_file, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0]
        a_file.close()

        if foo != '':
            log.write(foo + '\n')
        else:
            log.write('Failed to attach bug to bugzilla!\n')

log.close()

sys.exit(0)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why this isn't working for binary attachments though... it's probably something simple, but I've not had a chance to figure out what the problem is.

Previous posts talked about pulling parts of a subversion repository into a git repo -- effectively taking one svn repo apart into multiple git repos.  This time I just needed to do a straight conversion, however I needed to exclude one single directory from ever being a part of the history of the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was a fairly important repo to convert, I did a few trial runs first and ended up scripting it since there isn't just a single command to do what I needed.  Essentially, we are doing a git clone from a subversion repository (a standard one with trunk/, tags/, branches/ this time), but excluding one directory (we'll call it private).  I also wanted to convert the svn branches to tags since that's effectively what they were.  Also, since the git repository was not local, and for the sake of expediency I didn't want to tar something up and email it, we're taking our converted-and-cleaned-up new git repo, changing the upstream, and then pushing the whole thing to a remote bare repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready?  (Note: a few lines are manually wrapped with '\' below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
WORKDIR="/srv/svn2git/git"
REMOTE="git+ssh://remote.git.host/myrepo.git"
mkdir -p ${WORKDIR}

pushd ${WORKDIR}
git svn clone https://remote.svn.host/repos/myrepo --no-metadata \
  -A /srv/svn2git/authors-transform.txt --stdlayout \
  --ignore-paths="^trunk/private" ${WORKDIR}/from-svn
cd from-svn
git init --bare ../bare.git
cd ../bare.git
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/trunk
cd ../from-svn
git remote add bare ../bare.git
git config remote.bare.push 'refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*'
git push bare
cd ../bare.git
git branch -m trunk master
for x in branch_one branch_two branch_three; do
    git tag "${x}" refs/heads/${x}
    git branch -D ${x}
done

cd ..
git clone bare.git myrepo
cd myrepo
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin ${REMOTE}
git config remote.origin.push 'refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*'
git config master.remote origin
git config master.merge refs/head/master
git push --set-upstream origin master
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is all there was too it.  The svn authors file was created ny using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ svn log -q | awk -F '|' '/^r/ {sub("^ ", "", $2); sub(" $", "", $2); \
print $2" = "$2" &lt;"$2"&gt;"}' | sort -u &gt; authors-transform.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the existing copy of the subversion repository that I had (and then mangling it to suit my needs, particularly changing it to add the committers' real names and email addresses as well).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>I'm FedUp with Fedora!</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/im-fedup-with-fedora" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-03T00:19:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-02-03T00:19:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2013-02-03:/blog/im-fedup-with-fedora</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry, couldn't resist.  =)&lt;/p&gt;

Usually it works pretty good.  I didn't really have much good experience with PreUpgrade the few times I tried it, so I wanted to give &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedUp"&gt;FedUp&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my Parallels Fedora 17 VM it worked amazingly well.  So decided to try it on my laptop, which is also running Fedora 17.  I think it makes sense to do a little bit of house-keeping before running it though, and the FedUp page doesn't mention any of this (perhaps it's no longer needed?).  Anyways, a few steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum install rpmconf; rpmconf -a&lt;/code&gt; (review any .rpmnew/.rpmsave files, merge changes as required)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;find /etc /var -name '&lt;em&gt;?.rpm?&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; (find any other old .rpmnew/.rpmsave files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum install yum-utils; package-cleanup --leaves&lt;/code&gt; (review and remove any unused packages, not all will be removable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;package-cleanup --orphans&lt;/code&gt; (find and remove any orphan packages no longer in the repositories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can run FedUp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum install fedup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fedup-cli --network 18 --debuglog /root/fedupdebug.log&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this completes without error (check the log), you can reboot.  At grub you'll see a "System Upgrade" entry.  When that's done, it'll reboot into Fedora 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wiki page talks about upgrading GRUB2 since you'll be booting from Fedora 17's GRUB2.  If you've got a BIOS-based system, you can use the &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GRUB_2#Updating_GRUB_2_configuration_on_BIOS_systems"&gt;Updating GRUB2 configuration on BIOS systems&lt;/a&gt; instructions.  For those using UEFI, instructions are on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also want to run &lt;code&gt;package-cleanup --orphans&lt;/code&gt; after you do the upgrade as well, just to get rid of any other leftovers.  The only issue I discovered so far with the upgrade is that Google Chrome didn't work out-of-the-box.  However, doing a &lt;code&gt;yum remove google-chrome-stable; yum install google-chrome&lt;/code&gt; got that sorted out (although it did install the unstable version; the stable version had issues with missing libraries and wouldn't load).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, upgrading from Fedora 17 to 18 went a heck of a lot smoother than a fresh install did.  I also got to see what the new GDM/GNOME looks like (quite nice, actually, although I think I'll give MATE a try on the laptop as well because, while GNOME3 is pretty, I definitely preferred GNOME2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good job, Fedora-folks!  Now I just have to upgrade my main workstation, but I think I'm going to play on the laptop for a bit before taking that step.

I use Fedora 17 on a laptop and a desktop, but I also have copies in virtual machines that I use for testing -- these virtual machines run in VMware Fusion on my Mac Pro.  So never having used Fedora 18 during any of the betas or anything, first thing I did was try to install it in VMware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the new Anaconda UI.  One of the things I appreciated about Anaconda in the past is that it was easy to use, but didn't prevent me from doing "power things", like partitioning disks the way I wanted to partition them.  This seems to no longer be the case, and Anaconda does a lot of hand-holding.  It has been a habit to go through the list of packages to be installed (select a group, then go through and weed out the stuff I don't want), so things I don't want don't even touch the disk.  Doesn't seem like I can do this anymore either.  I don't agree with some reviewers who seem to think the UI change is to make it look/feel more mobile or "touchscreen-like", but I do feel it's dumbed down quite a bit which makes me unhappy.  I lived with it, until trying to change the partition layout killed Anaconda.  Twice.  After that I decided to let it do what it wanted since it was just a VM and I didn't care enough to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Fedora gets installed and lo!  A nice blue screen where I can do absolutely &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;.  No icons, no text, no login box, nothing.  Afterwards I read this has to do with having 3D graphics enabled in VMware (but at that point I had already reinstalled to use LXDE rather than GNOME, so I've not tried anything regarding that, however I did find &lt;a href="http://www.greebo.net/2013/01/18/installing-fedora-18-rtm-to-vmware-fusion-5-or-vmware-workstation-9/"&gt;this blog posting about Fedora 18 in VMware Fusion 5/VMware Workstation 9&lt;/a&gt; which explains things a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my home network I run IPA on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to handle my Kerberos/LDAP auth duties.  This means when I install an operating system, no matter what it is, I don't create local users.  So when I installed Fedora 18, I only have the root user and the rest come from IPA.  A few problems with that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Setting up IPA in Anaconda does not work
&lt;li&gt; Post-install, logging in as root at the GUI is not permitted
&lt;li&gt; I have a grub error on tty2, not a login (and nothing on tty3 for that matter)
&lt;li&gt; I have to reboot and edit grub to add &lt;b&gt;systemd.unit=multi-user.target&lt;/b&gt; to boot into the console to get a tty (see &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Systemd#Boot_Kernel_Command_Line"&gt;Systemd: Boot Kernel Command Line&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;li&gt; After I install freeipa-client, I can enroll in the domain
&lt;li&gt; SSSD is not enabled when you install it!  Once again I have to reboot to the console
&lt;li&gt; Enable SSSD and reboot, only to find that once again I cannot login as a user in the GUI (that I could login as on the console)
&lt;li&gt; Head-scratching moment when I realize I know next to nothing about systemd and can only conclude that perhaps NetworkManager starts upon login in the graphical boot and not at system start, which prevents SSSD from talking to IPA to confirm my login
&lt;li&gt; Looking at &lt;i&gt;/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-eth0&lt;/i&gt; tells me that perhaps that is not the case
&lt;li&gt; Big WTF moment and go to bed
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I am unhappy with Fedora 18.  I suppose that on bare metal it probably works better.  I also suppose that with a real user account it works better.  At this point I don't want to do yet another reinstall because then I have to remove the host from IPA and re-enroll, which is annoying (and I really don't want to revisit Anaconda either -- I'll get to do that when I create the 64bit Fedora 18 VM later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, after a few days I tried a few other things.  The first was getting rid of NetworkManager thinking that perhaps it would only start when I login (which I can't, if there is no network, because my login is IPA-based).  So I had to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# systemctl disable NetworkManager.service
# systemctl enable network.service
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most annoying thing, however, is that when I boot into graphical mode, I get no gettys.  I'm pretty sure I told systemd that I want three of them (I have three symlinks in /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants: getty@tty1.service through getty@tty3.service; sadly when I boot into graphical mode and switch to TTY2, I get a grub error message and nothing on TTY3... what the heck?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I did was disable SELinux.  In multi-user.target, I can login as my IPA-user no problem.  With LXDM, however, I never could (assuming, perhaps incorrectly, that network initialization was delayed).  But upon further inspection I see a lot of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
lxdm-binary: pam_selinux(lxdm:session): Setting key creation contect guest_u:guest_r:oddjob_mkhomedir_t:s0 failed: Permission denied
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have zero interest and zero time in making SELinux work with LXDM and since this is a virtual machine, I don't care if SELinux is disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, I can now log into LXDM.  In light of the SELinux thing, I'm thinking that NetworkManager is not to blame (silly me, I made two changes then rebooted -- it could be either one, but I strongly suspect SELinux).  Maybe it would have worked better with GNOME (will try that on the next VM I install).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another side note, since I use VMWare Fusion for the VM, for the tools install (probably the same for the latest VMware Workstation as well, etc.), you may want to check out &lt;a href="http://communities.vmware.com/message/2178685"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.  In particular, seems like linux/version.h is missing and makes the tools angry.  The fix is easy though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# cd /usr/src/kernels/[current_version]/include
# cp generated/uapi/linux/version.h linux/
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can compile the tools.  IIRC, you'll also &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to use the i686 PAE kernel (doesn't seem to work on older versions, I suspect the same may be true with F18).  Easy enough to yum remove the PAE kernels and install the regular kernel.  YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the next day I installed Fedora 18 64-bit in VMWare Fusion.  With the lessons learned above, it was a lot less painful.  I still am not a big fan of Anaconda... I like the look of it, but the practical "working" bits of it definitely need some work.  I don't like that you can pick only one group of packages.  What if I want both GNOME desktop and a working web server?  Doesn't seem like it can be done.  I also like picking through individual packages and sorely miss that -- makes for having to install a bunch of stuff later.  Also not sure why vim isn't installed by default... I think this is the first time ever I've seen "vim: command not found".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, despite getting the VMware tools installed, if you want GDM to present you with anything, you need to disable 3D graphics.  I have it enabled on my 32-bit VM (which is using LXDM, works fine), but on the 64-bit VM (using GDM), even with vmware-tools compiled and running, I needed to disable 3D graphic acceleration.  I suppose there is a bug in the driver and/or X there.  Not a big deal to disable since I've done "yum groupinstall 'MATE Desktop'" (what need do I have for 3D graphics?  BTW, MATE is &lt;i&gt;sweet&lt;/i&gt;!) and now GDM loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPA still would not work to configure from Anaconda.  Definitely a bug to be filed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, time to end this.  This entry has been in the works for about two weeks (sadly, I've not had time to finish it or get my Fedora VM's running until yesterday, and finished up the 64-bit install this morning).  So far the install of Fedora 18, in VMware, has been a bit of a PITA.  Next order of business is to see how the upgrade works... I've got a Fedora 17 install in Parallels to upgrade to make sure all my work-related bits work, before attempting to upgrade on bare metal.  I'm quite certain that a lot of this can be attributed to the virtual machines and it'll work better on bare metal.  I'm also happy that those won't be fresh installs, so I don't have to deal with Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="fedora"></category><category term="ipa"></category><category term="vmware"></category></entry><entry><title>Converting a VMware Fusion virtual machine to KVM</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/converting-a-vmware-fusion-virtual-machine-to-kvm" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-27T15:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-01-27T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2013-01-27:/blog/converting-a-vmware-fusion-virtual-machine-to-kvm</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been running an instance of my Nagios XI monitor in a VMware Fusion virtual machine on my (aging) Mac Pro.

The other day I found a blog post on &lt;a href="http://www.held.org.il/blog/2012/04/how-i-converted-vmware-vm-to-kvm/"&gt;How I converted a VMware VM to KVM&lt;/a&gt; and since my new LAN server is a beefy 8-core AMD FX-8120 with 32GB RAM (as opposed to the 2 x 2.66GHz dual-core Xeon with 16GB RAM that is my 5(?) year old Mac Pro), I decided to try moving the VMware Fusion VM to running on my Linux server (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 with KVM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to be redundant on the steps noted in the other blog post, but to be a bit more explicit, we'll just go through the steps as I did notice a few errors (I'm assuming that blog post was written on some version of Ubuntu; I'm of course using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 host).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog notes to run the &lt;i&gt;qemu-img convert&lt;/i&gt; command on the non-wildcard vmdk file; however, I found that I needed to convert the multi-file image into a single disk image first, before it could be converted.  This may be the case for VMware Workstation disk images as well, however keep in mind we're using VMware Fusion 5 on OS X, so the tool we want is inside the VMware Fusion application bundle (specifically, we want the &lt;i&gt;vmware-vdiskmanager&lt;/i&gt; program).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before converting, however, I strongly recommend removing any existing snapshots of the virtual machine.  The first time I did this, I got the original snapshot which had the guest running CentOS 5.6 (and I updated it to 5.9 this morning before starting this).  So before converting anything, you probably need to remove any existing snapshots first.  Then, on the mac, convert this multi-file image into a single image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cd /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library
$ ./vmware-vdiskmanager -r ~/Documents/nagiosxi.vmwarevm/nagiosxi.vmdk \
    -t 0 ~/Desktop/nagiosxi.vmdk

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also gets rid of all of the extra VMware stuff like snapshots, etc.  Copy this new vmdk file, as well as the vmx file in the container, to the Linux box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, convert the new image file to QCOW2 format (the original blog post didn't specify the output format; qemu-img defaults to a raw file which we don't want, we want QCOW2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#  qemu-img convert nagiosxi.vmdk -O qcow2 /srv/virt/images/nagiosxi.img
# ls /srv/virt/images/nagiosxi.img -l
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 10737418240 Jan 27 08:33 /srv/virt/images/nagiosxi.img

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems more reasonable.  But we need to change permissions so that libvirt can read it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# chown qemu:qemu /srv/virt/images/nagiosxi.img
# chmod 600 /srv/virt/images/nagiosxi.img

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to use the &lt;i&gt;vmware2libvirt&lt;/i&gt; script to convert the vmx file to an XML file for libvirt.  Unfortunately, this only seems to ship with Ubuntu.  Fortunately, we can grab the script from &lt;a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-virt/virt-goodies/trunk/view/head:/vmware2libvirt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It's just a python script with no dependencies, so run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# python vmware2libvirt -f nagiosxi.vmwarevm/nagiosxi.vmx &gt;~/nagiosxi.xml

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we use virsh to import it.  Unfortunately, in this step, virsh is looking for &lt;i&gt;/usr/bin/kvm&lt;/i&gt; and the binary is actually installed as &lt;i&gt;/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm&lt;/i&gt;, so we need to make a symlink first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#  ln -s /usr/libexec/qemu-kvm /usr/bin/kvm
# virsh -c qemu:///system define ~/nagiosxi.xml

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will import the &lt;i&gt;nagiosxi.xml&lt;/i&gt; file to &lt;i&gt;/etc/libvirt/qemu/nagiosxi.xml&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original blog post talked about using the virt-manager GUI to finalize things, and since I'm lazy and don't know libvirt well enough to do all this on the commandline, we'll do the same thing.  Since that machine runs headless without a GUI, I need to ssh in as root with X forwarding and run virt-manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the GUI, I can see my nagiosxi VM defined, so I select it and edit the virtual machine details.  I need to remove the existing IDE Disk 1 (which points to the vmdk file) and add my converted image file.  Essentially:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; "Add Hardware" -&gt; "Storage" -&gt; "Managed or other existing storage" -&gt; Pick your new file
&lt;li&gt; Select "Storage Format" -&gt; Pick qcow2
&lt;li&gt; Click "Finish"
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also want to add a few more bits of hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Serial&lt;/b&gt;: Device type: pty
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Network&lt;/b&gt;: Host device: br0, Device model: virtio
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, there was no network device, and the serial console is useful for using commands like "virsh console" (but you have to setup the serial getty inside the VM for this to work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to startup the new virtual machine.  Once you have gotten it up and running, you'll want to remove the vmware-tools that were installed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="kvm"></category><category term="vmware"></category></entry><entry><title>Replaced my Kerberos+LDAP setup with FreeIPA</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/replaced-my-kerberosldap-setup-with-freeipa" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-12-12T20:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-12-12T20:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2012-12-12:/blog/replaced-my-kerberosldap-setup-with-freeipa</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I've been having to deal with some IPA-related bugs in the past little bit, which of course got me thinking that I had no idea what IPA did or how to use it (thankfully I wasn't responsible for fixing the bugs!).

But as I had to deal with this issues to some degree, I got to figure out what FreeIPA was and what it did.  In short, FreeIPA &lt;b&gt;rocks&lt;/b&gt;.  As many of you know, I've written quite a few articles and blog posts about using Kerberos or OpenLDAP for authentication.  It's no secret that I make heavy use of Linux at home, but also of the Mac, so for me any solution needs to deal with both in a semi-reasonable way.  I could do Kerberos auth on OS X easily enough, but never did have luck with LDAP.  On Linux, it's a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using Kerberos and LDAP at home for years, largely because I have to do a lot of testing of things in virtual machines, so when a new version of something comes out (new Fedora, new major version of RHEL, etc.), I spin up a new VM and install it.  Using Kerberos and LDAP make the setup a breeze, and if I change my password, I'm not changing it on 20-odd systems/virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to say that FreeIPA exceeded my expectations, despite a bit of a rocky start (due to my not reading enough of the docs, annoyingly enough).  I've now got it in place, it's doing Kerberos+LDAP on the Linux clients and &lt;b&gt;also&lt;/b&gt; on the Macs!  I have, for the first time ever (not counting OS X server 10.4 or something, and using OpenDirectory), gotten to login to an OS X system with network credentials.  I've also made use of the DogTag CA and had my internal mediawiki instance (which used mod_auth_kerb for SSO authentication) also use HTTPS now with mod_nss and my shiny new IPA CA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a bunch more about FreeIPA than what I've done so far.  I've just scratched the surface (and even that, not entirely as I've still got a dozen or so systems/vms to switch from the old Kerberos+LDAP setup to using FreeIPA), but I'm looking forward to playing with the other things like a hopefully much easier kerberized NFSv4, storing sudo configs in the directory, auto-mounted home directories (don't care too much about that for the workstations but that will be &lt;i&gt;sweet&lt;/i&gt; for the virtual machines), and so on.  FreeIPA has a really really nice package that takes care of all this stuff and I'm kinda kicking myself that I didn't play with it sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, because of my really odd love for this sort of thing, I've written an article on my wiki: &lt;a href="/Using_FreeIPA_for_User_Authentication"&gt;Using FreeIPA for User Authentication&lt;/a&gt; which goes into the whole setup and enrolment.  A lot of it is covered in the upstream docs, but the upstream docs only got to OS X 10.4, so my 10.7/10.8 setup required a bit more futzing and research.  While I'm "officially" calling this article done, as I spend time over the Christmas holidays playing around with it, I will no doubt be adding more info as I discover it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="ipa"></category><category term="kerberos"></category><category term="ldap"></category></entry><entry><title>Git commit hook to bugzilla using git-notifier</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/git-commit-hook-to-bugzilla-using-git-notifier" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-21T18:49:00-06:00</published><updated>2012-09-21T18:49:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2012-09-21:/blog/git-commit-hook-to-bugzilla-using-git-notifier</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of the &lt;a href="http://www.icir.org/robin/git-notifier/"&gt;git-notifier&lt;/a&gt; script, which acts as a hook in git to send you nice emails about things that have changed in your git repos.

I'm also a bugzilla user, so I wanted to be able to put git commit notifications, automatically, in bugzilla if "bug #X" is in the commit log.  Initially I was intending to use &lt;a href="http://www.theoldmonk.net/gitzilla/"&gt;gitzilla&lt;/a&gt; for this, but I didn't feel like attempting to make it work with the latest release of &lt;a href="https://github.com/williamh/pybugz"&gt;pybugz&lt;/a&gt; (says it is tested with version 0.8.0 but the current version is 0.10.1.  In retrospect, that might have actually been easier.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I decided to use git-notifier to send an email to bugzilla (while gitzilla uses XMLRPC, which would have been preferable, I also have incoming email support enabled in bugzilla).  It took some trial and error, but I got it working (although I suspect there are easier ways to do it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I had to do was patch git-notifier to accept a bug id, because bugzilla needs to know what bug to route the incoming email to.  This was very easy to do (I'll be sending this upstream to see if they want to include it, but I may also change it to pull more info from the git config so that the post-receive hook doesn't have to be so obscene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(lines wrapped for readability)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while it's fugly, there's quite a bit of magic to it.  Seems that when you call git-notifier again, it won't send an email because it knows it's already been sent, which is why we need the commit hash, and feed it to it with the --manual option.  The --mailinglist option is used to point to bugzilla (again, the git-notifier config is pointing to another email address to receive the commits already, so we need to override it).  The --sender option takes the committer's email address as the value (the $EMAIL variable), which also overrides the default git-notifier sender (which is the local user on the system unless you're using gitolite (which I'm not)).  The --bug_id is a digit to reference the bug in the commit (this should also send multiple mails if more than one bug is referenced in the commit, but I've not tested that yet).  The end result is you get a copy of the git commit directly into bugzilla, in the same format that you would get it via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may spend some time later on trying to make gitzilla play nicely with the newer version of pybugz, but for now this scratches my itch.  Like I said, not the prettiest solution, but it works as a quick-n-dirty hack.  The inspiration for using email to send this to bugzilla was from Gentoo's &lt;a href="http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Bugzilla_Email#Subversion_Integration"&gt;Bugzilla Email&lt;/a&gt; wiki entry (the subversion integration part in particular).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that since the email is being sent as the committer, the committer needs to have an account with that email address in your bugzilla.  If not, bugzilla's email_in.pl will bounce it back.  So you may want to have a bugzilla "commits" account as a dummy account from which you can email these things if not all of your committers have bugzilla access or use the same email address in bugzilla that they do in git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any suggestions on a better way to do this (particularly via XMLRPC which I think would be a nicer way to go), I'm all ears.  (Short of writing my own -- I could do this, having worked with bugzilla and lately with XMLRPC access, quite a bit -- I'm too lazy to write something from scratch)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="bugzilla"></category><category term="git"></category></entry><entry><title>Apache mod_rewrite frustration</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/apache-mod_rewrite-frustration" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-05-05T16:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2012-05-05T16:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2012-05-05:/blog/apache-mod_rewrite-frustration</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear lazyweb, I'm having severe issues with Apache's mod_rewrite on my VPS.

    &amp;lt;/Location&gt;
    #&amp;lt;/Directory&gt;
&amp;lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked fine when the root of the site had nothing but a simple index.html in it.  Now I've got Drupal7 installed, so it does all the fancy mod_rewrite stuff to get the clean urls, etc.  And now when I go to https://site/dav, Drupal is answering and saying "no such directory".  If I have /home/user/dav for the private WebDAV share, I'm using /home/user/public_html/ for the accessible web site (I do this to prevent any accidental exposure to those data files).  Incidentally I tried with both &amp;lt;Location&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;Directory&amp;gt; and it makes no difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The .htaccess in /home/user/public_html/ looks like this (just the important bits):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
  RewriteEngine on

  RewriteRule ^/dav(/.*)$ /dav/$1 [L,QSA]

  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]

&amp;lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried a number of variations (the above is my latest try).  Also tried things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/dav
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With and without the extra .* bits, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am literally tearing my hear out here.  Does anyone have any idea what I'm doing wrong?  I basically want it to go "hey, you want /dav?  ok, I won't rewrite anything and you can have it) and have /dav/[whatever] loaded requiring auth to access.  Something in the mod_rewrite is killing it, and I suspect it might have to do with Alias.  Maybe all this stuff needs to be in httpd.conf instead of .htaccess?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="apache"></category><category term="mod_rewrite"></category></entry><entry><title>rpm -V and prelinked binaries</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/rpm-v-and-prelinked-binaries" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-23T16:38:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-01-23T16:38:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2012-01-23:/blog/rpm-v-and-prelinked-binaries</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'v been asked this question a few times over the last year or so, so I thought I would explain some of why you might see some issues on a Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system (or any other Linux distribution that uses prelinked binaries) when trying to track …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'v been asked this question a few times over the last year or so, so I thought I would explain some of why you might see some issues on a Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system (or any other Linux distribution that uses prelinked binaries) when trying to track down strange MD5/SHA1 changes to binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, and for nearly a decade now, prelink has shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora.  What it does is modify the ELF code in binaries and libraries to speed up load times, so that fewer relocations need to be resolved when executing a program.  I can't explain all the details and technicalities of it because, quite frankly, they are above my limited brainpower to explain.  Suffice it to say, prelinking is a good thing.  Unless you are using AIDE or Tripwire.  These programs determine whether or not a file has changed based on their MD5SUM or SHA1SUM (or any other *SUM of the binary).  So when you install a program, AIDE sees a certain MD5SUM of the binary.  Later, when prelink runs, that binary might be modified to do the aforementioned relocations.  This will result in a different MD5SUM of the binary, and AIDE will most certainly tell you about the change.  What does not inform you of the change, however, is rpm -V (or rpm --verify).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verification command in RPM tells it to compare the MD5SUM of the files in certain package to what is on the filesystem.  It's a poor man's AIDE, and can also tell you what has changed on your system (from what RPM expects according to when it was installed).  In theory, you would expect rpm -V to report the same discrepancy that AIDE does.  The fact that it doesn't is what's led to a few questions regarding this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "problem" (if you can call it that) is that rpm knows about prelink, and knows how to deal with it.  As is succinctly explained in this &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/shrike-list/2003-April/msg00592.html"&gt;mailing list email&lt;/a&gt;, "rpm when --verify will prelink --verify, which is essentially --undo followed by prelinking again and comparing."  So the reason that rpm doesn't fail the verification is that it is basically turning off prelink for the file(s) to check, running the verification, then turning prelink back on.  This is why rpm won't report on a MD5SUM change, but AIDE will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those of us who use AIDE, we know that we need to do things like daily runs to make sure nothing has changed.  The problem is that if you do this and run a yum update, X number of hours later you'll get an email telling you that files have changed.  You might, at that point, update AIDE but there is a window of opportunity there where you may miss things.  We can minimize this by doing an AIDE check, then yum update, then force a prelink run, then update AIDE.  I've been doing this for a few years on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and it essentially gets rid of all false positives.  It's a little script called &lt;b&gt;do-update&lt;/b&gt; that I execute as root and it runs this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
aidecheck &amp;&amp; yum update -y &amp;&amp; /etc/cron.daily/prelink &amp;&amp; aideupdate
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't eliminate the window of opportunity completely, but it does lessen it considerably.  This uses my &lt;a href="https://github.com/vdanen/AIDE_gpg"&gt;AIDE_gpg&lt;/a&gt; scripts (aidecheck and aideupdate).  The rest is pretty self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this information will be useful to someone.  It took me a bit to dig up the mailing list message I link to above; I knew that prelink was had some special relationship with rpm, but I didn't know the particulars.  Now I do, and so do you.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="rpm"></category><category term="aide"></category></entry><entry><title>Some quick git tips</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/some-quick-git-tips" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-05T12:16:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-01-05T12:16:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2012-01-05:/blog/some-quick-git-tips</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I've been git-ifying some stuff around here, I've run into a few tips that might be useful for other git beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to setup some global options, some of which are nice for folks coming from Subversion.  Having a global ignore file is useful.  Mine has the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
*~
*.orig
*.rej
*.swp
.#*
*.o
.DS_Store
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then adjust some global git options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
$ git config --global alias.st status
$ git config --global alias.ci commit
$ git config --global alias.co checkout
$ git config --global alias.br branch
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email you@example.com
$ git config --global core.editor "vim"
$ git config --global color.branch auto
$ git config --global color.diff auto
$ git config --global color.interactive auto
$ git config --global color.status auto
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few allow for colorized output, which I like (makes things like git status easier to read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found out that I had screwed up the remote origin when setting up a new repository, and didn't want to re-do everything, so found this useful one-liner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ git remote rm origin
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git n00bs like me will appreciate the above.  =)  (Note to self, express git urls as ssh://git.remote.com/path/to/repo.git rather than ssh://git.remote.com:/path/to/repo.git!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the location of AIDE+gpg in the subversion repo was "tools/AIDE+gpg" and it had one sub-directory, "trunk".  I never did end up using tags or branches or anything there.  So the entire step from start to finish to do it was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git init AIDE
cd AIDE
echo "vdanen = Vincent Danen &lt;[my email]&gt;" &gt;authors.txt
git svn init -T trunk svn+ssh://[repo]/tools/AIDE+gpg --no-metadata 
git svn fetch -A authors.txt
git init --bare ../tmp
cd ../tmp
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/trunk
cd ../AIDE
git remote add bare ../tmp
git config remote.bare.push 'refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*'
git push bare
cd ../tmp
git branch -a
git branch -m trunk master
mv tmp AIDE+gpg.git
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presto.  Done.  Apparently I should now put this repo somewhere public (like github).  I will figure that part out after lunch.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="git"></category><category term="subversion"></category></entry><entry><title>Figuring this git thing out</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/figuring-this-git-thing-out" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-29T12:37:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-10-29T12:37:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2011-10-29:/blog/figuring-this-git-thing-out</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm a little old-school in that I like subversion.

I've used subversion for years, and have had it as a big part of my workflow for a really really long time.  Unfortunately, there's this git thing popping up all over the place and I'm starting to feel dated.  (It's bad enough that my daughter turned 10 this month, which makes me feel old, so I have to find other ways of not feeling out-dated!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that all of my version control repos are in subversion, and I hate losing history.  On some, I went through a painful CVS-&amp;gt;SVN migration when I first started using subversion, and I was pleasantly surprised that git makes it quite a bit easier.  I found &lt;a href="http://www.albin.net/git/convert-subversion-to-git"&gt;this blog posting&lt;/a&gt; that helped me (for the most part... if you don't use tags and branches, etc. you want to pay attention when doing some of the steps... took me a bit to figure that out).  Most notably, in steps four and five when changing the "trunk" to "master"; it assumes you have the standard trunk/, tags/, branches/ layout (which I do in some repos, and not in others).  If you use that convention, it works fine.  If not, you can run into problems like I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posting indicates to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git svn clone [SVN repo URL] --no-metadata -A authors-transform.txt \
   --stdlayout ~/temp
...
git init --bare ~/new-bare.git
cd ~/new-bare.git
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/trunk
cd ~/temp
git remote add bare ~/new-bare.git
git config remote.bare.push 'refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*'
git push bare
cd ~/new-bare.git
git branch -m trunk master
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this didn't work for me, as --stdlayout isn't so standard in my case (no tags/trunk/branches, so the top-level is the "trunk").  Instead I had to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git svn clone [svn repo] -A authors-transform.txt ~/tmp/git
cd ~/tmp/git
git init --bare ~/git/scripts.git
git remote add bare ~/git/scripts.git
git config remote.bare.push 'refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*'
git push bare
cd ~/git/scripts.git
git branch -m git-svn master
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the only branch is the "git-svn" branch, so we want to turn "git-svn" into "master" (rather than trying to hunt down some non-existant branch called "trunk").  There might have been a better way to do this, but I'm a n00b so forgive me.  All the explanation for the above is in that blog post I mentioned before (I'm mostly noting this as undoubtably I'll bump my head against this again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other useful links I found were &lt;a href="http://wiki.sourcemage.org/Git_Guide#How_do_I_get_my_copy_of_the_repository.3F"&gt;this git guide&lt;/a&gt; and a piece on &lt;a href="http://gofedora.com/how-to-install-configure-gitweb/"&gt;setting up gitweb on Fedora&lt;/a&gt; (works on RHEL also).  Gitweb was essential, as I'm used to using viewvc with my subversion repos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So will I use git for all my repos?  Probably not.  There are some old ones that don't need to be converted because it's all legacy code, and there are some others that I've built up with too much automation.  I would like to try to extract some pieces of existing subversion repos into git, however.  The AIDE+gpg scripts are one; they're in the Annvix tools repo, and I'd like to try to break it out into it's own git repo with history... not sure if this is possible but I'll poke around and see what I can come up with.  There are a few other Annvix tools that I'd do the same with (the rsec tool for one).  Since Annvix isn't in development anymore, I'd like to "untie" those tools from it and offer them as stand-alone things (probably on github or something).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently someone other than myself uses these scripts.  =)  AIDE+gpg is a set of scripts to make AIDE more like Tripwire in that the database is cryptographically signed (with gpg) so you can be alerted as to whether or not the AIDE database has been tampered with between runs. It also setups a cron job to check the database against the system daily to alert you of any changes. It is an add-on to AIDE that can be used on any Linux distribution (and probably distributions as well, although you may need to edit the scripts if the binary locations for gpg and aide differ from RHEL).&lt;/p&gt;

Since with other distros I've either used apt to do a dist-ugprade or the urpmi equivalent, this is somewhat my preferred upgrade path.  I've done it before and it worked amazingly well, so I did it again last night using these great instructions: &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Upgrading_Fedora_using_yum"&gt;Upgrading Fedora using yum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only gotchya is that due to the replacement of init by systemd, when it came time to reboot, halt/reboot/etc were unable to send the correct signals to something that would shut the machine down, so I had to do a hard reboot (which never plays nice with my RAID arrays, but upon reboot there was no RAID re-sync which is either cool or scary, I'm not yet sure which).  So that was a bit nerve-wracking.  Otherwise it was just a lengthy process with yum telling me I had 2850 packages to deal with (including installing and removing).  Instructions are good and clear.  Highly recommended if you're even moderately technically inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I get a good look at GNOME3, which doesn't work in my Fedora 15 vm's (well, it works, but it looks a lot like GNOME2 due to the "poor" video support in a vm).  I'm not sure what the big deal is... it's a little wonky and takes some getting used to.  I dislike that conky doesn't show up on the desktop, but so far that's my only real complaint.  I had icons for Komodo and CrashPlan on the desktop that are no longer visible, so had to use alacarte ("yum install alacarte; alacarte") to create new icons to go into the GNOME menu system.  Then I could add them to my favourites and was off and running.  It was about 1am when I finished so I haven't had too much time to play with it yet (although I also installed LXDE to give it a go as well, in case I didn't like GNOME3).  So far I don't mind it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else seemed to work out of the box other than my apache configuration file.  I have a few includes in /etc/httpd/conf/vhosts.d/*.conf and they weren't loading, so I think the handling of virtual hosts has changed because once I removed the default virtualhost definition ("&lt;VirtualHost _default_:80&gt;") that I had defined, the virtual hosts worked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I'm pleased.  I've played with F15 in my vm's since it came out (but mostly for testing security issues, etc.) so this is the first workstation with "stuff" that I've upgraded.  So one work vm and one laptop to go and then F14 is history.

&lt;p&gt;This is also one of the last TechMails that TechRepublic will be publishing that I've written.  There might be one or two more in the queue yet, I can't remember if everything I've submitted has been published or not.  It has been almost 12 years of writing monthly for TechRepublic -- initially as full length articles and the last few years as blog-style tips (which are both easier and harder to write; you get less words and more topics to cover in a month).  The last year or so I've also been writing Mac tips for TechRepublic, as one of the original contributors to the Mac track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve years is a long time, so it is with mixed feelings that I gave my resignation to TechRepublic last month.  I've worked with some really great editors: Jack, Sonja, Selena... you guys have been great to work with and I will definitely miss working with you.  I think, after a respite from technical writing, that I'll work on updating some of the documentation I have on the &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/"&gt;linsec.ca&lt;/a&gt; wiki, and hopefully finish off a few more that I've started but never completed.  At least writing for my own wiki there are no deadlines, no wracking the brain for various topics that appeal to a larger crowd (I can concentrate on the niche security/sysadmin stuff that I enjoy), so it should be a little more relaxed and hobby-ish, rather than feeling like "real work".&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="nagios"></category></entry><entry><title>Two-factor SSH authentication via Google secures Linux logins</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/two-factor-ssh-authentication-via-google-secures-linux-logins" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-25T08:35:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-06-25T08:35:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2011-06-25:/blog/two-factor-ssh-authentication-via-google-secures-linux-logins</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's TechMail was &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/two-factor-ssh-authentication-via-google-secures-linux-logins/2607"&gt;Two-factor SSH authentication via Google secures Linux logins&lt;/a&gt; which talks about using Google two-factor authentication with SSH (and PAM in general).

NX is wonderful; the only drawback is that the system you are connecting to needs to run Linux or Solaris.  If that is what you need to connect to, NX is highly recommended; there are clients for Windows and OS X in addition to Linux and Solaris, so it's great for connecting to remote Linux/Solaris servers or desktops.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="gtd"></category></entry><entry><title>Use APF to manage your firewall</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/use-apf-to-manage-your-firewall" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-14T23:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-03-14T23:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2011-03-14:/blog/use-apf-to-manage-your-firewall</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's techmail was &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/use-apf-to-manage-your-firewall/2302"&gt;Use APF to manage your firewall&lt;/a&gt; which takes a look at using the APF (Advanced Policy Firewall) set of scripts to configure an iptables-based firewall on Linux.

I guess when you're doing something you love, with amazing people you respect and enjoy working with, time has no real bearing on anything.  When I first started working for Linux-Mandrake (now Mandriva) back in 2000, I got Tux inked on the back of one leg.  Tux is fairly generic and represented the beginning of my journey with Linux (well, the beginning of my paid journey anyways!).  Tux is also much cooler to tattoo than the (sorry, but it's true) silly top hat and magic wand that was the logo for Linux-Mandrake back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadowman, on the other hand, is timeless and just plain cool.  If Red Hat turned into Yellow Hat or Purple Frog tomorrow, I think they'd be hard pressed to develop an icon like Shadowman.  And I've wanted Shadowman tattooed on the other leg for about a year now (my daughter is also very much enamoured with Shadowman and told me that he would make an extremely cool tattoo.. and I agree).  So yesterday the deed was done.  Probably the fastest tattoo I've ever gotten, and the greatest skin grinder to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagios is one of my favourite things to tinker with, and using NRPE is a bit nicer than using the check_by_ssh plugin that I used to use.  I don't really care if the load average or memory usage is sniffed, so using NRPE is nice and easy (and removes the hassles of key-based auth for SSH, seeing all those SSH connections show up in logwatch reports, etc.).

The machine in question is probably one of the most important in my home network: it handles DHCP, DNS, LDAP, and Kerberos for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHEL6 is amazing, but the migration was.. painful.  But I take full responsibility for that pain... if I had read the migration guide (or even pertinent parts of it), I could have saved myself two long nights.  Oh well, live and learn.  The other goal was to not copy any existing configs over, but to re-edit new configs (some of these configs hail from Annvix, some from Mandriva Corporate Server... it was due a cleaning and updating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS was easy enough, and DHCP was a piece of cake.  Kerberos was pretty good, but moving from Kerberos 1.6 to 1.8 had one interesting gotchya.  I had to work around Kerberized NFS previously due to a 1.8-based client talking to a 1.6-based server and it seems that a similar work-around was required for the server (note this is the KDC, it doesn't export anything for NFS).  I needed to add to /etc/krb5.conf in the [libdefaults] section, the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 # for NFS
 allow_weak_crypto = true
 default_tgs_enctypes = des-cbc-crc
 default_tkt_enctypes = des-cbc-crc
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that was done, Kerberos worked just as well as before and, more importantly, I wasn't seeing any problems in my krb5kdc.log when my Fedora 14 box was trying to get a ticket.  For Google's sake, the log entry looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Feb 23 17:33:20 kerberos.example.com krb5kdc[1679](info): TGS_REQ
(7 etypes {18 17 16 23 3 1 2}) 192.168.250.52: BAD_ENCRYPTION_TYPE:
authtime 0,  vdanen@EXAMPLE.COM for nfs/nfsserver.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM,
KDC has no support for encryption type
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LDAP was a severe PITA for me though.  There were a few challenges.  For one, it completely ignores /etc/openldap/slapd.conf now.  If I would have read &lt;a href="http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Migration_Planning_Guide/ch07s03.html"&gt;the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Migration Planning Guide&lt;/a&gt; I would have known this.  Sadly I chased my tail for two nights trying to figure out why TLS wasn't working at all (I could do an ldapsearch against the directory with -Z, but tossing in -ZZ always crapped out).  Eventually, I did get it working once I realized what was going on.  The big thing here is, if you have an existing slapd.conf you plan to migrate, you need to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# rm -rf /etc/openldap/slapd.d; mkdir /etc/openldap/slapd.d
# slaptest -f /etc/openldap/slapd.conf -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d
# chown -R ldap:ldap /etc/openldap/slapd.d/
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could remove the slapd.conf, but I since I find it nice and easy and comfortable, I've kept it (realizing that it's a template only, of sorts).  Also keep in mind that if your LDAP server is, for example, ldap.foo.com, you better darn well make sure the CN in the SSL certificate matches, or SSSD will be &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; unhappy with you.  I didn't realize this before (although before I don't believe I had enabled TLS (primarily because SSSD doesn't enforce TLS when doing NSS lookups, by the looks of things, but only when requesting authentication information (or sending it, as the case may be)).  It doesn't matter much to nss_ldap (where you can tell it to not use SSL/TLS), but it sure matters a lot to SSSD (which I didn't pay much attention to before because kerberos is handling the auth, not LDAP).  That drove me bonkers for a bit (SSSD, or whatever it's talking to, needs to be a little more helpful the error messages!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other gotchyas were that only gpg2 is available now, which played havoc with my AIDE+gpg scripts.  That was a simple fix, once I figured it out (the problem is that gpg-agent is pretty much mandatory, and pinentry doesn't seem to work too well if you don't have a GUI and are su -'d to another user).  Thankfully, I could work around this quite painlessly in my scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a good brain flex.  Frustrating as all get out, but now that it's working, I'm happy.  The next box is the internal intranet with kerberized apache, NFSv4 kerberized exports, nagios server, and internal subversion server.  I think I'll wait for the weekend on that one though.  I don't think it will be as painful as this box, but there will be a lot of SELinux policy tweaking on that one if I want to run it in enforcing mode.  I've also been mucking with this since Saturday, and feel like doing something a little less taxing for the rest of my evening.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="rhel"></category><category term="kerberos"></category><category term="ldap"></category></entry><entry><title>AIDE+gpg 1.0.2 released</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/aidegpg-1-0-2-released" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-23T17:57:00-07:00</published><updated>2011-02-23T17:57:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2011-02-23:/blog/aidegpg-1-0-2-released</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of my work migrating to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, I found that AIDE+gpg does not work with GnuPG2 (previously, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Annvix only used GnuPG version 1).

Highly amusing, especially for anyone that considers themself a hacker and wants to see what the defining characteristics of a hacker was 10 years ago.  Whether this was something serious or something tongue in cheek, it's an amusing read nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adequacy.org/stories/2001.12.2.42056.2147.html"&gt;Is Your Son a Computer Hacker?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just going to quote one part of it, which is the most amusing part, although the whole thing is worth reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"?&lt;/b&gt;

BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone.

Your son may try to install "lunix" on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional.

If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface.

Unfortunately, it's missing history because I had a dickens of a time trying to extract it from my existing svn repo (I got it so just the relevant commits where in there, but the entire history of the other repo came with it which does me no good).  You can check it out at &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/rq/wiki"&gt;https://fedorahosted.org/rq/wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problem I'm having now, and maybe someone on the lazyweb can help me with this, is that it is absolutely freaking slow.  Querying the database is fast enough when you're searching for something, but doing the imports and especially handling the updates is a process of hours.  For instance, to have it manage the updates for Fedora 14 (the SRPMs), I'm looking at 1311 package updates and 353 new packages being added.  It's been running since last night (I don't know the specific time it started, but it has to be well over 10hrs ago) and it's still in the "remove old package records" stage.  That seems highly excessive to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the database is big:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
rqs 0.6 ($Id: rqs 425 2011-01-21 23:37:19Z vdanen@ANNVIX.CA $)

Database statistics:

   Database  =&gt; User: rq, Host: localhost, Database: rqs
   Data size =&gt; 9.96 GB

   Tag records  : 5                Package records : 21629          
   File records : 9554598          Source records  : 76031          
   Ctags records: 56300434         Requires records: 100345
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what it is doing is first removing all of the old records (packages, files, ctags, requires, source files) before it can add in the new.  Of course, it does this one at a time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
if self.type == 'source':
  tables = ('packages', 'sources', 'files', 'ctags', 'buildreqs')
for rnum in to_remove:
  r_count = r_count + 1
  for table in tables:
    query  = "DELETE FROM %s WHERE p_record = %d" % (table, rnum)
    result = self.db.do_query(query)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the problem is I've reached my limit of understanding of efficient MySQL as I've never dealt with data sets this huge.  What would be the best way to handle this?  Would using temporary tables work best?  Would having each rpm repo on its own table work better?  That would logistically be more work as I'd have to create SQL tables on the fly (and while I would like this thing to be portable between db types at some point, it currently isn't -- but this would have an impact when I want to make it portable).  The problem then is if I want to query and look for 'sshd.c' for instance, I'd have to look across multiple tables (such as 'rqs_f14_source' and 'rqs_rhel6_source' instead of just 'source'), but my concern is that might increase the query time (querying right now is pretty fast, and I don't want to negatively impact querying times, but this import/update time now is ridiculous).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe that is the answer?  Multiple tables, grouped by repo (or tag, as rq calls them) as opposed to giant tables now?  I mean, looking at the number of rows in the ctags table (56,300,434), this is a pretty huge dataset.  Or can you remove from multiple tables at the same time (the p_record column is identical across tables... same name, same data).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realized I harped on CERT not too long ago about not doing things right.  =)  Granted, my key hasn't been compromised and I have no established schedule for rotating keys, but 6 years is a long time.  So I've generated a new key, and revoked the old key.  Direct link to the new key/revocation certificate: &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/vdanen.asc"&gt;http://linsec.ca/vdanen.asc"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been signed with my old key and a few others.  If anyone out there has signed my old key (0xFEE30AD4), I would surely appreciate you signing the new key as well.  I think a trail of trust has been established with the new key.  The particulars:&lt;/p&gt;

It is ridiculous that an organization supposedly as secure as &lt;a href="http://www.cert.org/"&gt;CERT&lt;/a&gt; can have such poor distribution mechanisms for alerting users of their new GPG keys.  It is really important that, when you update GPG keys and distribute the public key that you can &lt;i&gt;easily&lt;/i&gt; establish trust of the new key.  There are a few ways this can be done: sign the new key with the old (known and/or trusted) key, sign any distribution mails with the old key (to ensure authenticity), include a revocation in the new key to import, and have a secure place where that information can be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CERT changes keys often -- way more often than their once-a-year policy on their web site indicates; well, this year they have anyways.  Previous years were one key a year.  However, they don't follow any of these "best practices".  And they know it, because I've told them in the past.  And yet, even now, they still can't get it right.  What's more amusing is that on their &lt;a href="https://www.cert.org/contact_cert/encryptmail.html"&gt;Sending Sensitive Information to CERT&lt;/a&gt; page, which is SSL encrypted, shows &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; different fingerprints.  For posterity, I took the following screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/cert-gpg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://linsec.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/cert-gpg-300x165.jpg" alt="CERT&amp;#039;s web page for posterity" title="CERT web page" width="300" height="165" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-835" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wrong fingerprint listed in section #2 belongs to the old key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key released today is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how things are getting sloppy, we need to go back a bit further to see what had been done in the past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
pub   2048R/B7FBBBC1 2010-01-20 [revoked: 2010-03-03]

sig          AF30D800 2010-01-20  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the difference here?  This third-latest key was signed by another CERT-owned key (AF30D800), which was the previous-to-that key used.  Trust is then established to the new key, &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; the old (known) key.  The most current and previous keys were not signed by their predecessors, which makes them harder to trust.  So in the last three keys, two are self-signed, one is properly signed to establish trust (by the previous key).  What's even more sad is that key AF30D800 was nicely signed: not only by the previous key, but also by a "master key" which also establishes more authenticity of the key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this one is a good key, a trustable key.  The last two keys are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple that with the half-updated web page and you're left scratching your head -- or, at least, I was.  Not so much this time because, sadly, I'm no longer surprised.  But last time I actually phoned CERT to verify the new key's fingerprint because I had nothing to trust it with.  In fact, when the mail came out to notify of the new key, it was signed with the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; key, not the old key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm... excuse me, but I can spoof sending a mail from cert@cert.org and generate my own key with the uid cert@cert.org and bloody well sign it with the spoofed key I just generated!  The only thing I couldn't do is update their web page but, honestly, I wonder how many people check.  And of those that do, have they done it in the past and noticed prior inconsistencies and just chalked it up to... incompetence?  Negligence?  Key distribution malpractice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there is nothing for me to trust that this new key is legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's sad that an organization built around &lt;i&gt;security&lt;/i&gt; has no clue about this.  What's worse, is they've been told (twice!) about a better way to distribute new keys.  I know.  I told them.  Both times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to recap, these are things you &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; do when distributing a new GPG key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sign the email sending out the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; key with the &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt; key.  Seriously, it establishes trust and proves you are who you say you are
&lt;li&gt; Fully and completely update your web site.  It's nice you have one, and it's nice that it's semi-updated, and even better that you can get to it via SSL.  But if it lists the new key in section 1 and section 2 is about verifying the fingerprint but lists the &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt; key's fingerprint, how do you trust any of it?
&lt;li&gt; Sign the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; key with the &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt; key.  It proves that the person/organization who has the old key trusts the new one enough to sign it.  Like giving it a seal of approval or just saying "hey, this is legit"
&lt;li&gt; For Pete's sake, revoke the old key!  It doesn't have to necessarily be in the same message, but it should be revoked.  Heck, send out a mail signed with the old key, containing the new key, and then send out another message signed with the new key, revoking the old key.  Or have one email message sending two different GPG-signed sections so one email does it all.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is difficult to do, and it makes trusting these new keys so much easier.  I've not paid attention to see if other people/organizations fail so badly here, but I don't get what makes this so hard to do.  It's not rocket science, just common sense.  I can see Joe Average maybe not thinking about it, but for an organization like CERT?  Come on.  How are we supposed to trust what you send out when you can't even get Simple Key Management 101 right?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="gpg"></category></entry><entry><title>A month of Linux techmails</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/a-month-of-linux-techmails" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-09-07T18:47:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-09-07T18:47:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2010-09-07:/blog/a-month-of-linux-techmails</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been so busy in the last little while I've not had a chance to post the recent techmails that have gone up, so here goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1702"&gt;Cloud-based RSS reading with Google Reader and Liferea&lt;/a&gt; looks at using Liferea as a client for Google Reader.  The nice thing about using Google Reader is you can use the web UI, or standalone clients (like Liferea) on whichever operating system you happen to be using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1724"&gt;Regular expressions for everyone: The basics&lt;/a&gt; takes a look at some of the basics of using regular expressions.  I have a love/hate relationship with regexps, but they are &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; useful, so here's a quick primer on some basics you can use with tools like grep or when writing configuration directives (i.e. in Apache).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1737"&gt;Easy Gmail reading with mutt&lt;/a&gt; looks at using mutt to read your Google Mail (Gmail) and how it can be done effectively using nothing more than mutt itself.  It even looks at mimicking some of the keybindings used in the web UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1753"&gt;Get website metrics with AWStats&lt;/a&gt; looks at using the AWStats program to get a detailed view of who, how, and when people are visiting your web site, with a quick primer on how to get it setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1784"&gt;Get text-mode calendar and TODO lists with Calcurse&lt;/a&gt; is an introduction to a neat little tool called Calcurse, a text-mode calendar with TODO list capabilities.  For the text UI purist, Calcurse is really neat.  It's not perfect, but it's quite good and (to me) is certainly better than using a flat text file.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>New Fedora git repositories</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/new-fedora-git-repositories" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-03T10:10:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-08-03T10:10:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2010-08-03:/blog/new-fedora-git-repositories</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little bit frustrated with Fedora's new git repositories this morning (for packages).

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there still seems to be some issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Cloning into bare repository /cvs-scratch/fedora/opensc/fedpkg.git...
open log failed: Permission denied
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
Could not clone: Command '['git', 'clone', '--bare', 'ssh://me@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/opensc', '/cvs-scratch/fedora/opensc/fedpkg.git']' returned non-zero exit status 128
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what this means.  But the old CVS repository doesn't seem to be usable either, which kinda stinks.  I'm sure it's just a minor buglet or two and will get worked out eventually.  Very very happy that we're no longer using CVS for this... I'd prefer SVN myself, but git is ok too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="git"></category></entry><entry><title>Clear some desk space with cross-platform keyboard and mouse sharing app</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/clear-some-desk-space-with-cross-platform-keyboard-and-mouse-sharing-app" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-27T14:16:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-07-27T14:16:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2010-07-27:/blog/clear-some-desk-space-with-cross-platform-keyboard-and-mouse-sharing-app</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1696"&gt;Clear some desk space with cross-platform keyboard and mouse sharing app&lt;/a&gt;.

I've been using Komodo for years, and even though it is pay-to-play, it's still my favourite IDE.  In particular, I really like the fact that it has support for so many languages...

Of course, now that I'm doing more in python than PHP, I would have been using Komodo more anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tip looks at things like customizing the toolbox to get more snippets and commands in there (i.e. running pylint on the currently open file), looks at debugging support, changing the keybindings (need my vim keybindings!), and some of the add-ons you can install (since Komodo is based on Mozilla code, it is capable of using addons, just like Firefox or Thunderbird).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="komodo"></category></entry><entry><title>Increase download speed with Aria2 utility</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/increase-download-speed-with-aria2-utility" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-30T09:18:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-06-30T09:18:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2010-06-30:/blog/increase-download-speed-with-aria2-utility</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's techmail was &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1622"&gt;Increase download speed with Aria2 utility&lt;/a&gt; which looks at an incredibly useful and cool file download client.

It's got a Core i7 quad CPU (Q9300), 8GB RAM, and dual boots Windows 7 and Fedora 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear lazyweb, how can I make this system as quite on Fedora as it is on Windows?  It's absolutely silent when Win7 is running, but when Fedora is running the fans are quite noisy.  Most of the time the system has a load average of 0.00 so it isn't CPU spiking causing the fans to go full-bore.  For temperatures I have Core0 at about 51C and Core1 at 44C and the other two cores at 48C, but the fans are running at 1583 and 1160 rpm.  I can't get the sensors to pick up temps or fan speeds on Win7 for some reason so don't have a basis for comparison (tried a few of those "gadgets" and none show me temperatures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has to be a way to lower the fan speed on Fedora but I can't find it.  I tried fancontrol from lm_sensors but it complains about not being able to manually set the fans and there's nothing I can see in the BIOS that's even remotely relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I doomed to a noisy Fedora box?  Or is there a way I can make this thing quieter short of buying new fans?  (The latter is an option I suppose, but if Win7 can run perfectly silent, then I'm of the frame of mind that Fedora should too).  Running an up to date F13 (wheeee!!).

I use Dropbox here for keeping certain files in sync between systems, but I also am connected to a secondary Dropbox to act as a remote backup for a long-standing client of mine.  It works great; they have two systems that share data (encrypted disk images), and I've also had to run a second copy of Dropbox on my system here to keep a copy of that data, but I was then rsyncing it to my remote backup server as well.  With this, I can skip my system at home as being the "middle man" and get that remote backup server (headless CentOS 5) linked to the Dropbox instead.  Saves bandwidth and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a very small set of packages so I don't feel too awful about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, one of my favourite features in Annvix was being able to run the entire system out of runit (Annvix used runit in place of SysVinit).  This gave us nicely supervised services using runit (much like DJB's daemontools).  Feeling crappy with the first day of a head cold, I spent some time today over lunch to get runit working with RHEL5.  I had to re-tool the package since I don't want it to replace SysVinit, but run under init and just supervise services (like sshd, exim, etc. -- call me weird, but runit/daemontools makes a fantastic watchdog and with sshd running from tcpsvd, I get some nice ACLs to use as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, runit now installs and works properly.  Sorry to anyone who wanted to use it (I've been meaning to do this for the last year, ever since I switched all of my servers over to CentOS).  The runit package also comes with a bunch of run scripts; I've not tested them all yet so if you do end up using it and have issues, let me know.  I did have to fix a few minor things in a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I've chkconfig'd off a few services and have them running supervised now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of that, I know I can setup VNC or NX or whatever to get onto her computer.  That's fine, but I'd like something like iChat that does screen &lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; so I can see what silly thing she's doing and prevent me from getting in the car in the first place (not that I dislike visiting my mother, understand, but this is a fairly routine occurrence that would best be done by remote since I'm not so good at hiding the irritation in my face).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not aware of anything that can do this... is there something out there that will do the trick?  Right now she's running Mandriva 2009.0, but I plan to upgrade that to Fedora 12 one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Learn and use regular expressions with Kodos</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/learn-and-use-regular-expressions-with-kodos" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-13T08:59:00-07:00</published><updated>2010-02-13T08:59:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2010-02-13:/blog/learn-and-use-regular-expressions-with-kodos</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's Linux techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1251"&gt;Learn and use regular expressions with Kodos&lt;/a&gt; which is a slick little app written in python that lets you learn regular expressions and build them in a nice GUI interface.

Unfortunately, it converted one Maildir to another.  =(  One crucial piece is missing, so here is the one-liner in all its glory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ mutt -f Archive/ -e 'set mbox_type=mbox; set confirmcreate=no; \
set delete=no; push "T.*&amp;lt;enter&gt;;sarchive&amp;lt;enter&gt;&amp;lt;quit&gt;"'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above converts the Maildir &lt;i&gt;Archive/&lt;/i&gt; to the mbox named &lt;i&gt;archive&lt;/i&gt;.  It also makes the assumption that mbox_type is set to Maildir (which is how I have it configured; if it wasn't for that, the default is mbox and that's what it would have created, but I changed the default to Maildir, hence the need to be specific).

I'm quite certain all my friends would think it silly.  Heck, I'd have more luck getting people to my place if I threw a Partylite candle party!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the whole thing is highly amusing.  First, you have to look at the videos.  These are priceless.  I must know how much you get paid to look so dang happy showing people the marvels of an innovative "search" feature.  Seriously, you need to check these out.  I can't say they're good for a laugh... they're not.  But they're certainly bewildering and bewitching... like... well, nothing comes to mind.  But don't watch the introductory video (well, if you must, go for it)... it's long and I was almost crying by the end of it.  Yeah, it's that bad.  Here it is: &lt;a href="http://www.houseparty.com/offers/windows7usa/hosthelpvideos"&gt;Windows 7 house party host help videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I post this isn't to necessarily mock Microsoft.  They're doing a fine job of that themselves.  But I wanted to point out an absolutely brilliant piece of journalism that was written because of these videos and is extremely amusing.  (Thanks Maurice for posting the link on the ELUG list!).  &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/28/charlie-brooker-microsoft-mac-windows"&gt;Microsoft's grinning robots or the Brotherhood of the Mac. Which is worse?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll forgive you if you don't watch the videos.  Only a morbid fascination had me watch three of them (and by then it was just so patently ridiculous I couldn't justify spending another moment watching more), but this article is pure genius.  Some of the comments are mighty amusing as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Get network versatility with SSH tunneling and netcat</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/get-network-versatility-with-ssh-tunneling-and-netcat" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-09-29T22:14:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-09-29T22:14:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-09-29:/blog/get-network-versatility-with-ssh-tunneling-and-netcat</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=950"&gt;Get network versatility with SSH tunneling and netcat&lt;/a&gt; which talks about using netcat as a proxy tool to bounce transparently through a bastion host to a secure end point.

He wrote a blog post about &lt;a href="http://dodonov.net/blog/2009/09/02/msec-future-and-plans/"&gt;msec's future and plans&lt;/a&gt; detailing the things he wants to do with msec in the future.  So he dropped me a line to see how I'd feel about making msec and rsec play nice together so there wouldn't necessarily be a need for both (since there is obviously some duplication of functionality, one being a fork of the other after all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think this might be a good move.  rsec is essentially a complete tool, but if we can swap in msec's plugin functionality for the reports and make it so that is can be a standalone component separate from msec (be it that msec drops the reporting capabilities and adopts a refreshed rsec as a dependency, or whether msec permits building just the reporting capabilities separate from the msec stuff), then I'm definitely game.  What might be interesting, however, is to see how msec and rsec can be merged with &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/sectool/"&gt;sectool&lt;/a&gt; in some way.  To be honest, I'd never heard of sectool until Eugeni mentioned it... it's a Fedora project so it might have a lot of Red Hat/Fedora-specific stuff in there, but if it is or could be more generalized to do what msec does as well as what rsec does, then maybe there's a place for one tool to take the place of three tools and have a broader usage base and become a better tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity here to build a better tool out of two, or maybe even three, tools is quite interesting and one of the things I love about open source.  Merging msec and rsec should be quite easy I think.  Merging with sectool might be more difficult, but I see a lot of crossover in what msec and sectool both do already -- there really is no reason to have a Mandriva-specific tool and a Fedora-specific tool that do the same thing.  I suspect sectool might be good at creating decent reports which may even obsolete the need for rsec.  Taking a closer look at sectool will help me determine if that is the case (and then it remains to be seen if there is a sectool build for EPEL or if it can be done since I'm currently using rsec on some Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and CentOS 5 systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, I smell some possibilities here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Mirroring Web sites with wget</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mirroring-web-sites-with-wget" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-09-01T18:08:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-09-01T18:08:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-09-01:/blog/mirroring-web-sites-with-wget</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=883"&gt;Mirroring Web sites with wget&lt;/a&gt; which discusses using wget to mirror... websites!

&lt;p&gt;Googling it showed &lt;a href="http://www.svnforum.org/2017/viewtopic.php?t=8009&amp;sid=7bd9dc113ea5ff181ebbeaa959ee5234" rel="nofollow"&gt;one other guy&lt;/a&gt; who had it and never had an answer to his question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistence is the codeword of the day, so I finally figured it out.  Seems that OS X does things a little wonky with kerberos.  A tutorial I read about using mod_auth_kerb indicated you had to use the hostname of the server, regardless of any virtualhost names (so my server name is hades, the virtualhost alias is svn; the made-up domain is, originally, example.com).  Safari kept popping up the authentication dialog whenever I tried accessing the repository, which is not at all what I wanted.  I had to ktadd a new principle (HTTP/svn.example.com) with the virtualhost alias (which the tutorial said &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do).  Then Safari started working, but svn bombed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in Fedora 11, none of this was a problem.  But here's the weird part: klist on F11 showed HTTP/hades.example.com (from subversion or firefox), whereas on OS X subversion crapped out and crashed and Safari showed HTTP/svn.example.com.  So I decided to see what firefox on OS X would do and it (properly) used HTTP/hades.example.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the weirdest part is that svn is working again!  Why?  For some reason (and I'm not quite sure whether I should be blaming OS X here or neon or a combination of the two), svn is not initiating obtaining a ticket for HTTP/hades.example.com.  I'm not sure why, because on F11 it did.  If I kdestroy and kinit (so I only have krbtgt's ticket), svn craps out.  However, once I used Firefox to obtain the ticket, svn could re-use it and all worked well.  If I remove the HTTP/svn.example.com principle on the server, svn still doesn't work and neither does Safari (I get the login dialog).  Obviously that's not my problem.  I'm wondering if these Collab binaries built for OS X are messed up somehow; I'll have to try from fink or build from source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was like pulling teeth tonight.  Definitely an interesting puzzle that I probably could have done without.  It'll be interesting to see if other svn builds on OS X do the same thing (of course, I could dispense with making svn use GSSAPI for this, but half the fun is seeing how many passwords I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; need).  At this point I have no real idea why svn even worked at all in the first place -- unless during the course of testing with Firefox I already had HTTP/hades.example.com's ticket.  Hmmm....&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="kerberos"></category></entry><entry><title>Kerberos fun</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/kerberos-fun" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-16T10:25:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-07-16T10:25:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-07-16:/blog/kerberos-fun</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This actually isn't a sarcastic title, for once.

I was put into a position to do some kerberos debugging for work, so had to re-setup a kerberos realm at home to do the testing.  Of course, at the time I also updated my &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/Using_Kerberos_5_for_Single_Sign-On_Authentication"&gt;Using Kerberos 5 for Single Sign-On Authentication&lt;/a&gt; which was a little out of date.  So I updated that to be relevant to RHEL rather than Annvix, and fixed a few bits that were out-dated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I did more poking around and figured out a few bits that were preventing me from actually using it years ago when I first setup a kerberos realm (didn't seem overly useful to me at the time).  I've got my OS X workstation kerberized which was... not as straight-forward as I would hope, but not awful (LDAP authentication from OpenLDAP is another matter entirely... still haven't nailed that yet).  So right now on my network I have my workstation, my server, and two vm's kerberized -- just for SSH now (which doesn't seem really amazing since I've been using SSH keys for years so no passwords, but this seems even more hands-off and will help with future vm deployments since it should all be out-of-the-box).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I've been poking around and found that you can hook Mediawiki up to LDAP/Kerberos for auth.  I never knew that.  All of a sudden this seems a lot cooler.  Oh, and subversion apparently works with kerberos (using mod_auth_kerb).  Then, the icing on the cake was to see a python-kerberos module which makes this &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too interesting to ignore since I've been doing some python coding recently and have really enjoyed it, and some future projects/ideas could really benefit from some kerberos love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, as I figure new bits out, I'll be updating my linsec.ca wiki article -- the info is out there but some of it isn't the easiest to grok.  Hopefully I can make it a bit more accessible/readable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="kerberos"></category></entry><entry><title>Towards responsible disclosure</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/towards-responsible-disclosure" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-09T18:11:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-07-09T18:11:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-07-09:/blog/towards-responsible-disclosure</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week was interesting, dealing with the supposed "OpenSSH 0day" vulnerability stuff... rumours, innuendo, strange logs and packet capture files... it made for a long week trying to keep an eye on this and sort fact from fiction.

Instead of focusing on the issue itself like other blogs and news sites are doing, I thought it might be interesting to look at some general resources to aid in the responsible disclosure of issues.  I won’t focus on whether or not this issue is fact, or fiction, or who caused it, who furthered it, who took advantage of it, or why it was done in the first place.  I'm more thinking of the fallout and the general panic it caused in a lot of people.  The problem with pegging OpenSSH as vulnerable is that it is a service used on most servers, and is a service that, more importantly, is perhaps one of the most &lt;em&gt;vital&lt;/em&gt; on servers.  As seen with one hosting company that preemptively shut SSH accessibility off entirely, a lot of people just couldn't get things done.  Other services, like DNS, are equally vital, so the fallout can be quite brutal -- even when something is not substantiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that makes this a problem today is the how fast information spreads, and how quickly something posted online is taken as gospel.  For instance, starting a rumour like this is extremely simple and can be done by one person with a bunch of email addresses and a little bit of knowledge.  This kind of social engineering can be used for a lot of things beyond just phishing (money, passwords, whatever).  It can be used to sow confusion, which could be used as a smoke-screen to cover other nefarious deeds and redirect attention from the truly nasty things going on, and it can also be used to perpetrate such fear that people are essentially causing a Denial of Service against themselves and/or their customers simply because of rumours spreading like wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, half the battle here is dealing with this stuff smarter and better, and more responsibly.  Outfits that claim inside information but aren't willing to share it are not being responsible.  I'm not saying to necessarily share it with the public at large (right away, at least), as that may not serve the public's best interest.  But to provide crucial information to affected vendors (who can then take that and develop fixes to help a much larger audience) or upstream is absolutely the responsible thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I'd like to share a few links that can help people disclose issues they are aware of, or suspect, in a more responsible fashion.  Holding info tight to your chest like a bag of sour gummies doesn't help anyone but you, and even then, it can harm more than help.  Individuals or companies that claim to have inside info and are working on a fix may not be the appropriate people to work on a fix in the first place.  After all, who knows code better than the folks who wrote it?  It makes more sense to take the issue and all the information you have and open up communication with the vendor/upstream in order to facilitate an appropriate fix that helps &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, not just yourself.  Quite often the fix you suggest is quite a ways from that which the vendor or upstream would use, and may cause more problems than it corrects.  So getting appropriate people involved just makes sense, and peer review is an asset that the open source community understands -- and views as necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are a few links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists"&gt;OSS Security wiki: Security-related mailing lists&lt;/a&gt; contains a list of mailing lists you can use to get in touch with people who care and sincerely want to help.  Many vendors are represented on both public and private lists, suitable for discussing issues that are currently public (oss-security) or those that are currently private (vendor-sec)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/whattodo"&gt;What to do if I encounter a security issue&lt;/a&gt; is a page that documents how to deal with a security or suspected security issue and how to make sure it gets to the right people
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/backporting/"&gt;Backporting of Security Fixes&lt;/a&gt;  talks about why many vendors, including Red Hat, backport fixes to packages rather than just updating to new ones (I'm including this because there was a lot of misinformation about OpenSSH versions being out-of-date and presumably insecure because they aren't the latest-and-greatest)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/security/team/contact/"&gt;Red Hat Security Contacts and Procedures&lt;/a&gt; is the contact page for the Red Hat Security Response Team; please use it if you think you have something as we absolutely want and love to help with this sort of stuff and if you don't know who to contact, chances are we can take care of that on your behalf
&lt;/li&gt;

Responsible disclosure is really important, and everyone needs to do their part when it comes to this stuff.  Irresponsible disclosure, or no disclosure, hurts more people than it helps and has been the source of many a headache for a whole lot of people over the years.</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="openssh"></category></entry><entry><title>Hacking Vim covers the basics and reveals tips for power users</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/hacking-vim-covers-the-basics-and-reveals-tips-for-power-users" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-08T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-07-08T13:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-07-08:/blog/hacking-vim-covers-the-basics-and-reveals-tips-for-power-users</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=727"&gt;Hacking Vim covers the basics and reveals tips for power users&lt;/a&gt;, which is a book review of "Hacking Vim" by Packt Publishing.

The scenario is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one system that can access a private school network and do not want to setup the same vpn connection on other systems.  So this little box has a connection to the school vpn, and I have the following in ~/.ssh/config in order to access it, which forwards locally to the proxy server at the school so I can get onto their internal site(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Host school
  Hostname fw.school.com
  User vdanen
  LocalForward 33306 dev.school.com:3306
  LocalForward 2228 dev.school.com:3128
  compression yes 
  KeepAlive yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this works fine.  This also means I have to ssh into the box (which is good from an authentication standpoint) in order to access any services.  Consider this a poor-man's VPN.  Incidentally it also lets me use some GUI mysql tools to access the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to use an automatic proxy.pac file on my local web server, so I have http://server/proxy.pac that contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
{
    if (shExpMatch(url, "http://*.school.com*"))
    {
        return "PROXY localhost:2228; DIRECT";
    }
    if (shExpMatch(url, "https://*.school.com*"))
    {
        return "PROXY localhost:2228; DIRECT";
    }

    return "DIRECT";
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is that I can get to http://&lt;em&gt;.school.com sites, but https://&lt;/em&gt;.school.com sites aren't hitting the proxy at all.  I use OpenDNS at home, so they keep pointing to OpenDNS.  I can work around this in Firefox by setting the network.proxy.{http,ssl} and network.proxy.{http,ssl}_port settings in about:config, but I want this to be system-wide (thus the proxy.pac file).  On OS X, if I use the System Preferences to have the auto-proxy setup and point it to the proxy.pac file, I can get the http:// sites from the school, but not the https:// ones (which is problematic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been looking and reading all over the place and there doesn't seem to be anyone with this problem that I've found so far, which either means I'm doing something wrong or no one is trying to get to https sites via a proxy setup like this.  I'm leaning towards wrong as if I do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ http_proxy="http://localhost:2228" elinks https://secure.school.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get an error about the host being down.  But if I ssh into the host and do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ http_proxy="http://dev.school.com:3128" elinks https://secure.school.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works.  I don't get it because localhost:2228 is most definitely forwarding to dev.school.com:3128.  Does anyone have any ideas on what might be wrong here?  Getting it to work in Firefox is great, but it also needs to work with Safari as well (if it didn't, I'd be satisfied with the manual settings in Firefox).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Install OpenVZ on CentOS to create a virtual container</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/install-openvz-on-centos-to-create-a-virtual-container" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-04-21T10:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-04-21T10:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-04-21:/blog/install-openvz-on-centos-to-create-a-virtual-container</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=558"&gt;Install OpenVZ on CentOS to create a virtual container&lt;/a&gt; which discusses using the &lt;a href="http://www.openvz.org/"&gt;OpenVZ&lt;/a&gt; virtualization software.

I have to admit, I've become extremely fond of OpenVZ.  I stumbled upon it as the open source version of Virtuozzo which is used by a lot of VPS providers and I completely understand why.  All I really need or want (for the most part) is a glorified chroot or BSD jail and OpenVZ fills this really nicely, without the overhead of full hardware virtualization.  It's easy to use, easy to maintain and run, and for Linux-on-Linux virtualization I think it blows away everything else I've tried for remote servers (vmware server?  no thanks!).  The fact that it's very light-weight and very configurable have given this thing a permanent place on my internal server.  I just wish it more closely followed the upstream kernel releases, but other than that, I'm loving it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="centos"></category><category term="containers"></category></entry><entry><title>Dodge the challenges of a dual-head display setup with Fedora 10</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/dodge-the-challenges-of-a-dual-head-display-setup-with-fedora-10" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-04-14T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-04-14T13:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-04-14:/blog/dodge-the-challenges-of-a-dual-head-display-setup-with-fedora-10</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=548"&gt;Dodge the challenges of a dual-head display setup with Fedora 10&lt;/a&gt; which discusses setting up a dual-head display on my Lenovo T61 and how insanely easy it ended up being... once I knew what I was doing.

&lt;p&gt;Annvix is not coming back as an operating system like it used to be, but rather a repository of packages for RHEL/CentOS (currently just version 5).  There is very little there right now: a new version of openssh and a new version of logwatch.  It will increase as time permits.  I do plan on "porting" some of the stuff I had done for Annvix to RHEL5; things like rsec, AIDE+GPG, runit, scripts to use with runit, etc.  Essentially those things that were fun to deal with on Annvix, but without the pain of managing a whole OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel like giving it a go, just execute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# rpm -ivh http://repo.annvix.org/media/EL5/x86_64/annvix-release-1.0-2.el5.avx.x86_64.rpm
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on your RHEL5 or CentOS5 install (change x86_64 to i386 if you're using an x86 system).  If you have the priority plugin setup on CentOS, make sure you edit /etc/yum.repos.d/annvix.repo and add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
priority = 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or something suitable.  The &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/"&gt;annvix.org&lt;/a&gt; web site will be updated at some point to reflect that Annvix is a repository add-on to RHEL5 now instead of a stand-alone OS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting started with the yum package manager</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/getting-started-with-the-yum-package-manager" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-03-13T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-03-13T09:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-03-13:/blog/getting-started-with-the-yum-package-manager</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=449"&gt;Getting started with the yum package manager&lt;/a&gt; which goes into some of the basics of using yum.

I usually write code in PHP or shellscript, with the odd thing in Perl every once in a while (but I'm not a real big fan of perl and I don't have the desire to dig into it more).  A lot of my more sophisticated projects that can't be done in shellscript are usually done with CLI PHP.  But Python is something I've wanted to learn, so I've started digging into it and my first dive is rewriting a CLI PHP program "suite" that creates and scours a database for RPM information (dependencies, requires, files, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been at it for about 2 weeks now with what little time I have and the original suite consists of two programs: rqp and rqs.  These two programs were a result of a rewrite of the "srpm" PHP program that Stew Benedict wrote years ago for the Mandriva secteam (and which has proven invaluable of the years).  It handled only src.rpm files, so I rewrote and extended it to handle binary and source rpm files (rqp and rqs respectively).  It was a quick-n-dirty extension that was used for a few years on the Mandriva secteam and worked really well (and probably is still working well for them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gotten rqp converted to Python and it's working quite well.  Because rqp and rqs share a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of functions, I wanted to write rqp.py and rqs.py and have a shared module between them (rq.py) and this is where I'm having issues.  Does anyone know how to have a module get access to an object from the calling program?  For instance, rqp uses the optparse module to nicely handle the commandline arguments, but a lot of the modules use options.foo to look up arguments that were passed.  The functions in rq.py (the module) can't seem to get the value of options, and while I could put the optparse stuff in the module, it would leave the actual rqp and rqs programs really really small (and I'd have to either put in two functions because the two programs use different syntax).  So I've got in rqp.py:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
import rq
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which works ok, but if rq.db_connect() requires options.database (for instance), it can't get it.  So in rq.py, I tried doing a circular import or whatever it's called by doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
import options from rqp
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this doesn't want to work either.  The output looks quite sad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% ./rqp.py -d

But, since I'm not longer using Mandriva and need to get used to Red Hat products (Fedora, RHEL, etc.), CentOS makes sense for upgrading my internal server to.  It was also a long week, so I goofed a bit on it (I did backups of mysql and ldap, but didn't do dumps of the data which I only realized after the fact... could have been very very bad).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the system is a quad core 2 duo system with 8GB RAM.  CentOS refused to boot at first until I specified "linux acpi=off".  Downside there is it only got me the use of one core rather than the four.  That was later fixed using "pci=nommconf", which allowed the kernel to boot and got me all four cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The install went well.  Seems like a lot less to select, and therefore tweak, than the Mandriva installers I'm used to.  But it wasn't bad.  Nice thing was it picked up and auto-assembled all my mdadm RAID1 arrays, so I could format those that needed it and left the others alone.  Unfortunately, it didn't fully associate them... after the install when I booted they were in a degraded state so I had to hot-add the second partition for each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real kicker is the placement of files.  There are a few places where Mandriva and CentOS differ, like where the named chroot is, so that took some monkeying around with.  I also had SELinux in enforcing mode at first, but it didn't really like the fact that I was using /srv/www/[domain] instead of /var/www/html for serving up web content, and it didn't like the vhost.d/*.conf bit in httpd.conf so Apache was pretty broken until I disabled SELinux.  I've never actually used SELinux before, so now I have to learn how to set policies and targets and all that other goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps was setting up the rpmforge yum repository.  Too much of CentOS is just too dated for me.  I need subversion 1.5 (comes with 1.4) and nagios 3.x (comes with 2.x).  I was not going to change my nagios configs to suit the older version.  rpmforge makes all of that pretty easy though.  I did have to copy /var/lib/mysql over and other than changing the ownership of the files to match the new uid/gid for the mysql user, it all worked out great.  I have not yet done the openldap setup though, so I'm not sure if I'll be as lucky with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still quite a few configuration tweaks to make.  It also didn't help that I had to reset my network from a 10.10 network to a 192.168 network.  I'm sure that may still bite me a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it all seems to have worked out ok.  I was asked why I didn't just use Fedora for this and while Fedora may be stable enough, I don't want to have to upgrade every year.  That makes CentOS compelling.  All this machine does is run nagios to monitor other sites, provide DHCP and DNS services, LDAP for authentication for my virtual machines, web/mysql serving, and does automatic backups of other systems in the LAN.  The reason I upgraded from Corporate Server 4.0 to 2009.0 in the first place was the idea that CS5 was going to be based on 2009.0 (so I was getting a jump on things).  Time will tell how it goes, but I think it should be ok.  Last month I deployed 4 CentOS boxes for a client, with one more left to do, so I'm starting to get a little used to it and yum.  =)  The SELinux thing may be a bit more work to get used to (I've used RSBAC and AppArmor, but never really played with SELinux).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then tomorrow I'm upgrading a laptop to Fedora 11.  That should be interesting.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="centos"></category></entry><entry><title>Get started with the security tool OSSEC</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/get-started-with-the-security-tool-ossec" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-02-04T21:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2009-02-04T21:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-02-04:/blog/get-started-with-the-security-tool-ossec</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is: &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=342"&gt;Get started with the security tool OSSEC&lt;/a&gt;, a quick run-down of what OSSEC is and how to use it.

One of the issues I had today was getting corp3/x86_64 installed in a chroot with Mandriva 2009.0 as the host.  Of course, the db4 version had changed, so I had to take advantage of some conversion tools.  urpmi is supposed to do this magically, but it doesn't seem consistent.  Anyways, the problem lies with 2009.0's rpm using a newer version of the database than the older version.  For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# file /var/lib/rpm/Packages 
/var/lib/rpm/Packages: Berkeley DB (Hash, version 9, native byte-order)
# file /chroots/64/cs3/var/lib/rpm/Packages
/chroots/64/cs3/var/lib/rpm/Packages: Berkeley DB (Hash, version 8, native byte-order)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the trick is to convert them from the new format to the old format, which is easy enough to do once you know &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; to do.  On the host (Mandriva 2009 in this case), make sure you have db46_utils and db42_utils installed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# rpm -qa|grep "db.*\-utils"
db46-utils-4.6.21-9mdv2009.0
db42-utils-4.2.52-24mdv2009.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can use this rough-n-dirty script I wrote to convert them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
#
# script to dump and reload the rpm db to convert from hash format 9 to format 8
# for older distribs (think cs3)

for i in $(ls -1); do
    if [ "`file ${i} | grep 9`" != "" ]; then
        db_dump ${i} &gt;${i}.db46
        db42_load ${i}.db42 &lt; ${i}.db46
        mv -f ${i} ${i}.org
        mv -f ${i}.db42 ${i}
    fi
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should fix the errors you would see in the chroot, plus make it so that rpm -qa and friends actually work.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="rpm"></category></entry><entry><title>VMware Server 2.0 offers handy new upgrades</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/vmware-server-20-offers-handy-new-upgrades" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-01-28T18:33:00-07:00</published><updated>2009-01-28T18:33:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-01-28:/blog/vmware-server-20-offers-handy-new-upgrades</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=330"&gt;VMware Server 2.0 offers handy new upgrades&lt;/a&gt; which takes a look at the new(ish) VMware Server 2.0.

&lt;p&gt;I am leaving Mandriva after almost 9 years.  And I quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly 9 years, Vincent Danen will be leaving Mandriva at the end of this month. Again we would like to thank him for his commitment and endeavour whilst at Mandriva. We wish him every success in his future activities. As he said himself, he was also largely “a pain in the developers’ collective backsides with his push for better security in the Mandriva products” and added that we may have forgiven him “because his heart was in the right place” :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have worked for Mandrakesoft/Mandriva since mid-2000. I was responsible for security updates for all released Mandriva products, and coordinated the release of all bugfix and enhancement updates as well. In addition, I tried to be creative and have initiative outside the scope of my “day-to-day” work and setup the old MandrakeSecure web site (a collection of security-related articles), the migration from Warlyzilla to Bugzilla 3.x, the migration from Twiki to MediaWiki and the merger of both official and community wiki’s into one single comprehensive community-driven-yet-official wiki. I also fondly remember many tussles with the other guys in R&amp;amp;D over security and security-related practices that made for interesting and aggressive conversations. =)
Linux-Mandrake was one of the first distributions I used seriously, and Mandriva is still my favorite. I will always have a soft spot for it, and fond memories of my co-workers and friends, and the community Mandriva is blessed to have.” said Vincent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This departure will not leave empty chair, as security is something essential for distribution. We would like to thank oden Eriksson who will be in charge of security team. Welcome back Oden!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much more to say than that.  I am, actually, extremely happy with how this worked out (Oden coming back).  I think it's fantastic that my leaving makes way for Oden to come back.  The only thing I'd like to add is that I'm leaving on my own terms... I have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; been laid off (again).  So this one actually is a good thing (well, maybe not so good for Mandriva, but...).  Anyways, to make a long story short... I'll still be doing security work, and open source stuff, but with a different company.  I'll be wearing a different hat, so to speak.  I'll leave it to the enlightened to figure out what that means.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Remotely monitor servers with the Nagios check_by_ssh plugin</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/remotely-monitor-servers-with-the-nagios-check_by_ssh-plugin" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-01-20T09:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2009-01-20T09:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2009-01-20:/blog/remotely-monitor-servers-with-the-nagios-check_by_ssh-plugin</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=321"&gt;Remotely monitor servers with the Nagios check_by_ssh plugin&lt;/a&gt; which discusses using the check_by_ssh plugin in Nagios to get local plugin results from remote systems, via ssh.

Our community has declined and by the numbers I'll produce, I'm going to say it declined a lot.  I just wrote a quick shell script to parse the number of messages posted to each given list (cooker, expert, and newbie) since 2003 (takes the total for each month and adds them together to get the yearly total).  Of course, we still have 3.5 weeks in December, but I doubt that will make the numbers any more "impressive".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, to put things into perspective, some of this has likely been off-loaded to the Club forums.  I have no idea how many posts are there and how they change from year to year.  It also looks like 2005-&amp;gt;2006 was extremely significant, but my memory is hazy and I don't remember what happened there (well, I'm too lazy to try and figure out what happened there... something negative anyways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT:&lt;/b&gt; Well, a few comments have put this more into perspective, especially for the cooker list.  Anne reminded me that all the bugzilla mails used to go to cooker@ and they don't anymore (having the bugs@ list).  That accounts for the massive drop in "activity" on the cooker list.  And it seems like forums are becoming so much more popular that the mailing lists are dying as a result (not necessarily a bad thing, but at the same time... maybe shut down the "support" lists and go for a straight-forum model?)  Anyways, I'll leave the numbers up as food for thought, but it's not such a "sad metric" as I first said.  My bad.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cooker, the main development list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; cooker-2004: 51977
&lt;li&gt; cooker-2003: 51180
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the expert list, which is a community-driven support list:&lt;/p&gt;

The first book is "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Zen-Simple-Design-Delivery/dp/0321525655"&gt;PresentationZen&lt;/a&gt;" (ISBN: 978-0-321-52565-9) which gives some really great ideas regarding presentation design and delivery of presentations.  While it primarily focuses on design pertaining to things like powerpoint, the "rules" the author talks about (be they rules of design or rules of how humans look at and interact with things) are powerful and applicable to everything, including software design/presentation, or web sites, or anything you &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second book, which I haven't quite finished yet, but which absolutely blew me away, is "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matter-Great-Design-People-Company/dp/0137142447"&gt;Do you matter?  How great design will make people love your company&lt;/a&gt;" (ISBN: 978-0-13-714244-6).  This book is freaking amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking in the context of Mandriva, this is a book every developer, manager, and CEO needs to read.  It's no revelation that we're in a bit of a tough spot and I think (although I don't know for sure) that the CEO is seeking to reinvent Mandriva in some way to make us profitable.  Nothing wrong with the idea, but the execution may be up for debate.  I have no doubt that he can do it (his track record shows he's done it before), but the dynamics are different with this kind of company compared to a traditional company.  Which makes the ideas and things brought up in "Do you matter?" especially relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic premise is that "design" is the be-all and end-all, and the ultimate indicator of good design is customer experience and, more importantly, customer &lt;em&gt;emotion&lt;/em&gt;.  So much so that the first goal and focus, above all else, should be the customer experience/emotion.  It's no surprise to anyone that without customers, no company can survive.  But without happy and satisfied customers, no company can &lt;em&gt;thrive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use one of the authors examples, look at Microsoft vs Apple.  In Microsoft's case, there is extremely poor design... in all aspects of the company (we're not just talking software here, but the whole "culture" -- everything that brings the customer an experience, whether it's good or bad).  The basic consensus of people when they think of Microsoft is like that of the utility company -- they don't really like them, but they need them.  Contrast that to Apple where most people love the products, be it the iPod, iPhone, hardware, OS... whatever.  Apple takes the design-driven company all the way.  From presentations at WWDC, to the box you get your iPod in, to the ease-of-use and look-n-feel of Mac OS X, the customer experience is the first thing in their minds.  And this is why they can charge a premium on their stuff, and people will willingly pay it.  For the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; the end user gets and the emotions it creates (think warm fuzzies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can contrast this to anything.  If you had a rotten experience at one hotel, do you go back?  Or do you try something that is more expensive and find a great experience there?  In the future, do you save a few bucks for a crappy experience, or spend a few more for a great experience?  What about the store you buy groceries from?  Where you buy coffee?  Sure, for some people price rules, but for many people it's all about the experience.  If you buy a car, and it's a really great price and turns out to be utter crap, do you buy another car from this company?  Or do you spend more to buy a better car, with a better experience?  And what is your perception of the first company?  That they sell crappy cars, have poor customer service, and you're damn well going to tell everyone you know to avoid them like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... bottom line is the customer experience and the emotions that experience generates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll probably blog more about this and break it up into a few pieces, but let me leave you with a few questions asked in the book "Do you matter?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Who are you?
&lt;li&gt; What do you do?
&lt;li&gt; Do your customers care if you live or die?
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are potent questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are you?  An open source company?  How about something deeper than that.  An open source company that provides a Linux distribution?  Still pretty vague.  Who are you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;?  An open source Linux company that aims to bring the best possible Linux-based desktop experience?  That sounds pretty good... but is that who we actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do?  Provide a Linux distribution.  Not deep enough.  Think about it.  What do we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;?  What is the actual end &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do your customers care if you live or die?  This is the real question.  With the many blog posts, articles, forum threads, and so forth I have to say that yes, our customers/users care.  Would their lives diminish somewhat if we weren't around?  I'd like to think that yes, it would.  But would it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;?  There's always Ubuntu.  Always Fedora.  I hear OpenSUSE is pretty decent.  What distinguishes &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; to the point that there would be the equivalent of an online "riot" if Mandriva all of a sudden disappeared?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have the answers to these questions.  I do know that we used to have pretty clear goals and really strove to meet them.  And we also had a massive community then too.  Extremely active mailing lists, you name it... Mandrake was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; distro.  And somehow, somewhere, we lost our way.  Maybe we lost our focus on the customer experience.  I don't know.  I do know that it can be turned around... it's not too late.  I think one solution is to become a design-driven company and put the user experience first and foremost, above everything else.  And then design our technology, methodology, philosophy, business practices, etc. around it.  It wouldn't be easy, but it could work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone running a company, or starting a company, or even anyone involved in any kind of organization or community, I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommend reading "Do you matter?".  It provides insight into things I never before thought of and answers the one nagging question I've had for years:  Why is Ubuntu so popular when it's technologically inferior?  I don't mean to start a flamewar or anything here, but the tools Mandriva has blow away anything Ubuntu has.  I've tried it, and didn't like it (possibly because I'm jaded by too much Mandriva exposure, who knows).  But that doesn't change the fact that Ubuntu has had such wild success that to many people Linux == Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes you wonder...  there are a number of tissue-creating companies out there... Scotties, Kleenex, the no-name brands you find at the grocery store.  Yet what is a tissue commonly called, without even thinking?  Kleenex.&lt;/p&gt;

The situation is that the machine that had my mirrored files has been moved somewhere else in order to ease up on rsync being an absolute bandwidth pig (great for downloading, bad when it's throwing nagios checks into fits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I've setup both a private rsync repository to get stuff from and an IP-restricted anonymous FTP.  Both instances didn't work "out of the box" with urpmi.  For one, with rsync it wasn't possible to use the password transparently.  That can be fixed with the $RSYNC_PASSWORD environment variable but it's fugly.  With curl, I'm behind a firewall and so is the remote system, and when it dropped into PASSV mode, it was using the remote's internal 192.* IP address rather than it's external IP, which was causing curl to do a whole lot of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rsync fix consisted of writing the rsync password for the user into /root/.rsyncpw (only root calls urpmi anyways), then putting at the top of /etc/urpmi/urpmi.cfg this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
{
rsync-options: --password-file /root/.rsyncpw
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Pixel, for that.  Which led me to figuring out the curl issue.  At first I set "ftp-skip-pasv-ip" into ~/.curlrc and then realized (when it didn't work) that urpmi calls curl with "-q" which basically tells curl to completely ignore any config files.  Aaarg!  So back to /etc/urpmi/urpmi.cfg to set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
{
curl-options: --ftp-skip-passv-ip
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now everything works peachy (if you need both, like me, then you'd have both options defined, one per line, in between the initial "{ ... }" of the file.  A comment in there indicating that's for custom configuration would be nice.  =)&lt;/p&gt;

This can be evidenced by the comments in my previous blog entry and the many emails I received privately, and the many chats initiated on IRC.  It has been my honor and privilege to work with you guys, and I sincerely appreciate all the extremely kind sentiments that I received.  Despite my "layoff" being short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same short-lived layoff cannot be said about two of my friends, one of which is Adam and the other I will remain nameless unless he decides to share what happened to him.  The amount of support Adam has received via the cooker list and in this &lt;a href="http://forum.mandriva.com/viewtopic.php?t=100768"&gt;Open letter to the CEO&lt;/a&gt; (and Adam's own &lt;a href="http://forum.mandriva.com/viewtopic.php?t=100731"&gt;Leaving thread&lt;/a&gt;) are astounding and if Adam is anything like me, he can't help but appreciate the sentiments expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me think our community is capable of so much more if we just "fed" them properly.  With a little care and feeding, it could sprout into something monumental.  I mean, there are folks in the community that have been there longer than I (I've been working for Mandriva for 8.5 years, and was a contributor for about a year before that).  There are guys there even longer who have seen the ups and downs.  And they've stuck around.  I don't think we have properly expressed our gratitude for that so I'm going to express it now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You guys are steadfast and you bloody rock&lt;/b&gt;.  I can acknowledge that Mandriva would be a shadow of itself without you guys and you deserve more claps on the back and hugs than you've ever gotten.  I can only speak for myself (but I hope I speak for many others!) when I say that the Mandriva community... despite the occasional friction (which happens in any "family")... is truly a marvelous thing.  I echo many community sentiments when it comes to Adam's untimely termination, and having been (temporarily, and by mistake I guess) on the receiving end of that particular axe, I know how it feels (and the feeling definitely sucks).  I hope in this instance the community voice can be heard (&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; heard) because I've watched a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of friends come and go over the years, and it's not something I have ever enjoyed.  But being able to actually experience what each one of them must have felt gives me a greater appreciation for it, which makes me feel for them all the more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, before this gets too gushy, I just wanted to express my sincere appreciation of our small, but potentially very powerful, community.  Thank you guys!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category></entry><entry><title>Use Dovecot for POP3/IMAP services</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/use-dovecot-for-pop3imap-services" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-11-18T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-18T11:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-11-18:/blog/use-dovecot-for-pop3imap-services</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=299"&gt;Use Dovecot for POP3/IMAP services&lt;/a&gt; which discusses how to setup and use Dovecot to provide POP3 and IMAP services.

Sorta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of integrating with bugzilla, we've used the mediawiki framework.  The reasons for this many.  The biggest reason is to make the "Testzilla" as accessible as possible to as many people as possible.  It is also to lower the bar to usability... anyone can look at information on the wiki, but dealing with Testzilla can be trickier (perhaps).  Also, Testzilla itself hasn't been updated in many years, which means a lot of hacking to make it work.  Other solutions were either too complicated (Testopia) or didn't integrate with anything else we currently had (using mediawiki allows us to re-use our authentication from my.mandriva.com).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the basic idea is to have a page per package (urpmi, eclipse, evolution, whatever) and on this page will be testcases -- descriptions of ways to test programs in that package.  Where possible, automated or semi-automated testcases should be written and these get committed to subversion and referenced from the wiki page (the downside here is we need a mechanism to get testcases from people without commit access in, but the upside is it is faster, provides versioning, and won't bog down the wiki with (hopefully!) numerous testcases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already implemented the main page, which can be found at &lt;a href="http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Testing"&gt;wiki.mandriva.com/en/Testing&lt;/a&gt;, and from there you can get to the various testcases (there's only one on there right now).  There is a cookie-cutter template to be used to start new testcases pages, and there are some new macros that make integrating with subversion and bugzilla a little easier/nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I think this has the potential to do really good things for Mandriva, and probably other distributions as well.  With the ability for anyone to create testcase pages, testcases, send an email with an automated testcase attached to our new testcases_@_mandrivalinux_dot_org "exploder" to get committed to subversion, it should be extremely easy and straightforward for people to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that quite a few people on the cooker list expressed an interest in, so I'm hoping this will nicely take off and become yet another useful resource for the Mandriva community.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category></entry><entry><title>Using dnsmasq for DNS and DHCP services</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/using-dnsmasq-for-dns-and-dhcp-services" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-11-04T11:58:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-04T11:58:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-11-04:/blog/using-dnsmasq-for-dns-and-dhcp-services</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=293"&gt;Using dnsmasq for DNS and DHCP services&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses using dnsmasq in place of software like BIND and ISC's dhcpd (or other similar packages).

Tonight it went live on &lt;a href="https://qa.mandriva.com/"&gt;qa.mandriva.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Although it could have gone up 6 weeks ago, due to the release of 2009.0 coming up (which always leads to a massive influx of bug reports both before and after a release) we decided to wait for a few weeks after 2009.0 was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade went quite smooth (due to the preparation and, most importantly, notes taken from the testing almost two months ago), so everything should be up and running in good order.  If there are issues, feel free to comment to me directly or file a bug report.  I think, however, that users will find the new version of Bugzilla contains some welcome features and I also took the opportunity to change the layout somewhat to make it adhere more to web standards (such as making font resizing easier, etc.).  I also condensed the layout somewhat by using the default Bugzilla templates and re-working them from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone likes it.  There will probably be more tweaks coming and rc2 is supposed to be coming out fairly soon from what I've heard, so there will still be changes forthcoming, although I hope they are more minor than what changed tonight.  I'm also hoping this will improve performance somewhat as Bugzilla 3.2 is using InnoDB rather than MyISAM storage types, which from my understanding should also help improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Improve MySQL performance with MySQLTuner</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/improve-mysql-performance-with-mysqltuner" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-24T10:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-10-24T10:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-10-24:/blog/improve-mysql-performance-with-mysqltuner</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=285"&gt;Improve MySQL performance with MySQLTuner&lt;/a&gt; which discusses how to use the MySQLTuner perl script to tune the MySQL server to ensure you're not over-committing resources, that your configuration is sane, and giving helpful pointers on how to optimize your MySQL databases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="mysql"></category></entry><entry><title>Searching with GNOME Do</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/searching-with-gnome-do" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-16T15:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-10-16T15:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-10-16:/blog/searching-with-gnome-do</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's TechMail was &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=284"&gt;Searching with GNOME Do&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses the application launcher GNOME Do, a fantastic little application.

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this release was different in many ways.  For one, I actually got my fingers into the pot in quite a "low level" way, which has never happened before (largely because it was never permitted in the past).  I guess it's probably due to the leaving of some people and perhaps a little more persistence on my part.  I'd also like to think that earlier this year, for the first time in the 8 years of working for Mandriva, I actually met my co-workers in France face-to-face.  Strangely enough, that made an amazingly huge impact on how we relate and work together.  I guess for everyone we now know there are "real people" on the other side of that email message or IRC comment.  I must admit, that face-to-face has really helped and I actually regret not having gone over there before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the development stuff I was involved in this time was some extra pam work (getting the tcb suite integrated which includes pam_tcb (to replace pam_unix) and the extras that come with it to offer a more secure authentication system (although we did find out that poorly designed screensavers meant we had to reduce some of the security benefits of using pam_tcb in order to accommodate their bad design)).  Also, I was the one that incorporated the "know how" from Annvix to get blowfish support into glibc (which inadvertently broke the sha512c support in glibc.. we'll get that fixed eventually).  So now, Mandriva Linux 2009 uses tcb and blowfish passwords by default (although tcb is using the shadow scheme by default, not the tcb scheme).  This is really important since the next version of Corporate Server will be presumably based on 2009, which means it will get tcb support and also means that Corporate Server 5 will be similar to Annvix in some of it's hardening features).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't deny it was trying and time-consuming... =)  Juggling security updates, tcb integration/testing/debugging, and bugzilla maintenance has definitely taken it's toll.  I think the end result is really great though.  I have two systems left to upgrade to 2009 before they're all using it and have had very few problems (some minor issues with the EeePC that eventually got worked through was about it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So congrats to everyone involved with the 2009 development!  From what I can see so far, this is a really good release.  Of course, now that it's released, I'll have a busy 2 weeks ahead of me doing all the bugfix updates, but it's all good.  There's really only two times of the year that I get super busy in a 3 week stretch, and that's the week prior and the two weeks after a release.  This week has gone much smoother than past releases (despite the nasty cold I obtained from the Opeth concert last week!), so I'm hoping that the next two weeks are just as smooth (busy I expect, smooth would be an added bonus).&lt;/p&gt;

I had previously upgraded to 1.5.1 when it came out (from 1.4.x) and found I couldn't commit to svn+ssh urls.  1.5.2 fixes that, but has a naughty habbit of upgrading the repository format behind your back.  So, if you have a working copy you checked out with 1.4.x and then do anything in that working copy it upgrades it to the new format for 1.5.x.  Sadly, it doesn't tell you it's doing this and as a result, those working copies are essentially useless if you need to back out to 1.4.x for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, however, but subversion will upgrade parts of your working copy piecemeal.  For instance, I keep all my web development stuff in ~/svn/websites/.  So after upgrading to 1.5.2 today I did some work in ~/svn/websites/intranet/ and that directory, and it's subdirectories, were upgraded to the new format.  The top-level directory, however, and the rest of the working copy, were not (they were still using format 8 rather than format 9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess with a CLI client this might not matter so much, but it caused me some grief using &lt;a href="http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/"&gt;Cornerstone&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial svn client.

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my interview is up on TechRepublic now and it's 10 minutes and discusses pretty much me.  =)  And some Linux stuff of course... one of her questions was what made Linux hard to use or something (it was hard to hear her during the interview as I kept hearing myself as an echo which was really odd).  Kinda fun to do tho.  Anyways, if you want to know what I would think of Windows if I was stuck on a desert island with it and what my hobbies are or what my most gratifying thing in IT to-date is, then check out the podcast interview:&lt;/p&gt;

You won't see it anywhere official until 2009.0 is released most likely, but having (some) spare time, I wouldn't to put it through the paces in a vmware machine to make sure I can document everything that needs doing and minimize downtime when it comes time to do the actual upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far it's looking pretty good and has some really nice features to it.  Due to the heavy changes in the templates, the templates look more stock now than they did before, which actually manages to clean up a lot of the interface and remove duplicate information.  I also took the opportunity to style it as best I can to respect user font sizing.  The look has changed a little bit along the way as I had to redo all the theming from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, for anyone interested in taking a peek at it or playing around with it a bit before it goes live, you can do so at &lt;a href="http://bugzilla.annvix.ca/"&gt;bugzilla.annvix.ca&lt;/a&gt;.  It's a snapshot of the Mandriva database from a week ago (more or less), and uses the same authentication, etc. as the Mandriva bugzilla.  To prevent confusion, I've turned postfix off so mail notifications aren't being sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-in-all, the upgrade should go fairly smoothly and result in downtime of an hour or two, when it happens.  It could probably be implemented now, but I'd rather wait until 2009.0 is released and things have settled down, so consider this a preview until such a time as it does get moved over.  Any suggestions or whatever are also welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="bugzilla"></category></entry><entry><title>Expanding text with Snippits in Linux</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/expanding-text-with-snippits-in-linux" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-09-09T11:01:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-09-09T11:01:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-09-09:/blog/expanding-text-with-snippits-in-linux</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=265"&gt;Expanding text with Snippits in Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses using Snippits (a ruby app) to do text expansion.

Russ determined that this was the beginning of the end for AppArmor, and I read it with some interest largely because Mandriva has settled on AppArmor as our security solution... largely because it fits with our ideal of making things nice and easy for our users.  So of course, a post that seems to bring doom and gloom about our security solution is something we're interested in reading about because if it's true, then we've invested time and effort into the wrong solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read it and thought it had some interesting points, but I didn't think they were overly valid and it didn't concern me too much.  Yeah, it all seems indicative of the demise of AppArmor (the entire AppArmor team being laid off, the inclusion of SELinux in future products, etc), but there is no real indication that AppArmor is being discontinued or killed off as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Crispin wrote a blog entry responding to it yesterday, entitled &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/crispincowan/archive/2008/09/02/go-ahead-make-my-day.aspx"&gt;Go Ahead, Make My Day&lt;/a&gt;.  Essentially he indicates that there is a bit of paranoia associated with Russ' post in the conclusion he draws about AppArmor's demise.  Of course, Crispin works for Microsoft now and he makes a valid point.  If AppArmor is dying, and since Crispin is working for Microsoft to improve the security mechanisms in Windows' products, then his job is made easier (thus the title).  If Windows security has to compete with the complexity of SELinux, then he indicates his job is all that much easier because all he has to do is make Windows security "easier and more effective to deploy than SELinux".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he makes a good point.  If SELinux is the "standard", then security mechanisms that are both easier to use and easier to deploy will become more popular and will just add fuel to the "Linux is harder than Windows" argument.  I disagree with that argument... personally, I find Linux easier and Windows more frustrating.  But if Windows comes out with something as effective and easy to use as AppArmor, and AppArmor is dead and we're all using SELinux, when people wake up and realize that good security doesn't necessarily mean all the complexities of SELinux and similar systems are a necessity, then the argument would be true: Linux would indeed be harder to use than Windows simply due to the (what I believe will soon become a necessity for anyone using a computer) inherent security designs in a user's chosen operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, while Russ may be right (after all, I don't work for Novell so I can't lay something like this to rest, I can only speculate, as can Russ and also Crispin), I sincerely hope he's wrong.  SELinux may be a fantastic system for those who use it, but for those of us who don't require military-grade security, AppArmor does a very nice job thank-you-very-much of keeping our systems safe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="apparmor"></category><category term="selinux"></category></entry><entry><title>One-time scheduling of tasks with At</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/one-time-scheduling-of-tasks-with-at" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-08-28T09:25:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-08-28T09:25:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-08-28:/blog/one-time-scheduling-of-tasks-with-at</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=260"&gt;One-time scheduling of tasks with At&lt;/a&gt; which discusses one-shot scheduling with the 'at' tool, rather than using something like cron.

This is a fantastic post that breaks down why people should stop comparing Linux to Windows and what newbies can do to make their Linux experience more enjoyable as well as not piss off existing Linux users.  =)  It's a little long, but definitely worth reading (and saving, to point to those people who seem to think Linux should be a FOSS Windows clone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He breaks it down into the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1 Linux isn't exactly the same as Windows&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2 Linux is &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; different from Windows&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3 Culture shock&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3a There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a culture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3b New vs Old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4 Designed for the designer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5 The myth of "user-friendly"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5a Familiar is friendly&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5b Inefficient is friendly&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;6 Imitation vs Convergence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;7 That FOSS thing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very well articulated and quite intelligent.  Most of all, it makes sense... &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; sense.  It would even make sense to the guy whining that Linux isn't exactly the same as Windows, and gives good reasons as to why it a) never will be and b) never &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Dig for more data in the /proc directory</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/dig-for-more-data-in-the-proc-directory" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-03T16:55:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-07-03T16:55:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-07-03:/blog/dig-for-more-data-in-the-proc-directory</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one is over a month old and got lost in my inbox, so I'm posting it now.

&lt;p&gt;France was fun, so thank you again, Anne, for pushing to get me to go.  Very much appreciated.  Despite leaving my iPod in Anne's place, which made for the 8.5hr flight back from France to Toronto quite annoying (that and the kid who wouldn't shut up), I don't think I left anything else behind.  It was great to finally meet folks like fcrozat and blino... saw tvignaud once, I think, but didn't see him much more than that.  Got to meet Francois, and definitely had a blast with Anne, Erwan, and Oden.  Thanks again, Anne and Erwan, for putting up with Oden and I and taking us around to see stuff.  It was great to be able to check out stuff "live" that I would otherwise only see in the Davinci Code.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I have 2hrs to kill at the airport with only 57% battery and no plugins in site.  Oh well.  Not like I'm motivated to do much anyways... I was up at 6:30am Paris time (which is 10:30pm Edmonton time).  So, by the time I get home, it'll have been just under 24hrs (my plane lands at 9:10pm in Edmonton, so by the time I get my baggage and get home, it should be just after 10pm).  Talk about a long day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this was definitely an adventure.  I can definitely do this again... in another 8 years.  =)  Oh, speaking of which, Sunday was my 8-year anniversary with Mandriva (June 1st).  So it was kinda nice to be in Paris on the date of my anniversary with the company.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Security, Open Source Style</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/security-open-source-style" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-02T03:25:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-06-02T03:25:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-06-02:/blog/security-open-source-style</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The announcement just went out for the newly formed oss-security group (which is a similar concept to the private vendor-sec group, but open to anyone interested in helping promote and work with security in open source projects).

For most services, you can get both... for instance, running ssh under ipsvd, with svlogd logging you can see the connections received by ipsvd (so you can see connections, IPs, whether it was rejected or accepted, concurrency, etc.) and still have authentication show up in auth.log or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>Find and fix weak OpenSSL/OpenSSH keys: Debian-based Linux vulnerability</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/find-and-fix-weak-opensslopenssh-keys-debian-based-linux-vulnerability" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-21T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-05-21T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-05-21:/blog/find-and-fix-weak-opensslopenssh-keys-debian-based-linux-vulnerability</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In light of the recent Debian debacle and to get the word out to more people, this week's Techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=210"&gt;Find and fix weak OpenSSL/OpenSSH keys: Debian-based Linux vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; which more or less reiterates what happened with the Debian OpenSSL... fun... and points to the dowkd.pl script that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In light of the recent Debian debacle and to get the word out to more people, this week's Techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=210"&gt;Find and fix weak OpenSSL/OpenSSH keys: Debian-based Linux vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; which more or less reiterates what happened with the Debian OpenSSL... fun... and points to the dowkd.pl script that can be used to test for weak keys.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="openssl"></category><category term="openssh"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>The path of least-patching</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/the-path-of-least-patching" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-17T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-05-17T09:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-05-17:/blog/the-path-of-least-patching</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been an amusing morning reading more takes on the Debian OpenSSL issue.

While I was in the know before most others due to vendor-sec, and was able to quickly verify this didn't affect Mandriva, the fallout still continues.  For those that think otherwise, this is a big issue, and a big mistake, and outlines some very important things about open source development.  First, &lt;a href="http://www.gergely.risko.hu/debian-dsa1571.en.html"&gt;this fellow&lt;/a&gt; thinks that the Debian OpenSSL maintainer should be changed, that the individual who caused this catastrophe should be booted as maintainer.  Honestly, he's probably right.  If this was something that happened in a corporate setting to affect the security of an individual company to the degree that this thing did, you know for fact that person would be canned within minutes.  Should we have more leeway just because it's open source and he's not being paid?  Frankly, if you're not good at cryptography and don't fully understand the code and aren't willing to work closely with upstream, you shouldn't be farting around with the package.  OpenSSL and other stuff like that is pretty major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was maintaining packages on Mandriva, I was the openssh maintainer.  I caught crap from Theo on a few occasions due to modifications Mandriva had made to openssh, despite the fact that I wasn't the one who made those changes.  As a result, this "header" has been in openssh's spec for the last seven years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
## Do not apply any unauthorized patches to this package!
## - vdanen 05/18/01
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I've not maintained openssh in quite a few years and it looks like the current/existing maintainers haven't been paying attention (or don't care) about that particular notice.  There are 8 patches to openssh, only 3 of which would be there if I were the maintainer.  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another scathing post to the OpenSSL issue, with some interesting comments, is on the Practical Technology blog, entitled &lt;a href="http://practical-tech.com/operating-system/linux/open-source-security-idiots/"&gt;Open-Source Security Idiots&lt;/a&gt;.  There are probably others, but I think two is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outlines one reason why I took the philosophy of "least-patching" when it came to Annvix.  The things that required patching usually had the patches submitted upstream for inclusion.  Some made it, some didn't.  I get there are some distro-specific features that authors won't want to incorporate.  For instance, svlogd would always log in UTC time which to me is useless... when I'm looking at logs and looking at dates, I'm looking for &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; time, not UTC time.  So I patched that.  But that's not how upstream wants it so, fine, that's one patch maintained by me.  But when it comes to big things, or things I don't understand, or crypto or security, etc. these things I deal with upstream and/or just plain old don't touch.  I'm not a C  or C++ expert, I'm not a cryptography specialist, and I won't pretend to be one.  If user X wants fancy feature Y in crypto package Z, well, they can deal with upstream to get it or provide something blessed by upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, take the recently-added blowfish support to glibc.  To add it to Mandriva was quite trivial as I've been using it on Annvix for years.  How does it work?  I have very little idea.  But I worked closely with Solar Designer of the Openwall GNU/Linux project to make sure it worked and worked properly in Annvix because it was needed for the TCB support I had added (and which I'll be adding to Mandriva shortly).  Now, Solar definitely knows about this stuff, so working with him to get it right helped.  Yeah, I suffered through being implied an idiot, but that's ok because I didn't come out to sound like any kind of expert.  Really, I'm just a glorified patch-monkey, not some deep-crypto-coder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my point is that it's important to work with upstream for this stuff as much a possible, and taking the path of least-patching makes good sense.  It avoids problems like this.  After all, you might be the "maintainer" of such-and-such software, but upstream is the author, and presumably understands and knows the code more than you.  This is another reason to send patches upstream.  If they're rejected, think about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they're rejected.  It might be for good cause.  You may also get the peer review to make the patch better; upstream won't always want to take your changes, but if there's something totally wrong with it, they'll let you know and maybe toss in a name or two for good measure.  But, really, that humiliation is better than this one... by no stretch of the imagination would I want to be Kurt Roeckx (the Debian openssl maintainer) right now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="openssl"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Watch out Mandriva...

I've been using some tools, like iurt, on the secteam buildbox for a while now, but I've not had the need to use repsys or mdvsys.  So I started playing with them yesterday.  For starters, someone needs to make rpm-build a dependency on repsys... it doesn't work too well without rpm-build (missing macros and such).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this morning I lost my virginity and used repsys and mdvsys to submit a new version of AIDE to cooker.  New version, and integrated the AIDE+gpg scripts from Annvix, so now AIDE is actually a good and trustworthy alternative to Tripwire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess now that I'm no longer working on Annvix there are a few things I should submit so I don't have to maintain them individually and outside of cooker/contrib.  Things like exim, execline, a better runit (although Mandriva's dietlibc is broken and runit doesn't build under dietlibc anymore which is a real shame)... there are a few others.  I'd like to submit rsec (the not-so-obnoxious alternative to msec), but somehow I think people would whine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also planning to import some stuff from Annvix that originally came from Openwall; stuff like tcb, pam_passwdqc, etc.  Of course, this will involve patching glibc and shadow-utils... possibly util-linux-ng, but I don't recall.  Of course, TCB is far superior to traditional shadow passwords and completely backwards compatible (with the patches, of course).  People will probably complain about that too, but whatever.  The patches don't force the use of TCB, but they do allow it to work.  The patches to glibc would incorporate blowfish password support, which is important.  Annvix, SUSE, and Openwall (and probably others) have had blowfish support for crypt for years.  Mandriva still doesn't.  Will probably hit resistance there too, but maybe I'll just submit it without telling anyone... that seems to be the "appropriate" way of doing things around here, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think we need to implement a spec "style" policy.  Good lord our specs are disgusting.  Functional, perhaps, but hideous to look at.  I now remember why I spent so much time and was so anal about formatting of specs in Annvix... it sure makes life simpler when every spec you follow uses the exact same style format.  I imagine Annvix wasn't the only distro with an anal style policy on specfiles... surely others must think that consistency in formatting saves time? &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="rpm"></category></entry><entry><title>zsh history</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/zsh-history" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-04-20T14:04:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-04-20T14:04:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-04-20:/blog/zsh-history</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Saw a few others on Planet Mandriva doing this so I figured what the heck, I'd do the same.

It's a quad-core xeon 2.13GHz with 8GB RAM.  To put things into perspective, this machine will replace 3 different machines eventually... one to do the administrative stuff (AMD Athlon64 2.2GHz w/ 2GB RAM), one to build 32bit updates (dual core P4 3GHz w/ 1GB RAM), and one to do 64bit updates (AMD Athlon64 2GHz w/ 1GB RAM).  Yes... I've been working with those machines for quite a few years now.  Current kernel and OOo builds have definitely necessitated an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put things further into perspective, I compiled the Annvix kernel (2.6.22.19) on the two build machines and this new one (and also on my old trusty dual-opteron 1.8GHz w/ 2GB RAM that was my Annvix build machine... since I'm no longer working on Annvix, I was initially thinking of making that machine a new Mandriva updates build machine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 32bit build machine compiled it in 36:35.99m using 102% CPU.  The 64bit build machine did it in 28:15.13m using 97% CPU.  The dual-opteron did it in 23:47.04m with 152% CPU.  This new quad-core xeon did it in 12:01.66m with 229% CPU.  (Note that this is a single SMP kernel, not the multi-flavour kernels Mandriva builds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm absolutely tickled pink by this.  =)  This will definitely make secteam more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it also showed that 2008.1 will not boot on this system (at least with the 64bit Free DVD installer).  2008.0 had no problem booting and installing.  Unfortunately, doing my urpmi --auto-select to upgrade from 2008.0 to 2008.1, it also looks as though 2008.1's kernel is to blame... the system is not booting at all now.  =(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  using acpi=off makes it work, so the installer will run now (and the 2008.1 kernel boots, but the initrd is hosed giving the same error as 2008.0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT2:  using acpi=off works, my quad-core has turned into a single-core.  Definitely not cool.  And acpi=ht doesn't work... it hangs.  So according to &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingACPI"&gt;the Ubuntu wiki&lt;/a&gt;, this means that "the issue is in the ACPI table parsing code itself, or perhaps the SMP code".  Gustavo is telling me that there were some ACPI changes in 2.6.24, so that is most likely the culprit here.&lt;/p&gt;

I have 7 md devices, and invariably on each boot, one or two would fail to assemble for some reason.  Poking around in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit, the md initialization was completely removed and I suspect udev is supposed to take care of it instead.  Well, after having to boot a dozen times to get the silly system up and running, I decided to put &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; the md initialization in rc.sysinit so that at least I know on subsequent reboots the system will actually come up fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the only downside I've seen so far is installation on a fully md system (everything is RAID1 -- /boot, swap, you name it).  Well, the installer is supposed to use LILO when /boot is a md device according to Pixel, but the installer doesn't actually install LILO, so you get bootloader install errors.  Booting into rescue mode and doing the grub install manually fixes the problem (but you have to do the full grub install as not even the grub support files are installed in /boot/grub and no menu.lst is generated either).  Then the system will come up.  Note to developers:  I've been using grub on fully-RAID1 systems for years.  You do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need LILO for this.  grub works just peachy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still something wonky with my menu.lst tho as installkernel fails to update menu.lst when installing a new kernel.  Not quite sure what the deal there is, seems like a pretty strange error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@hades servers]# installkernel 2.6.24.4-server-1mnb

&lt;p&gt;Switching my servers from Annvix to Mandriva is absolutely maddening.  The biggest problem is dynamic uid/gid mappings.  Do you know how frustrating it is to have apache uid 77 on one machine and uid 92 on another?  Or svn is gid 75 on one and gid 76 on another?  It's driving me absolutely bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why on earth we switched, years ago, from static uid/gid mapping to dynamic mapping is beyond me.  It's the most utterly retarded thing possible.  Consistency between different installs is not a bad thing people!  Sure, the original argument was "it keeps the passwd file smaller" but... news flash!  It's &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to specify the uid or gid in the spec file and it's trivial to keep a publicly-accessible list of the map so people don't grab inappropriate uid or gid numbers.  I mean, seriously... I implemented that in Annvix over 4 years ago!  It was one of the first things I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, mention this and developers/maintainers poo-poo the idea (no, that's not theoretical... after I did it Annvix I proposed it again and... gasp... it was poo-poo'd... like usual).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaaaahhh!  If I had a brick wall handy I'd be smashing my head in it at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

If you've been reading here for a while, you know that the machine I throw to the dogs is my Toshiba Libretto.  Asus may have a cute thing with the Eee PC, but I'll stick with my Libretto.  You'll also recall that with every release since I've had the Libretto, there is always something that needs to be tweaked or that just doesn't work out quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, 2008.1 works completely out-of-the-box.  X resolution is properly set, madwifi is properly setup, the SD card reader works.. everything just works.  The only thing I don't know about is the fingerprint scanner, but I'm not sure what we have for biometric packages, if anything (but I also haven't really looked beyond MCC because anything else would be a "hack").  Now, I haven't played with it extensively yet... today was a cooker upgrade from when I was bored one night a few weeks ago and had installed beta2 on it, but then never had the opportunity to play with it more.  So after a urpmi --auto-select, reboot, and some playing, I'm impressed.  Metisse was a little slow (but looked pretty sharp)... definitely wouldn't use it everyday but it makes for nice "check this out" factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE4 looks pretty nifty...  Tried to urpmi task-kde4 and got some conflicting files amongst various packages so didn't get everything installed, but it still runs well enough (I think I'm just missing some office-related stuff).  KDE3 looks... well.. the same.  So does GNOME, but in the case of GNOME that's ok because GNOME always looks sharp.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, as of right now, I'm impressed.  I've had to do exactly zero dickering to make everything (except the fingerprint reader) work.  Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real test will be the HP tablet, but that's going to run 2008 until 2008.1 is done as that's a production machine and the Libretto is my "road warrior" machine and since I'm plunked in this super-comfy chair all day and really only leave the house when I'm going stir crazy or need to buy coffee or water, it's ok if something breaks on that machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, congrats to the development team!  So far so good.  Sound works (I don't care about PulseAudio vs the other audio systems as much as some do.. I just care if it works), so that's a good thing too.  Will throw some mp3's and video files on there tomorrow to see how well the other apps work.  So, short of task-kde4 (which is in contribs, although that shouldn't be an excuse), everything is working great.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category></entry><entry><title>Encrypting and decrypting files with GnuPG</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/encrypting-and-decrypting-files-with-gnupg" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-03-01T17:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-03-01T17:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-03-01:/blog/encrypting-and-decrypting-files-with-gnupg</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's TechMail tip was &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=168"&gt;Encrypting and decrypting files with GnuPG&lt;/a&gt;, which covers some stuff about using gpg to deal with encryption of files (instead of just using gpg for mail).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="gpg"></category></entry><entry><title>Secure temporary files in Linux</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/secure-temporary-files-in-linux" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-03-01T17:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-03-01T17:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-03-01:/blog/secure-temporary-files-in-linux</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=171"&gt;Secure temporary files in Linux&lt;/a&gt; which discusses how to properly secure temporary files, using things like loopback filesystems, separate partitions for /tmp and using appropriate mount flags.

It's primarily a wiki of various security-related information and a mailing list for OSS vendors and authors to be able to discuss public security issues.  The concept is moderately similar to full-disclosure or bugtraq, but is aimed particularly at OSS vendors and authors.  Because of the sensitivity of some issues on vendor-sec (pre-disclosure issues, etc.) having a large number of people on vendor-sec isn't really viable, so oss-security aims to fill that gap by allowing those interested in security (and not necessarily members of vendor security teams) to discuss public issues, coordinate audits, or whatever.  The aim is to have a stronger OSS security community and to allow people with interest and expertise to get involved, without having to adhere to the strict "code" associated with vendor-sec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.openwall.com/"&gt;Openwall Project&lt;/a&gt; for offering to provide the infrastructure to host this thing.  The wiki is up at &lt;a href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/"&gt;oss-security.openwall.org&lt;/a&gt; and while it's still rather small at the moment, the hope is that various vendors and authors will get on board and provide the information we're looking for.  Particularly, the wiki is a place where people who have found a security issue in something or are want to figure out where, for example, Mandriva or SUSE advisories get posted, can easily do so.  It's mostly a dictionary of links right now, although I believe the goal is to have some "best practices" type information and other pertinent info to help vendors and such.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a bit of a quirky setup for Nagios where I run the local system checks on remote systems via netcat, ipsvd, and a script to handle the query.  This allows me to monitor remote drive space, current users, total processes, and current load.  Using hddtemp, I can now monitor the temperature of the drives in those machines (which also gives me an idea of how hot/cold the server room itself is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may need some tweaking to work with other Nagios setups, but shouldn't be too hard to adapt.  One of these days I'll do a writeup on my Nagios configuration.  Anyways, the wrapper script is as follows.  It could probably be optimized a bit more, but it works well enough.  Wordpress doesn't handle the indents very well, so keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    if [ "${temp}" -ge "${warn}" ]; then

&lt;p&gt;I don't normally blog about the security stuff we do, so why is this different?  Well, this one was more interesting than your run-of-the-mill patch-test-release cycle.  We actually got to do some testing and fixing on our own which, while not a first for Mandriva, is certainly rare.  Usually we're the recipients of other people's patches.  This time, we found something, and we fixed it, got to submit it upstream, etc.  This might be a normal thing for maintainers, but not so normal for the secteam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I've always wanted to be able to have the resources to do more "research" in looking for vulns to fix things proactively.  This gave me a taste of it, and I like it.  =)  Too bad the resources aren't there to do more of this sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also nice seeing your name associated with upstream fixes.  The &lt;a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/index.php?6413"&gt;patch information&lt;/a&gt; gives Mandriva credit for the fix, which is great for us.  Also lets Gustavo puff his chest a bit with a job well-done.  My name is in there, but didn't need to be... I guess that's the benefits of being a middle-man/proxy/manager sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, it's back to the usual grind, but this was an interesting little side-track.  I guess the next "big thing" isn't so much package auditing, but is a departure from the normal grind... get to figure out how to setup and use iurt to build security updates.  Should be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Get started with GnuPG</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/get-started-with-gnupg" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-02-06T10:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-02-06T10:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-02-06:/blog/get-started-with-gnupg</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=165"&gt;Get started with GnuPG&lt;/a&gt;, a quick primer on another of my favourite tools: GnuPG.

Of course, the real question then becomes what happens to AppArmor?  I suspect AppArmor will survive as a result of this, and Crispin will probably continue to work on it somewhat, although it may end up being more of a free-time project than anything else (of course, Novell owns AppArmor so they probably won't be giving it the boot anytime soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell should never have gotten rid of the ex-Immunix folks.  I guess Novell's loss is now Microsoft's gain.

Unfortunately, it's primarily a Windows environment.  It was 100% windows until I donated a linux server to handle their backups.  But now that the machine is in there, it opens the door to using and utilizing a number of web-based applications.  I already have mediawiki setup on the thing so that they can start utilizing it for notes and items to each other.  It will take some time for them to use this system, and be comfortable with it, but that's ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, right now they're looking into software to handle donations and receipts (because they are an independent school), and also some limited CRM capabilities; i.e. to have information on donors and the ability to quickly print out mailing labels based on certain criteria (i.e. did the person attend the golf tournament, did they donate in the last year, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest thing I've found so far is ChurchLedger, but my wife has played with it a bit and it's too geared to churches, and too complicated for her to use.  I'm trying to convince her (and, by proxy, the school) to use something open so that if, in 5 years, things go wrong or the developer of the app they're currently looking at dies, etc. that they have something easy to maintain and that anyone can look into.  Originally they wanted her to develop something in Access and were going to pay for courses for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions on something that could be used here, meeting the criteria of being able to print out donation receipts, mailing labels, perhaps some rudimentary bulk mailing feature, that is preferably written in PHP (or perl), and uses PostgreSQL or MySQL to store the data?  I had considered whipping up something on my own, but don't have the time right now to invest/donate something like that.  Any suggestions of potential candidates would be useful.  It has to be web-based as they're currently using windows on the desktop systems, but I'm hoping that will change over the next year or so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Use OpenNTPD for time synchronization</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/use-openntpd-for-time-synchronization" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-10T19:52:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-01-10T19:52:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-01-10:/blog/use-openntpd-for-time-synchronization</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail tip is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=153"&gt;Use OpenNTPD for time synchronization&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses using OpenNTPD (from the OpenSSH team) instead of the older (and more bloated) NPTD.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>Where's the shareware?</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/wheres-the-shareware" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-09T21:55:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-01-09T21:55:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2008-01-09:/blog/wheres-the-shareware</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day of &lt;a href="http://www.macheist.com/"&gt;MacHeist 2&lt;/a&gt;, an event where you can get 10 shareware OS X applications for $49USD (all the apps regularly priced at $343.75USD).

That's a pretty spanking good deal.  This year's heist looks pretty good... last year's was better, but this year isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that got me thinking about shareware.  There are essentially three schools of software:  freeware, shareware, and commercial.  For the mac user, there's plenty of all three, same for the windows user.  It seems like, by and large, the Linux crowd is stuck with two: freeware (ala open source) and commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being no stranger to shareware, I was struck today as to why there is very little shareware for Linux.  We have an insane amount of "freeware" via open source software.  There's also plenty of commercial software... stuff like Oracle, VMware, and so forth come immediately to mind.  However, it seems to me like the commercial stuff is marketed directly to the enterprise sector, and the the freeware stuff is for everyone (everyone else?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appeals to mid- and large-sized business who want the reassurance of support and longevity; I get why commercial software exists.  It will always exist, whether you dream of a utopian all-open-source-society or not.  Open source (aka freeware) appeals to everyone.  When you think of the support options for open source, it's by and large community-based or DIY (do-it-yourself).  I can install a web application written in PHP and not worry if the developer takes off because I have the source (and the skills) to update and enhance it as I see fit.  As a result, I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; open source.  But I'm the average user your typical Linux distribution is trying to target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of shareware is strange.  When I look at the mac, knowing that a lot of the "guts" are open source applications, I see that right out of the box I get the commercial (the GUI interface and the apps Apple has written) and the open source (apache, PHP, perl, bash, etc. right there where I want it).  However, were I a newcomer to the mac, would I immediately be looking for the open source stuff?  The commercial stuff?  The average person would be looking for the shareware and would wander over to places like &lt;a href="http://www.macupdate.com"&gt;MacUpdate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/"&gt;VersionTracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as a newcomer to Linux, there is nothing like that for me.  There are probably, what, less than one hundred shareware applications for Linux?  Maybe two hundred?  Quite possibly a lot less than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about a mac, and the software you use on it, you're thinking about some high quality applications.  Yet most of those are shareware.  Now, I'm not saying Linux is lacking in high quality applications -- there is some damn fine open source stuff out there.  But, coming from a windows or mac background, I dare say most of that isn't desktop applications.  The really solid stuff is the server-related stuff (samba, apache, perl, etc.).  Some really good desktop applications exist, sure... Firefox and Thunderbird are nothing to shake your head at, and KDE and GNOME are good desktop interfaces.  But what if I wanted a good RSS reader?  Or a file manager?  Or something like a really slick CSS editor?  On Linux, I'm stuck with the open source; on a mac or windows, if the open source stuff available doesn't cut it, I have options (shareware and commercial).  This makes me think back to the "choice is good" mantra that comes with distributions shipping a dozen different text editors.  If there is a half-dozen so-so RSS readers, and I happen to dislike or have issues with all of them, where then is my choice?  Do I even have the option to look for something that costs a few dollars, where the developer has more than just "warm fuzzies" as motivation?  (This motivation, BTW, makes some insane things happen... money is one of the best motivators a person can get).  If we don't have that middle-tier of application development (shareware), do we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have all the choice we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the zealotry behind "everything open source" is coming to bite us in the arse and scare off shareware developers.  After all, it used to be that if you ran Linux, the perception was "free free free!".  Everything must be free.  For someone to develop a quality piece of software and then ask for money, or make it available and cripple it until it was registered, I'm sure they'd be attacked by a virtual mob ready to kick them in the face.  Why?  Because this is open source, dammit!  Your greedy mentality isn't wanted here!  Yeah, I'd yell some more, but I have to call the Oracle support staff regarding a problem with our Oracle database we were alerted to.  Down with the greedy shareware authors!  If you're going to write something, make it open source!  Yes?  Hello?  Oracle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm well aware that for the last couple of years advocates have been proclaiming that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; year would be the year of the Linux desktop.  And every year it isn't.  Every year the desktops do amazing things, don't get me wrong, so one has to wonder where the short end of the stick lies.  Is it the kernel and hardware support?  Lack of popular games?  Not enough polish on the desktop interface?  We've all heard the varied excuses as to why it wasn't the time, or what needs weren't met, etc.  Sure, some of it is definitely true, but some of it is bunk.  Not enough desktop polish?  GNOME has a great interface... there's a lot of polish there.  It works and works well (I'm not a big fan of KDE, but I suspect it's in the same camp).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm seriously wondering if all the "free free free!" foaming at the mouth has driven off a developer community that is moderately or even purely motivated by profit, but don't have the resources to be "commercial software developers".  A lot of this really great mac software is developed by single individuals or small teams and they produce some high class stuff.  And the funny thing... OS X is not very old, in the grand scheme of things.  Linux has been around longer than OS X has.  Yes, Apple's control over the interface and hardware, the applications Apple has written, aggressive advertising, etc. have definitely helped propel OS X along to the point that it's making more of a dent now in Windows sales than it ever has in the past.  But there is still fundamental cost associated with it that Linux users can avoid.  Having said that, it's the developer community that drives Apple, and Apple makes sure (for the most part) to seriously acknowledge and foster that community.  Without all of those third-party shareware applications, the mac isn't much to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a great open source development community around us.  But can Linux really take on Apple and Microsoft with just a two-tiered development community?  When the two operating systems that are the biggest competition both have large three-tiered development communities?  Have we so focused on one camp to the almost complete exclusion of another that it can never come back?  If shareware developers started developing shareware for Linux, would people even buy it?  Or would the mantra of "free free free!" drive them, and their software, away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know.  I'm not a marketing guy.  But it's something to consider.  Especially in light of events like MacHeist where in less than 24hrs, as of this moment, there have been 2648 bundles sold.  This, and the fact that there is so much shareware available for the mac, tell me that shareware as a concept is extremely viable.  I couldn't even begin to count how much I've spent on shareware applications for DOS, OS/2, Windows, and more recently OS X.  For 15+ years now I've been buying shareware.  Sure, not all shareware is great (or even good -- the motivation of money does not a good developer make), but the nice thing with it is you can try before you buy.  If it doesn't do it for you, don't buy it.  I've spent some hard-earned dollars on some fantastic software developed by very small companies and individuals, and I don't see myself stopping.  I've bought commercial software, but where a shareware solution existed that did as much, or close to as much, as a commercial offering, I've usually gone for the shareware stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Linux, I can count what I've paid for (other than operating systems (yes, I've bought boxed copies of Mandriva, SUSE, Yellowdog, etc.)) on one hand.  I've bought Zend Studio, and I've bought VMware.  Oh, and Komodo.  All of those were commercial software, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just food for thought.  I'm musing here, but I wonder if our two-tiered development community is what's making Linux trip on it's own feet when the Mac has a three-tiered development community and increases market share every year and Windows has the same three-tiered community and, while it's market share may be (arguably) slightly on the decline, surely it isn't enough for anyone to cheer over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... does Linux need shareware to compete?  And if does, will the open source purists and zealots even permit that middle-tier development community to survive, much less thrive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess at this point I need to add the obligatory "flame on!", right?  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Annvix 3.0-RELEASE released</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/annvix-30-release-released" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-12-30T16:28:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-12-30T16:28:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-12-30:/blog/annvix-30-release-released</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just finished releasing &lt;a href="http://blog.annvix.org/index.php?/archives/93-Annvix-3.0-RELEASE-Freya-now-available.html"&gt;Annvix 3.0-RELEASE&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, &lt;a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com/5100-1035-6142224.html"&gt;Automate configuration backups with subversion&lt;/a&gt; is a quick way to use subversion to track configuration file changes.  It can be retro-fitted to work with anything really, but the sample is for committing and tracking changes to /etc/ in subversion.  I use it on all of my servers; it's awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another subversion-related tip is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=73"&gt;Automate subversion backups&lt;/a&gt; which goes into handling automatic backups of subversion repositories.  Having experienced subversion corruption (once only, thankfully), I find this is a great way to ensure you have a working backup of subversion at all times.  It's a little brief, but does the job.  I've expanded on that to also dump single commits every time they're made so you have an outside-of-svn-constant-backup of stuff that can be used to reconstruct the svn repository easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me knows that I'm overly cautious and almost anal when it comes to backups of stuff.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="subversion"></category></entry><entry><title>Filter for unwanted mail and mailing lists with procmail</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/filter-for-unwanted-mail-and-mailing-lists-with-procmail" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-12-18T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-12-18T12:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-12-18:/blog/filter-for-unwanted-mail-and-mailing-lists-with-procmail</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechRepublic tip is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=148"&gt;Filter for unwanted mail and mailing lists with procmail&lt;/a&gt;, which goes into procmail recipes a little more in depth than last week's tip (size restraints on these tips sucks sometimes, so we end up with two-parters).

I always like these kinds of articles because too many people assume that all you can do is code.  Well, development is good, but there are a whole host of other things that can be done too.  His list, in short, is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use popular open-source software (even if you're not using Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure open source is considered as an option when your business specifies new systems (obviously this is applicable to very few people -- not too many people have the clout in their workplace to make sure &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; is an option)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join online open-source discussion forums (mailing lists are good here too)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to code (well, learning is ok... what you do with it is what matters and this is no more helpful to open source as it is to proprietary source)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help document and debug (this is essential, I think -- for myself, I'm not much of a programmer, but I do have some mad documentation skills that have been put into effect many times)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to open source events (this is good -- show support when you can and as often as you can, and face-to-face real-life support is much more meaningful than some online poll)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put your money where your mouth is (this also is very important, and too many people figure because something is open source that no money should be or needs to be involved...  but open source developers need to eat just as much as the proprietary guys do)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look around for other ways to use the open-source model (he notes wikipedia here, and while this is an interesting idea, I'm not too sure on the practicality of it, or how contributing to wikipedia helps, say, the apache or php or kernel developers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report bugs -- don't just complain about them (this is more important than most people realize... if you whine about a problem and never report it, how is it supposed to get fixed?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think things through, and be honest (I think he should have stayed with "9 things"... this one is a bit hokey, but ok)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, some of these ideas are new (but wierd) and some of them are old and just as relevant (and requiring reminding as the whole OSS steamboat chugs forward picking up new folks every day) today as they were 8-9 years ago when I started getting involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Sicko Film</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/sicko" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-28T01:24:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-11-28T01:24:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-11-28:/blog/sicko</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little late to the party here, but I just finished watching Sicko, a film by Michael Moore.

I sincerely thank God that a) I'm a pretty healthy individual (lack of exercise and such aside) and b) that I live in Canada.  I don't think I've ever been so grateful to be Canadian until I saw that.  People complain about long waits and what-have-you with the Canadian health-care system and it's true to some extent but to be honest, I don't know of anyone who has died here because of a long wait.  When my dad was diagnosed with colo-rectal cancer, he was in treatment almost immediately.  The only reason he didn't have surgery sooner was due to the fact that they wanted the radiation and chemo treatments to shrink the tumor before the operation.  But the time it took for the family doctor to think there was a problem to him seeing a specialist to him starting treatment was the matter of a few short weeks (2-3 I believe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother-in-law with lung cancer was dealt with very quickly.  Her recent hip-replacement surgery was dealt with quickly.  There was no months of waiting for either surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look at that film and know for fact that if I lived in the US, I'd be under a monumental pile of debt right now simply due to when my daughter was born.  We spent a week in the hospital because she had fluid in her lungs and was unable to breathe properly.  As it stands now, any debt I have is of my own making and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; due to medical expenses.  My parents would probably be living in my basement with the surgeries my dad has gone through for his cancer and after that a heart issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it ridiculous in the extreme that a country as wealthy as the US treats their people so poorly and that corporate greed outweighs the rights of the "little people" and that the government who is supposedly in place to &lt;em&gt;serve&lt;/em&gt; people is actually abusing them by allowing this kind of thing to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup, I'm damn proud to be Canadian.  I'll pay my $88/mo for my Alberta Healthcare premium (which covers me, my wife, and my daughter) -- gladly. And I'll pay my recordable media tax too -- we all know what goodness that affords my music habit.  All joking aside, I think this has solidified and already solid belief that no one (sorry, Google) can pay me enough to work for them if it means relocating to the US.

I suppose that's the creative license that having a blog entitles people, but it still irks me because in a lot of cases it's completely unfounded and could easily be cleared up with a simple email question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wandering around and found &lt;a href="http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/21155"&gt;Battle of the Titans: Mandriva 2008 vs OpenSUSE 10.3&lt;/a&gt;.  Interesting read; I like how Mandriva comes out on top although there are definitely areas we can improve upon.  But what else is new? &lt;b&gt;Every&lt;/b&gt; distro has areas that can be improved upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, in the comments I'm reading: "the sad part is an unexpected secrecy in Mandriva", which refers to a bug aliased as CVE-2007-2834, for which the individual didn't have access to. Of course, he starts a FUD-based tirade on his own blog &lt;a href="http://beranger.org/index.php?page=diary&amp;2007/10/19/12/33/32-starting-from-susan-s-mandriva-v"&gt;Planete Beranger&lt;/a&gt;.  And this is where the fun begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, Beranger decides to go on a tirade about hidden bug reports.  Good thing Adam is around to smack some sense into him (I'm assuming Beranger is a him, but I don't really know).  He has some nice nuggets like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anyway, the sad part is an unexpected secrecy with Mandriva: try a search for http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-2834 and you will get a blunt:
You are not authorized to access bug #33759.

Huh?!

And indeed, the access to http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=33759 is denied!

I very much dislike this huge blunder from Mandriva's part: are they trying to play Microsoft, or what?! Hiding bug reports is unacceptable!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm...  well, if he would have bothered to ask anyone, he would have had his answer fairly quickly as to what the deal with that report is.  The contents of this bug report is, exactly:&lt;/p&gt;

Integer overflow in the TIFF parser in OpenOffice.org (OOo) before 2.3
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a TIFF file with
crafted values of unspecified length fields, which triggers allocation
of an incorrect amount of memory, resulting in a heap-based buffer
overflow.

Fixed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty spicy stuff, no?  In fact, if you looked it up on &lt;a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2834"&gt;MITRE's website, entry CVE-2007-2834&lt;/a&gt; you'll see the same thing (minus the "Fixed" comment).  In fact, you'll see more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and lookee here, you'll also see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
MANDRIVA:MDKSA-2007:186
URL:http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2007:186
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what happens when you follow that link?  Well, you get to see that it was fixed in CS3, 2007.0, and 2007.1.  Doesn't indicate 2008, of course, because it was fixed when 2008 was cooker, thanks to this (public) report: &lt;a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=33824"&gt;Bugzilla bug #33824&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, all of this could have been settled with a simple email.  Instead, this Beranger fellow starts spreading FUD, looks like he's seriously lacking in the investigation skills department, and generally makes a fool of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's the deal with the private bug report?  Well, it's 1) boring and 2) an internal tracker.  Yes, the security team uses bugzilla to track issues we need to deal with.  Are these safe for public consumption?  Sometimes.  Are they interesting to the public?  Not really.  I think the &lt;b&gt;result&lt;/b&gt; is more interesting.  For instance, I think that the actual advisory, MDKSA-2007:186, would be far more interesting than a bug report that's essentially a carbon-copy of the original CVE entry.  Now, in this case, perhaps bug #33824 could have had the alias CVE-2007-2834 as it was issued to resolve only one bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we do when an advisory deals with more than one CVE or issue?  We can't give one bug two different aliases.  So, let's look at bug #34610 (libvorbis).  If you look at the dependencies, you'll see bugs #33871 and #33872.  Both are private.  Both have aliases for the two CVE's fixed in that advisory.  Both use them as aliases.  Sure, I could remove the aliases from the CVE-entry-clone-reports, but I can't assign both to one bug.  Or what about the kernel?  Or firefox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is, internal tracking bugs have absolutely no relevance to anyone outside of the security team, so no, I don't see the point in making them public, even after they're dealt with.  It's nothing more than a glorified TODO list.  The advisory itself, and the associated bug report, are important... both of those are public.  We're not trying to hide any details... those details can be found in a dozen places: the public bugzilla advisory report, the official advisory on the website, the security-announce mailing list, the CVE dictionary, NVD, Secunia, Bugtrack (the website and the mailing list), the full-disclosure mailing list... the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fellow should have done a bit more research before starting in on his conspiracy theory.  It was both amusing and infuriating... amusing at his ignorance, infuriating that he would start the FUD train without even firing off a simple email saying "wtf guys, this bug is private?!?".  An easy explanation could have been given and the FUD train wouldn't have left the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's nice to see both Adam and Fabrice straighten this guy out in comments on his blog, and Fabrice made his own &lt;a href="http://www.linux-wizard.net/index.php?id_blog=161"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; regarding it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice said it quite well:  "So next time guys, get your facts ;)"&lt;/p&gt;

Novell laid off all the guys they hired when they aquired Immunix a few years ago, back in 2005.  I had noticed that my friend Seth had sent a message a while ago indicating that he has no longer with Novell and passing on a new email address and just chocked it up to him moving on.  But now I see this message from Crispin on the AppArmor development mailing list which pointed to &lt;a href="http://www.news.com/8301-13580_3-9796140-39.html"&gt;this CNET&lt;/a&gt; news piece describing what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like Novell wants the opensource community to pick up development of AppArmor (they must, they apparently let the entire team go).  Perhaps the success of OpenSUSE got to their heads and they're looking for cheap labour now?  At any rate, I find it rather ruthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I'm concerned about AppArmor...  I know SELinux is the star of the Fedora/Red Hat show, but AppArmor has a good showing in Mandriva 2008, forthcoming Ubuntu, and Annvix (amongst probably others).  Oh, and OpenSUSE/SLES itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also nice to see Crispin is still motivated to work on AppArmor and has built a consultancy company around it (and other security hardening technologies), &lt;a href="http://www.mercenarylinux.com/"&gt;Mercenary Linux&lt;/a&gt;.  Good for them, and I hope that turns out well for them and I also hope that Novell doesn't try farting around with AppArmor too much and wreck it even further (seems like Novell is doing quite a lot these days to piss on people...)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Synchronize computers with Unison</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/synchronize-computers-with-unison" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-09T09:30:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-09T09:30:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-10-09:/blog/synchronize-computers-with-unison</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechRepublic tip is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=115"&gt;Synchronize computers with Unison&lt;/a&gt; which introduces the multi-computer synchronization tool known as Unison.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva 2008 now available... and the work begins in earnest</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mandriva-2008-now-available-and-the-work-begins-in-earnest" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-09T09:26:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-09T09:26:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-10-09:/blog/mandriva-2008-now-available-and-the-work-begins-in-earnest</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I always like the week or two before a release.

While the other developers are busting their butts trying to get things finished for the upcoming release, I actually get to take a bit of a breather, largely because I don't like duplicating effort so any non-essential updates get to take a bit of a break until the next version comes out, so I can do an update once, instead of twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, once the release is out and the developers get to take a bit of a breather, my workload doubles (sometimes triples) because not only do I have to deal with those updates that had taken a break for a few days, but the inundation of bugfix requests really comes in.  It's no secret that the bulk of bugfix updates come out in the 2-3 weeks post-release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... welcome Mandriva 2008!  You're a very pretty beast (and now that you're out I get to play with you some more and see what you've got hiding up your sleeves (I don't have an opporunity or the time to fiddle with cooker too much)), and I'm sure I will be cursing you before the week is out.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cursing in a good way, of course (well, I hope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, congratulations to the development team on what looks to be a fantastic release (I've installed the RC's on two systems and despite some X quirks that I worked around (using my old xorg.conf), it looks pretty solid.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, they're married to Microsoft technology, and I doubt they even realize &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they are.  They're using an Active Directory-based authentication system and they keep having trouble with it...  new systems were donated to the school this year, and have are unable to login to the domain.... for no explainable reason.  File and print sharing works, but it's not seamless as it should be.  I poked around a bit on it, but know nothing about AD or how to manage it.  They're also using Microsoft Office, all the workstations are mix of anything from Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98, or something in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I've been reading a bit about about the increasing adoption of open source solutions in government and schools.  For instance, in Russia, &lt;a href="http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/indexEn.shtml?2007/09/14/266177"&gt;ALT Linux will be installed on every school system by 2009&lt;/a&gt;, replacing Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, the &lt;a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-Canadian-Labour-Congress-Switches-To-OpenOffice-65716.shtml"&gt;Canadian Labour Congress is switching from WordPerfect to OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt;, saving themselves about $60,000 in licensing fees (if they had switched to Microsoft Office).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also found that some of the technologies and methodologies used in the school are horribly ineffecient.  Things like using MSN for inter-office instant messaging.  Things like using Word documents to store little tidbits of info and placing them in shares for everyone to access.  Things that a good database with a groupware or wiki frontend would nicely handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'll setup (and donate) a server with a nice LAMP stack to provide some of this stuff... a jabber server for inter-office IM (no loss of service if their ISP goes down), a MediaWiki install, maybe phpGroupware or something similar.  Teachers have too little time as it is, and for it to be wasted doing inefficient and repetative tasks doesn't sit well with me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Obtaining file information with RPM</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/obtaining-file-information-with-rpm" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-09-18T08:38:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-09-18T08:38:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-09-18:/blog/obtaining-file-information-with-rpm</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today's tip over at TechRepublic is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=101"&gt;Obtaining file information with RPM&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;And to think that the possibility is quite distinct that one reason Linux adoption hasn't taken off is because when you tell people it's completely free, they just nod and say "that's nice" instead of thinking they can save hundreds of dollars... no cost for Windows, no cost for Office (using OpenOffice.org instead), even no cost for Photoshop using something like the GIMP instead.  No... they don't think that way because to them Windows, Office, and Photoshop are often just as free... easily downloaded pirated copies, cracks, or buddies with copies and valid licenses they just pass over.  So the bottom line is Windows doesn't cost them money, so they don't get excited about another OS that doesn't cost them money.  After all, chances are they're not paying for it now and if they need to upgrade, well... there's always bittorrent and friends with a copy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd encourage anyone with a few minutes to read the article.  It's lengthy, but wow is it an eye opener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Par for the course I guess.  However, I'm seriously considering taking the next two days off to recover some of my personal time that was spent doing this thing over the last 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's fast, it's clean... the old one had a fairly nasty sanitycheck output... in fact, it was so long it died before it completed, oddly enough.  At any rate, there are now a total of 3 errors, and 2 of those are "invalid email address" formats for the login name of 2 accounts.  In other words, bugzilla has nothing to complain about.  Of course, it took some very heavy (manual) SQL manipulation to correct most of those errors.  But it's done now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is a new maintainers database; right now it's using the old one which is pretty... well.. fugly.  A new one will need to be done, but that involves writing it completely from scratch, with backend scripts and whatnot as well.  Anne hasn't asked me to do it (yet), so we'll leave things well enough alone until she does or someone else gets assigned to it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="bugzilla"></category></entry><entry><title>Bugzilla and maintainer groups</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/bugzilla-and-maintainer-groups" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-30T21:19:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-06-30T21:19:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-06-30:/blog/bugzilla-and-maintainer-groups</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The bugzilla conversion is almost complete, except for a few minor issues that need to be figured out (such as who will be owning the bugs initiall when they are submitted).

And a few minor cosmetics.  Head on over to &lt;a href="http://bugzilla.linsec.ca/"&gt;bugzilla.linsec.ca&lt;/a&gt; and check it out.  Constructive feedback is welcome and encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the only thing left to do is handle components in a sane fashion (and fix a bugzilla bug that doesn't respect group memberships for QA contact).  The below is a posting to cooker regarding how I think ownership and maintainership of packages should be handled.  Not everyone will agree with me, but I think it would work out pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion on package maintainership, is that it does not make
much
sense for us, except possibly for very important packages. For Debian,
package maintainership makes sense, because most packagers actually
package
what they regularly use, and because they have an acceptable
source-packages/maintainers ratio. It is usual for Debian maintainers to
step down from maintenance when they stop being users of a package. In
Mandriva, we have many packages which are just packaged for users, not the
packager, convenience, and so the packager may not really know or care a
lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  The problem here is that people package stuff they don't use.
Which is ok, to the extent that we package a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of stuff, and some
things one fellow might use more than another, or it's just being
packaged for the sake of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintainer groups would solve this (to some extent).  For instance,
since I mostly care about security/server stuff, it would be logical for
me to be part of the Networking and Security groups.  Do I want to
actually &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt; anything?  No.  I don't have enough time to be the
maintainer for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, having said that, would I like to see the bugs posted to those
components?  Yes.  Do I want to see the bugs for KDE?  No, I don't use
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have two issues here... I can't possibly filter bugs based on what
I use/like in the current scenario.  My procmail filter would be crazy
trying to filter out everything except bugs on php, apache, openssh,
xchat, whatever.  So I either get everything, or I get nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; potentially fix (or have already fixed) an issue in,
say, openssh, I'd like to at least see bugs that get assigned to it.  Or
perhaps I'm more knowledgeable than the average person.  In this way, I
can be a part of the Networking maintainer group, see those bugs, and
can jump in and fix/re-assign to me the bugs that I know I can fix
quickly (or invalidate them if they're bogus).  This doesn't mean I all
of a sudden &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt; openssh, but that I'm aware of what is happening
to it, by proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could actually further be extended to the point of not having one
big bug mailing list.  We could do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) cooker ml
2) maintainer groups ml (kde_team@, gnome_team@, security_team@, etc.)
and people who want to be a part of those groups either subscribe to
those lists or otherwise get added (Andreas had thought about using LDAP
to create impromptu mailing lists for teams, so that's a possibility
too)
2a) bugs reported to the Networking group have a QA contact of
network_team@ instead of cooker@ or bugs@; this makes the &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt; the QA
contact instead of a) one big ml or b) an individual who 1) may not
care, 2) be too busy, 3) no longer is involved, or 4) is on holidays;
essentially bugs get &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; coverage this way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drawback here is that these groups/teams would need to be defined
and setup.  The logical start to the creation of these teams would be to
have them correspond with components (KDE, GNOME, X.org, Printing,
etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone is unsure about how/what to do something in a package, he may
well have better luck just looking up and asking the top entries in
changelog, or asking cooker@, than asking a maintainer who just packaged
something and forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly.  Or, with maintainer groups/teams, asking the members of the
team (i.e. the networking_team@ alias/ml could be consulted rather than
a maintainer or cooker in general).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people will argue that maybe this will make cooker@ less useful,
but I disagree.  Discussion can certainly take place on cooker@, and
should.  But maintainer teams can facilitate the entire packaging
process by making more people able to fix/change/update packages even
though they aren't "the maintainer".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, aren't we all in favour of (and haven't we been doing, in
fact) the removal of per-user ACLs for most packages in the buildsystem?
For what reason do we do this?  To allow more people to work on packages
(except for some "core" packages, of course).  Moving to a team-based
model facilitates this even further, and doesn't &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; the usefulness
of current cooker@; there are many people on the list who aren't
maintainers and thus discussion should still be done here.  But an
internal ml/alias for a team facilitates discussion of things pertaining
to the team ((re-)assignment of packages, figuring who will claim a bug,
etc.) that the average cooker probably doesn't care about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="bugzilla"></category></entry><entry><title>New bugzilla in the works</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/new-bugzilla-in-the-works" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-28T22:21:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-06-28T22:21:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-06-28:/blog/new-bugzilla-in-the-works</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, someone else was supposed to be working on the new bugzilla, but they got pulled off for an OEM project (completely understandable), so since I really need some functionality and speed out of bugzilla to progress with some work flows I have in mind, I decided to hunker down …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, someone else was supposed to be working on the new bugzilla, but they got pulled off for an OEM project (completely understandable), so since I really need some functionality and speed out of bugzilla to progress with some work flows I have in mind, I decided to hunker down and do the dang thing myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters you can take a peek at the current implementation here: &lt;a href="http://bugzilla.linsec.ca/"&gt;bugzilla.linsec.ca&lt;/a&gt;.  A good sample bug to really take a peek at might be bug #26975.  Or, well heck, any bug you like really.  Existing logins for the current Mandriva bugzilla do work on this new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to dig around in the database schema and data and convert a dataset I had obtained about a month ago.  The script to convert it is a fairly nice (but hackish) piece of work, which was difficult due to the idea of moving from package-based components to "group"-based components; instead of filing a bug against x11-server-some-video-driver you would file it against X.org.  With an optional "RPM Package" field to include the exact rpm package if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script works well and interacts with two databases (old and new) to retrieve values from each and writes it out to a plain-text SQL file.  It takes about 30s for it to convert 30600+ bugs, which isn't bad since it's doing a tonne of regexp magic to figure out what package (libfoo) goes to what new Component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products and Versions are also handled different (better)... the version is now the distro version, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the package version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it's &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.  Of course, that's what happens when you trim the database fat.  The old bugzilla database is about 5.2GB of data.  The new one is about 500MB.  Makes a huge difference in speed, plus looking up bugs, submitting bugs (yaa!  a single page to enter a new bug!) and so on is much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this needed to be done a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and sorry to the folks at Red Hat... I used their layout/style and tried to emulate it (their bugzilla looks very clean) and I think I did a fairly decent job of it.  It looks quite a bit different from our current bugzilla, but I think it turned out pretty good (a few things aside).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still a few things need to be done.  Hopefully next week we can actually implement this thing live.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="bugzilla"></category></entry><entry><title>The perfect desktop: Mandriva 2007.1</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/the-perfect-desktop-mandriva-20071" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-02T15:03:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-06-02T15:03:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-06-02:/blog/the-perfect-desktop-mandriva-20071</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Came across this good HOWTO on HowtoForge entitled &lt;a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/the_perfect_desktop_mandriva_2007_spring_free"&gt;The Perfect Desktop: Mandriva 2007 Spring Free (Mandriva 2007.1)&lt;/a&gt;.

There's some tutorials out there, but they're all pretty terse... most of the stuff it's almost assumed that you already know.  Anyways, used the church I go to since I have access to one of the servers there and set it up as an OpenVPN server with the appropriate forwarding via the firewall (a linksys "box").  Then set my firewall for my LAN as the OpenVPN client.  Connection established, works great.  Can ping the server from the client; however despite following some tutorials with shorewall/OpenVPN integration, I could only get the firewall itself to ping the remote server.  None of the clients systems would (which makes it a little silly since the idea is to have always-on access from any machine on my network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, installed this software called &lt;a href="http://tunnelblick.net/"&gt;Tunnelblick&lt;/a&gt; for OS X to stick on my laptop and see if I could get one client to talk.  Works well enough, but Tunnelblick comes with absolutely no documentation.  It's a free GUI to OpenVPN so I suppose I shouldn't complain too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I could mount a samba share on my laptop from the server in the church.  Mission accomplished, for the most part (although trying to get any of these guys at the church to setup Tunnelblick would probably result in my getting kicked out of the church).  One thing I had wanted to do was to access the firewall's web interface, but was unable to... for some reason I can ping the server, but not the firewall.  Maybe the VPN connection makes the connection between the two machines only, instead of allowing me to access any resource from here (useful for samba, I guess, but at that point I'd rather just use SFTP and drop OpenVPN altogether since the idea is to allow remote access of files for the staff).  However, I did follow a tutorial on making one LAN access another LAN... not sure why it's not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, then I whipped out my absolute favourite tool to solve the job... a quick ssh tunnel and I was able to access the remote firewall's web interface from the inside.  Gotta love ssh port forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully tomorrow I can get the whole LAN&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;LAN thing working.  Need to find some different (better?) tutorials I guess.

&lt;p&gt;My first impressions are this:  the boot was extremely quiet.  That's ok, but I wasn't sure what was happening at first.  Then I get in, start poking around a bit, and decide to run their update utility.  Says I have to run "apt-get install -f".  That's a clear sign something is borked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, apt wants to remove all of GNOME.  So I let it (it's a vmware image, after all... no harm there).  Ok, so now my install is ok, but I'm in GNOME in a gnome-terminal, and apparently all these programs are gone and I'd kinda like to have them back.  Do you think apt tells me where the problem is?  Nope.  It keeps telling me about unmet dependencies until my "apt-get install gnome-core ..." line is getting ridiculously long as I keep adding new packages.  And then &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; it tells me what's wrong.  Apparently "libsoup2.2-8" is not available.  It could have told me that right at the beginning.  And people think RPM has dependency hell?  Ummm... ok... this is apt, using (from what I can tell) deb packages, and clearly it has issues too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the appeal of Nexenta is...  hmmm... I'm not really sure.  It's running GNOME.  It's brown.  Looks an awful lot like Ubuntu.  It's not using all GNU tools.  Heck, it's not even using BSD tools.  I mean, really, "ps ax" works on my mac and on my linux boxen.  Does it work here?  Nope.  Gives me usage.  The man page lies too.  Oh, it talks all nice and sweet about using -a and -x, but there is no -x, and -a doesn't give me all my processes, it gives me one process (and probably the most useless at that)... ps itself.  How cool is that?  So if you want to know how long it took to run your ps command, and what it's pid was, use "ps -a".  The closest thing to "ps ax" that I can see is "ps -e".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses GRUB.  That's kinda neat.  No idea where the kernel is hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these aren't really comments against Nexenta, OpenSolaris, or Solaris/SunOS themselves... it's largely my own ignorance, but why are they calling themselves "GNU/OpenSolaris" and not using better GNU tools?  I mean, OS X uses the BSD ps and it's more feature-rich than the SunOS ps.  Nevermind the Linux ps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Again, I'm just ignorant of anything other than *BSD or Linux.  It was interesting, and maybe I'll try again once someone has a libsoup2.2-8 package for apt to install (not too keen on just plain old not having GNOME around anymore because then it would make for some fairly boring playing around).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Bugzilla and email</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/bugzilla-and-email" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-24T23:31:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-05-24T23:31:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-05-24:/blog/bugzilla-and-email</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had asked on IRC the other day for info on how to send emails to bugzilla.

Just for kicks I tried something with shorewall that actually worked quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In shorewall, you can write a rule like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNAT    net             loc:10.0.5.10   tcp     http    -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which takes an incoming http connection to the firewall and forwards it to the appropriate IP (10.0.5.10 in this case) in the "loc" (local) zone.  So I tried the same thing except the IP wasn't an external machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, eth0 is connected to the internet and gets a dynamic IP via DHCP.  eth1 is connected to my internal network, similar to the firewall.  It also runs shorewall.  So I made eth1:0 an IP on the local network (say, 10.0.5.100).  Then I have a rule that does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes the http traffic coming in from the network on port 80 and redirects it to port 10.0.5.100 (or incoming port 80 on eth0 to eth1:0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works like a champ!  This way I can configure apache to use &lt;VirtualHost 10.0.5.100:80&gt;, and never need to change anything if the external IP changes because it only listens on that IP, and shorewall will take care of the forwarding (and it doesn't care what the IP on eth0 is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure someone has come up with this before, but I was goofing around and came up with this and it worked so figured I'd share as this is much easier to manage than using wildcard addressing, particularly if you want to use https in there as well (anyone who was connecting earlier tonight probably got an XML download instead of a web page, and for that you have my apologies).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>VMware Workstation 6 and Sound in Mandriva</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/vmware-workstation-6-and-sound-in-mandriva" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-10T14:52:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-05-10T14:52:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-05-10:/blog/vmware-workstation-6-and-sound-in-mandriva</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I keep running into this issue everytime I have to run vmware tools so I thought I'd mention it here.  vmware-tools insists on rewriting /etc/modprobe.conf and changing "alias sound-slot-0 snd-ens1371" to "alias sound es1371".&lt;/p&gt;

I've finished rqp, the counter-part to rqs.  rqp imports the requires, provides, and file lists of binary rpm packages into a postgresql (or mysql, or sqlite (although I've only tested with postgresql so far)) database and queries the same data.  rqp resembles urpmf/urpmq in functionality although it's not quite as feature-rich.  But if all you do is query for which packages contain what file, or what package provides or what package requires that, rqp works great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting tidbits:  it took rqp 22 minutes to import the rpms of 2007.1/x86_64, which is 5490 packages or 5.6GB of packages.  The database contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Tag Records : 11              Package Records : 32828          
File Records: 4245034         Requires Records: 434693         
                              Provides Records: 154859
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially it has the data for the currently supported 11 distributions (MNF2, CD3, CD3/x86_64, CS3, CS3/x86_64, CS4, CS4/x86_64, 2007, 2007/x86_64, 2007.1, and 2007.1/x86_64).  That's a lot of data.  In contrast, the database for rqs contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Tag Records : 4               Package Records: 7791           
File Records: 4226875         Source Records : 40233 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely because rqp needs to distinguish between architecture and Corp3 (which is 4 "binary products" comes from one pool of source rpms).  Anyways, I benchmarked rqp versus urpmf, and this is where it gets really interesting.  urpmf was run on a 2007.1/x86 system (and keep in mind, urpmf &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; knows about 2007.1/x86).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[qateam@mercury ~]$ time urpmf whois | wc -l
5.04user 0.33system 0:03.99elapsed 134%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+17476minor)pagefaults 0swaps
34
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So urpmf found 34 matches in 3.99s.  The same with rqp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
vdanen@artemis:~/ &gt;% time ./rqp -q whois -C
rqp $Id: rqp 183 2007-05-05 18:35:24Z vdanen $

187 matche(s) in database for substring (whois)
./rqp -q whois -C  0.04s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 9.796 total
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoah!  rqp found 187 matches across 11 distributions in pretty much the exact same time.  urpmf is written in perl access a single file (although, to be fair, I believe urpmf has to uncompress the hdlist.cz first before reading it).  rqp is written in php and access a postgresql database over TCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, I'm impressed with rqp's speed; I thought urpmf would beat it hands down.  I haven't done any urpmq runs to look up provides/requires although I imagine the time difference between the two would be about the same.  Of course, urpmf/urpmq are more handy because you don't need to import anything or setup a database, etc.  rqp is vastly superior for what I need though, as this way I no longer have to jump into a chroot (or various chroots) to run urpmf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, rqp (and rqs) have to do things like establish database connections, read and parse a small configuration file, and other things that urpmf never needs to do.  Still need s some more work clean things up, but so far I'm pleased with the basic functionality.  2+ days well-spent in coding this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people look at me funny when I tell them I wrote CLI programs in PHP.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>New rpm query tool</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/new-rpm-query-tool" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-03T18:46:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-05-03T18:46:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-05-03:/blog/new-rpm-query-tool</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just spent most of the day and quite a bit of yesterday porting a program Stew wrote for the secteam (called srpm) that builds a database of src.rpm files so you can do queries on source files (this is extremely useful for us in determining whether or not a …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just spent most of the day and quite a bit of yesterday porting a program Stew wrote for the secteam (called srpm) that builds a database of src.rpm files so you can do queries on source files (this is extremely useful for us in determining whether or not a vulnerable source file exists in any supported distros).  For example, if there was a vulnerability in foo.c, we could do "srpm -q foo.c" to see if that source file exists anywhere; this helped us find a bunch of PDF-related programs that were vulnerable to issues in xpdf.  An invaluable tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with it was it was using sqlite, which is fine, but I've been thinking about a web frontend to it and wanted to make it more general (and due to PHP's sqlite module, I'd need both it and sqlite2 installed on Annvix).  So I took the liberty of rewriting parts of it and also making it use the PEAR MDB2 functionality to make it portable.  Right now I've got it working with a PostgreSQL database, which is kinda nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about the database abstraction stuff is that it doesn't seem to be slowing things down too much.  With srpm (which uses straight php sqlite functions), I get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ time srpm -q libgen.h -C
39 matche(s) in database for substring (libgen.h)
3.31user 0.60system 0:04.15elapsed 94%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same query with rqs results in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% time ./rqs -q libgen.h -C 
rqs $Id: rqs 175 2007-05-04 03:30:24Z vdanen $
39 matche(s) in database for substring (libgen.h)
./rqs -q libgen.h -C  0.05s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 15.651 total
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So about a 1s increase using database abstraction and postgresql vs using straight php sqlite functions and an sqlite database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two databases are the same, in that they have data for CS3, CS4, 2007, and 2007.1.  According to rqs, this provides the following records:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 $Id: rqs 173 2007-05-03 18:58:34Z vdanen $

Database statistics:

Tag Records : 4               Package Records: 7791           
File Records: 4226875         Source Records : 40233 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really interesting thing is importing.  Stew told me that srpm took quite a bit to import data, but I didn't realize how slow it was (I've never used srpm to import anything before).  To normalize the database I had to import the 2007.1 sources (and remove the 2006 sources from it).  The resulting import of 4.5GB of src.rpm files via srpm was 4:33:52 (yes, 4.5hrs).  With rqs, the import of the same src.rpm directory took 52:05, so just under an hour.  Scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now the next step is to write rqs' counterpart (rqp) which will do the same thing rqs does for src.rpms with binary rpms.  And then the web frontend to it as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>New mutt 1.5.15 has a very nice new feature!</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/new-mutt-1515-has-a-very-nice-new-feature" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-04-30T10:18:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-04-30T10:18:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-04-30:/blog/new-mutt-1515-has-a-very-nice-new-feature</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just found today when I was looking to see if I missed something with the mutt sidebar patch (still irritates me that I have to sync a mailbox &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; jumping to another mailbox in order for the counts in the sidebar to be updated properly), that mutt 1.5.15 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just found today when I was looking to see if I missed something with the mutt sidebar patch (still irritates me that I have to sync a mailbox &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; jumping to another mailbox in order for the counts in the sidebar to be updated properly), that mutt 1.5.15 was released earlier this month.  This is an extremely worthwhile upgrade, especially because it now has SMTP support built-in.  It's about time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more having to use exim or postfix to relay the mail, you can now send the mail out directly from mutt itself which makes things a whole lot nicer.  The &lt;a href="http://www.mutt.org/doc/devel/manual.html#smtp-url"&gt;relevant section of the documentation&lt;/a&gt; covers it a little bit more, but I've just tested it out and it works great (you will want to compile it using --enable-smtp and --with-sasl).  Works wonderfully with non-authenticated SMTP (good for using your ISP's mail server) and also works with authenticated SMTP (tried with my server which uses CRAM-MD5), and also supports using an email address as a login (i.e you could use "set smtp_url="smtp://joe@user.com:password@smtp.myhost.com" and it works properly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, kudos to the mutt team for getting this in place!  I'll have to update my wiki to cover this as it largely makes irrelevant the sections I have in there configuring postfix and exim to relay mail (which you can still do if you like).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva 2007.1 on HP TX1120 tablet</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mandriva-20071-on-hp-tx1120-tablet" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-04-26T17:20:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-04-26T17:20:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-04-26:/blog/mandriva-20071-on-hp-tx1120-tablet</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I had the opportunity to install 2007.1 on a HP TX1120 laptop (a tablet).

This is a really slick laptop; it's an AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-56 (1.8GHz), with 2GB RAM, a Seagate 160GB HDD, NVIDIA GeForce Go 6150 (ok, the graphics card leaves a little to be desired as it's a 64MB card that can use shared memory (up to 512MB I think)), DVD DL writer, synaptics touchpad, a Broadcom ("Dell Wireless 1390 WLAN Mini-PCI) 802.11b/g card, NVIDIA nForce gigabit ethernet, Realtek High Def audio card, and the touchscreen itself (an eGalaxy thing).  Came pre-installed with Vista Home Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: Vista is awful!  Ick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second: Mandriva 2007.1 installs and runs really nice on this, with a few caveats.  I used the 32bit version (tried the 64bit one as well, it seems to work no worse than the 32bit although the throughput from the wireless card seems lower), and the wireless card works with ndiswrapper.  Sound doesn't work (yet, I've done some reading and it seems like this card isn't really liked).  The bcm43xx driver does not work (no choice but to use ndiswrapper).  The graphics display was properly detected and configured.  Putting the thing to sleep (hibernation, suspend?  no idea what to call it, I pushed a button by accident and it went to sleep and wouldn't properly resume).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The touchscreen doesn't seem to work at all.  Not sure if I'm missing something, but MCC doesn't seem to offer anything to configure it, there's nothing special noted in the xorg.conf file, and the reading I've done that pointed to a callibration tool and a driver have done nothing for me yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it's a really nice laptop.  Might have to get myself one of these; my Toshiba Libretto is being under-used because my fingers are too fat to work on the keyboard properly.  But this guy is pretty small (smaller than my macbook), although the glossy back makes fingerprints really stick out and the screen itself is really amusing to look at after my daughter does some writing on it (in Vista, unfortunately).  Haven't tried the SD card reader yet to see if that works, but as it stands now, it's very very usable (although sound and the tablet itself working would be a really nice bonus.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva on CIA</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mandriva-on-cia" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-04-19T13:12:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-04-19T13:12:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-04-19:/blog/mandriva-on-cia</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just setup a CIA.vc account for Mandriva which is available here: &lt;a href="http://cia-vc.org/stats/project/Mandriva"&gt;http://cia-vc.org/stats/project/Mandriva&lt;/a&gt;.

Since I mirror cooker, I figured I'd do a straight "urpmi --auto-select" upgrade on my 2007 box rather than downloading a bunch of ISOs.  So it's not really RC1 (really, with a few hundred packages being changed since the RC was cut, I think calling it a beta might be better but whatever), but it's cooker current as of 10:00am my time (did a quick rsync to make sure I had the latest of everything).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a GNOME user when I'm using Linux, so I was logged into GNOME when I fired up gnome-terminal, did a "urpmi.removemedia -a" then added the main/release and contribs/release media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the install went well.  930 packages, 1861MB, and 42 minutes later, the system was upgraded.  urpmi told me it was going to remove libpython2.4-devel (due to unsatisfied python == 2.4.3), didn't want to upgrade suspend-scripts due to missing wltool, and was going to remove libguile12 due to an unsatisfied guile == 1.6.8.  Fine, no worries although python could concern some people (don't worry, this is because python 2.5 is being installed, so you get libpython2.5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the install failed at package 928 of 930 due to libiso9660_5 being missing (either not on the mirrors or has been replaced and the hdlists hadn't been upgraded).  No worries.  Doing another "urpmi --auto-select" afterwards installed another 4 packages... wierd... by my count there should have been 1 package left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the wierdness begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for one, 2007.0 updates have kernel 2.6.17.12mdv.  But 2007.1 only has 2.6.17.11mdv.  Huh?  Someone should fix that pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade didn't install x11-driver-input-evdev, which was one of two errors preventing X from starting.  The second was a X version mismatch on the fglrx driver.  I believe I had installed the proprietary ATI drivers with ATI's package way back when.. been a while so I don't really remember.  Anyways, I added the non-free/release media and installed dkms-ati.  Still didn't work.  After using urpmf, I determined I needed to install the ati package as well (why this isn't a requirement of dkms-ati I have no idea).  Once that was done, X would start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hostname got removed.  My machine has the cool name of "cerberus"... imagine my dismay when it had the (ultimately boring) name of "localhost".  Ugh.  A trip to the Mandriva Control Center fixed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect urpmi removed xscreensaver and didn't tell me.  Why?  Well, I had screensavers before, and I also had the screen lock after 10 minutes.  I had to urpmi xscreensaver.  Screensavers are back.  xlockmore is already installed.  Screen still doesn't lock.  When I tell GNOME to lock the screen it does a whole lot of nothing.  Doesn't even kick in the screensaver.  Too bad, because I wanted to watch Bob burn (Xflame).  And the "power management" button in the screensaver preferences does nothing.  I should have checked after I'd been away from the machine for a few hours whether or not the monitor got turned off.  Heck, the screensaver preview doesn't work either.  Something is broken here I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't played too much more with it to poke around with other stuff.  vmware server works, so I'm happy... the rest doesn't much matter provided that a) zsh works, b) gnome-terminal works, and c) vmware-server works.  Beyond that, I don't much care (although a non-working screensaver is a little irritating... so is the fact that the session doesn't lock).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNOME doesn't look any different.  I can't really determine quickly what's different about it.  KDE looks ok; I can tell it's changed.  Nothing overly exciting there, but KDE doesn't do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to see if I could make Metisse work.  I got it enabled, then tried to log in with GNOME and it just sat there.  CTRL-ALT-BKSPACE'd out of that, tried KDE and now I have 9 virtual desktops.  Ok...  I can switch them, but I didn't see any of the fancy transitions that I noticed in the demos.  I suppose there's more to be done to configure it, but nothing in MCC or the menus jumped out at me as a "Metisse configuration tool".  Maybe there isn't one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the upgrade went pretty smooth.  All things considered, I think this is the best verison upgrade I've done yet (normally I do a wipe and reinstall).

&lt;p&gt;This issue was noticed when I set up the mock Mandriva wiki a few months ago and I could never figure out where the problem was coming from (the server is at a co-location, behind two different OpenBSD firewalls with three switches in the closet.. nevermind all the junk in front of that).  Well, today it got figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out the issue was with an OpenBSD firewall and the interface packets to my machine were being sent through was on a gigabit intel pro card.  Now, I don't know if the problem is with the card itself or with OpenBSD's drivers for it, but after a whole lot of trouble-shooting and shuffling things around, we finally put the network my machine is on via a different interface in the OpenBSD firewall, rebooted it, and all of a sudden all of the problems disappeared.  I've noticed that as more people upgrade to distros shipping this new kernel, more issues were showing up... not only could regular desktop users not connect to my sites, but some sites delivering mail would timeout, etc.  I'm suspecting this is due to upgrades of kernels on those machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this is all fixed now.  For the first time in I don't know how long, I can visit my websites via my Mandriva desktop.  Wow, is it nice to have that again!  So... welcome back all you 2.6.17+ using people!  It's a nuisance that the kernel developers knew about this issue and didn't care to do anything about it.  Sure, the problem isn't technically with the linux kernel, but when you go from 2.6.16 (which worked fine) to 2.6.17 (which didn't) and they're aware of it and poo-poo the situation, well... that's not fun for anyone (it's not like I, and many others like me, can go and tell people to change the TCP window scaling value on their desktop machine for anyone who wants to visit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well... the nuisance, for me at least, is dealt with.  And I'm very glad of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Yet Another Secure Linux Distro.. why?</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/yet-another-secure-linux-distro-why" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-02-17T09:53:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-02-17T09:53:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-02-17:/blog/yet-another-secure-linux-distro-why</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On IRC last night I was pointed to a new secure linux distro... this one simply called &lt;a href="http://hardenedlinux.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Hardened Linux&lt;/a&gt;.

The individual whom I was speaking with ("Intensity") was wondering why there needed to be YASLD (Yet Another Secure Linux Distro).  Interested, I was reading through the page to see if there was anything unique... you know, something no other secure distro offered that might give it some appeal.  Well, about the only thing I can see that would make this thing any more interesting than any others is that this one is based on Slackware.  AFAIK, there is no other hardened distro out there based on Slackware.  They also seem to be working on some custom configuration (web-based) tools.  Well, that seems par for the course, doesn't it?  I mean, most distros have some means of configuration other than commandline (well, except maybe Annvix!).  Anyways, it looks like, judging by the age of web pages and forums setup on sourceforge that this started around October 2006.  Now the question is why?  There are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; hardened Linux distros out there... this one has four developers, very little in the way of well-setup infrastructure (no mailing list archives, for instance).  Now, I'm not saying this to discourage the Hardened Linux developers... they are certainly entitled to create their own distro, but having worked on my own for almost 4 years now, I have to wonder about the rationale behind it.  It's not easy having your own distro, and it really isn't easy for something as "niche" as this.  And looking at their &lt;a href="http://hardenedlinux.sourceforge.net/?sub=features"&gt;features page&lt;/a&gt; there's nothing that jumps out at me to make me go "YES!  &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the secure distro I need to be using!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me re-iterate.  There are a lot of secure distros out there:  Annvix, Openwall GNU/Linux, Trustix, EnGarde, Devil-Linux, OpenNA Linux, Adamantix, Phayoune Linux, IPCop Firewall, Hardened Linux From Scratch, ALT Linux, and probably a whole lot more that I can't think of right now (or that aren't showing up in a quick google of distrowatch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think for a hardened distro (especially for something as niche/specific as server/firewall/etc.-only needs to have some really good features to make it stand out from the crowd.  Otherwise I think the developer(s) interested in starting a new distro would be better off looking for a distro with similar ideas and goals and contribute/develop for it.  No, maybe "good" features is wrong.  It needs to have unique and compelling features... something to make it stand out from the crowd.  And looking at Hardened Linux I don't see anything compelling or unique there.  Of course, the same could be said about a whole bunch of distros out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just makes me wonder what the rationale is if you can get everything you're offering in another similar distro.  To go through all that effort and time to end up with a product that is 95% identical to another product just seems wierd to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Sidebar for mutt</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/sidebar-for-mutt" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-02-15T15:01:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-02-15T15:01:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2007-02-15:/blog/sidebar-for-mutt</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Found this really nice patch for mutt today, it's a &lt;a href="http://www.lunar-linux.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44"&gt;sidebar patch&lt;/a&gt; that adds a list of mailboxes to your mutt view so you can see which mailboxes has new mail in it, the current count of messages in each, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to googlebot and the load it was generating on my server at the colo, I had to move svn.annvix.org from my primary webserver to a spare box on my cable line at home.  The problem was if I referred to http://svn.annvix.org/ from home, I was never able to connect to it (browser would return unable to connect), so I figured I needed a way to tell shorewall to redirect anything coming from the local LAN to the firewall to be redirected back through the firewall to the specified machine on the local LAN again.  Sounds like it should be pretty straightforward but it wasn't until I found this entry in the shorewall FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;

I've been running mutt under screen for a few weeks now (and irssi) which has been working fine but it wasn't until today that I put two and two together, namely that when I cut-n-paste from a terminal with mutt in it, I was getting a lot of whitespace tacked on to the end.  This was a big pain for cut-n-paste, say, CVE entries that needed to go into a wiki; all that extra whitespace got tacked on.  Well, I stumbled on the fact that if I run mutt outside of screen, this doesn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've spent the last hour googling and trying to find out how to correct this.  I suppose it's due to screen running as a vt100 terminal, but I can't figure out a way to tweak it or tell screen to behave, other than to use the "-O" option.  If I use "screen -O" then it works fine, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; I loose all the color settings in mutt (ie. title bar, status bar, highlight lines that go to the end of the screen).  With -O, my top bar is missing, my bottom bar is incomplete, and my highlight lines only highlight the actual text on the line, not to the end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaargh!  Essentially, I'm half-way there, but I can't stand such an ugly looking mutt using it that way.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?  Right now I'm not going to run mutt under screen, and I'm aliasing "screen" to "screen -O" because that'll prevent me be logged into another system and cut-n-paste from one term to another with a bunch of extra whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm... some more playing, now this is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I use "screen -S mutt -t mutt -O" then at the shell open mutt, then the cut-n-paste works properly, but mutt is ugly and I miss my status lines, etc.  But if I use "screen -S mutt -t mutt -O /sw/bin/mutt" (so it executes mutt directly) then mutt looks fantastic, but cut-n-paste adds all the extra white space.  Maybe there's some bad mojo with mutt and screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to google some more I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; well, that was quick.  Once I figured out where the issue was coming from, it's definitely a mutt/screen interaction issue and I found the answer in the &lt;a href="http://wiki.mutt.org/?MuttFaq/Appearance"&gt;mutt FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.  The fix is to add this to ~/.screenrc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
defbce on
term screen-bce&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can run mutt in screen, have it look good, and eliminate the whitespace.  wOOp!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Two Weeks of Wiki Hell</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/two-weeks-of-wiki-hell" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-12-07T02:05:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-12-07T02:05:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-12-07:/blog/two-weeks-of-wiki-hell</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I understand I volunteered for the job (it's a dirty job and I think very few people would want to do it) but boy am I glad it's done.

I've just spent nearly two weeks converting content from the Mandriva development wiki (http://qa.mandriva.com/twiki/bin/view/Main) in TWiki to the new MediaWiki setup at http://mdv.vmlinuz.ca/.  That will not be the final home for the new wiki, of course... currently we're waiting on IS Team to get MediaWiki setup and integrated with the authentication system used with the other Mandriva sites.  I'm told it should probably be up and ready next week at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those of you who work on the development wiki, please do your work on the new site instead.  I've asked Warly to make the old one read-only to keep the content available in case I've missed anything, but to prevent people from editing what's already been imported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a combination of a &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/files/twiki-convert.pl"&gt;perl script&lt;/a&gt; that Thierry wrote to do the bulk of the dirty work and a &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/files/TWiki_to_MediaWiki_Converter"&gt;BBEdit Text Factory&lt;/a&gt; as well (I wrote the latter based on the former after about a week since the perl script relied on a Mandriva perl module and I didn't feel like installing that on OS X).  I've made both the script and the Text Factory available for download for others to other use or just peek at.  The problem with these scripts is they're not the be-all and end-all, especially on a site with many different contributors... everyone seems to have their own style and syntax and boy does that make conversion interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from proofing, spell-checking, and styling, the wiki is pretty much done.  As it stands, it looks much better than the TWiki did and the performance seems much better as well.  Of course, once the proofing and spelling and everything else is done, it will look absolutely killer.  We have a lot of content (379 pages to be approximate (well, according to MediaWiki's stats)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, enjoy the new wiki.  I know I sure like it better.  But I must admit... I've lost pretty much all interest in even looking at a wiki for a while... kinda like when you've eaten pizza for two weeks and don't want to eat it again for the better part of a year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva wiki in the works</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mandriva-wiki-in-the-works" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-11-25T20:29:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-25T20:29:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-11-25:/blog/mandriva-wiki-in-the-works</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've decided that since it's been over a month now and no one has decided yet on what software to use (apparently there's one hold-out for xwiki while everyone else wants mediawiki... hello...

Let's see how the numbskulls at Distrowatch twisted things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
You wouldn't expect something like this to happen at any time, let alone on the eve of Mandriva Linux 2007 release. Last week, two Mandriva developers went on record saying that "Linux is not ready for the desktop". In a web log post entitled Why I'll never use Linux for my main desktop, Vincent Danen concluded: "This kind of thing is precisely why, for me, Linux belongs on the server. Now if those kernel-developing idiots would get their act together and give us a 2.6 kernel that was a) stable and b) supported for more than a week, then I'd really be pleased." Another Mandriva developer, Fabrice Facorat, agreed. In a post called Linux ready for Desktop? Of course not!, he had this to say: "For me when you have control over the environment and the hardware, Linux is ready: think servers, workstations, thin clients, kiosks. However when you have no control on the hardware, Linux is not ready because it somewhat lacks flexibility."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it, right from the horse's mouth! From two guys who have been working for a Linux company, developing a popular desktop Linux distribution, for years! Yes, that's right, Mandriva Linux is not ready for your desktop! Don't waste your money buying it!
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How sensationalistic is that?  For one, their facts are wrong.  Fabrice doesn't work for Mandriva; he's a volunteer (and a fantastic one at that; I value Fabrice's opinion like few others).  I am the only Mandriva employee here.  Did I say "Mandriva Linux is not ready for your desktop"?  No.  Did I say not to buy it?  No.  How they interpretted my blog post to come up with this is beyond me.  I can see some simple-minded idiot giggling with glee and rubbing his hands as he read, then completely &lt;i&gt;missed&lt;/i&gt; the context of my entry.  Yup, visualization is fantastic.  That's an image I'll carry with me for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
One really has to wonder about the future of a company which happily asks Gaël Duval to leave, yet is quite pleased to keep developers who publicly hint that they consider Linus Torvalds, Alan Cox and other kernel developers "idiots"! A perfect pre-release PR, non?
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-release PR?  I didn't know I was the official voice of Mandriva.  Actually, I don't think I've &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; been anything close to an official voice, much less a PR-spinning individual.  So to call this a PR is... well... beyond stupid.  To hint that Linus Torvalds, Alan Cox, and the other kernel developers are idiots?  Yes, well, I'm entitled to my opinion, &lt;i&gt;non?&lt;/i&gt; (i love that little french spin there).  And yes, I don't retract that opinion, which I can qualify in a moment (I should have qualified it before, sorry, but this is not a new opinion of mine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain things a bit further.  Distrowatch, while I appreciate the things they're trying to do, really need to get their heads out of their collective anti-Mandriva asses and actually &lt;i&gt;read&lt;/i&gt; what people write.  Since they are patently incapable of doing so, I'll reiterate my previous blog post here... or at least the relative parts because it seems to be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For instance, there's all this talk about the 3D Desktop stuff in Mandriva. Well, I like eye candy so I want to check it out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the reason why I was messing with this anyways.  Why did I chose Mandriva?  Well, come on, it's the distro I've been using for the last 7 years, it's the distro I use daily, it's the distro I like the best (and I'm not ashamed to say I've tried many (in fact, at this moment I even have Ubuntu on my Toshiba Libretto which is more or less waiting for me to get around to sticking Mandriva 2007 on it instead)), and it's the distro developed by the company I work for.  It's the obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At any rate I'm less than impressed. Well, with this. Mandriva 2007 seems pretty nice so far (well, I installed RC2 and synced up with cooker right after the install). The 3d desktop is of less importance to me than getting vmware server working on it, but it would have been nice to play with since this is one of the premier features. Sadly, I need a lot more hand-holding than I'm getting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok folks, I know I'm asking the impossible here, but could you actually &lt;i&gt;read&lt;/i&gt; that paragraph?  Oh, you did?  I kindly invite you to read it again.  No, really read it.  Come on, it's written in good english.  It's not too difficult to understand.  &lt;i&gt;READ IT!&lt;/i&gt;  Oh, sorry, didn't mean to get excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does it actually say?  It says that I'm less than impressed &lt;i&gt;with the experience of setting up the commercial ATI drivers&lt;/i&gt; (yes, I'm actually reading it in context, what a novelty!).  It does not say I'm less than impressed with Mandriva.  Nor does it say I'm less than impressed with any experience of Mandriva.  (For what it's worth, the day after I wrote that, I tried with SUSE on the same machine with the same results... no DRI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh!  Oh!  How about this little nugget:  &lt;i&gt;Mandriva 2007 seems pretty nice so far&lt;/i&gt;.  Umm... if I didn't like it, would I say it?  I think most people who know me, by now know that I speak my mind (which has gotten me into trouble on more than one occassion, granted).  If I thought Mandriva 2007 was garbage, I probably would have said so.  (Ok, well maybe not, but I wouldn't have called it nice either).  No, the fact that I called it "pretty nice" implies that I liked it.  You don't call your wife pretty nice if you plan to divorce her.  Well, not if you're honest at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then go on to say that the 3d desktop is of less importance to me, which means I can live without it.  It also means that I can &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; the distro without this feature.  It didn't say I was going to trash the install looking for something easier (which I did end up doing, but didn't find anything easier, and went back to installing Mandriva 2007 back on that same machine and FWIW, I got the 3d desktop stuff working today anyways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm still a) not seeing any anti-Mandriva PR here nor b) seeing how it could be remotely construed as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I don't think the problem with Linux on the desktop is Linux... Linux, and the associated bits and pieces make a fine desktop. It works really really well. The problem is how the desktop compares with other desktops.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, here it is.  Here is exactly where I say that Linux on the desktop is garbage.  Oh... wait a second.  What's this "fine desktop" business?!?  How the heck did that get in there?  Oh, right, I wrote it.  What?  &lt;i&gt;It works really really well.&lt;/i&gt;  What the... heresy!  Someone must be editing this behind my back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you just need a functional, no eye-candy, all business desktop... look no further than any Linux distro with an X server.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Groan.&lt;/i&gt;  Those dang imps are at it again wrecking my perfectly sensible anti-Linux and anti-Mandriva blog entry.  Damn them all!  What is this nonsense?  Here I'm actually &lt;i&gt;endorsing&lt;/i&gt; Linux on the desktop?  That can't be right...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now I'm gonna qualify the only anti-anything part of my blog entry.  Yes, the anti-kernel-developer statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now if those kernel-developing idiots would get there act together and give us a 2.6 kernel that was a) stable and b) supported for more than a week, then I'd really be pleased.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok.  Here's the deal.  Before the 2.6 kernel, it was easy to figure out what was what.  2.2 was stable, 2.3 was development.  When it was done it became the 2.4 kernel.  Then we went to 2.6.  The old style of development made more sense... develop on the 2.5 branch and when it was deemed stable, start the 2.6 branch and work on 2.7 for development.  But this hasn't happened.  Instead, we have a 2.6 kernel that has API changes from version to version, we have massive changes from version to version, we have things like XFS working in 2.6.16 and then causing massive filesystem corruption in 2.6.17.  What the hell is this?  We have a driver in one 2.6 version being changed and renamed in a later version (here I'm referring to the sk98lin driver although I don't think it's impossible that this hasn't happened with other drivers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is there is no possible way anyone can look at the 2.6 kernel as being anything other than a rapidly-moving development kernel.  It has changes that are too intrusive between versions.  It has inexecusable problems that crop up between versions (thinking of XFS here).  It has an insane number of security vulnerabilities.  &lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; is supposed to be the kernel we &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the kernel we want to use.  Why?  Better support for more devices.  Some really nice features.  There are any number of compelling reasons to use the 2.6 kernel, and just as many not to.  Unfortunately, the 2.4 kernel is in major maintenance mode... it's not getting any new features.  Unless you're running a server (and even then), the 2.4 kernel is just plain old too old.  I had resisted moving my servers to the 2.6 kernel for so long, but now I almost don't have a choice.  Better SATA support?  Need the 2.6 kernel.  AppArmor support?  Need the 2.6 kernel.  For the SELinux folks who want that support?  The 2.6 kernel.  Better performance?  The 2.6 kernel.  Newer gigabit drivers?  The 2.6 kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More instability?  The 2.6 kernel.  More insecurity?  The 2.6 kernel.  More problems moving from one "minor" version to the next?  The 2.6 kernel.  Moving from 2.4.16 to 2.4.17 was probably a no-brainer (been a while, I don't really remember).  Moving from 2.6.16 to 2.6.17?  Watch out.. it'll eat your XFS partitions and the data you choose to store on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, I think the kernel developers are idiots.  They're so concerned with new this and new that that they're forgetting the people that actually &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; it.  They're forgetting that not everyone wants to run the equivalent of Mandriva's cooker or Red Hat's rawhide.  Not everyone wants to run a development kernel in production.  What we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; want is a stable kernel that we can use and know will be maintained with minimal and non-intrusive changes for some time to come.  I want a kernel that I can upgrade without worrying what will break or what new userspace tools I need or any other concern besides compiling and rebooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn't going to happen anytime soon.  The kernel developers have essentially left the onus on the Linux vendors to grab a development kernel and attempt to stabilize it themselves, which means backporting fixes because the kernel developers have moved on to the next cool thing.  I understand the "geek" nature here, but they're doing the Linux community a disservice by not simply saying "ok, the 2.6 kernel is done, now it's time to move on to the 2.7 or 2.8 kernel".  Then the 2.4 kernel can be officially retired, and people can maintain (stabilize, provide security fixes for, etc.) a 2.6 kernel that people can feel confident in using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because the 2.6 kernel has been a development kernel for so long, and the 2.4 kernel is minimally maintained, we're basically hooped.  We can use something on the verge of being obsolete, or we can play with a development kernel.  There is no middle ground.  There is no recent stable kernel.  Why is this so hard to figure out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to qualify here that there was some talk of making the 2.6.16 kernel the "stable" kernel but I really wonder how well this is going to work out.  I'd really like it if it did work out, and I really hope that it does, but I think that the decision of a "stable" kernel needs to be made by the entire kernel development team and/or leadership, and I sincerely believe that means that they need to stop playing with 2.6 and move on to another major version number (like 2.7) and then it won't just be a handful of people wanting to do it, but something the entire kernel community stands behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that's enough of that.  This post here is basically to a) maintain that yes, the kernel developers are, in my opinion, idiots and b) that the Distrowatch folks are idiots too.  At least the kernel people can read... seems to me like that basic skill is lost on the Distrowatch folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and for those people leaving comments on the Distrowatch thread who are saying "that's it for Mandriva, time to look at SUSE or Ubuntu", if you're basing that decision on the sensationalistic anti-journalism of Distrowatch and not on your own experiences, then shame on you.  Are you sheep that you do what others tell you without any thought or questioning on your part?  If so, then I pity you.  If you read the Distrowatch "news" and then actually followed the link to read the blog postings by Fabrice and myself, you'd realize that Distrowatch is completely incompetent and incapable of anything even remotely resembling "journalism" or even worthy "news reporting".  And if you read Distrowatch, without reading the blog entries in question, and took it at face value, then I really feel sorry for you because you've allowed someone else to form an opinion for you and have given up your freedom of personal thought to a pack of irresponsible or even, dare I say it, malicious individuals (because their spin on this is either incompetent or malicious... take your pick)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, this is my &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; blog.  This is not a vehicle of Mandriva PR.  This is not even a Mandriva-hosted or Mandriva-sponsored or even remotely Mandriva-related blog.  This is where I have my little corner of the web to speak my own mind.  What I say here is not Mandriva's opinion, policy, or anything else that could be construed as even remotely "official Mandriva".  This is the opinion of one simple guy who happens to work for Mandriva.  And I feel bad that what I wrote was so misconstrued and interpretted in such a misleading way, but I cannot apologize for being a free-thinking individual with a personal opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So shame on you, Distrowatch.  I hope people read you as they read OSNews... with a handful of salt and a distinctly &lt;i&gt;non-sheep&lt;/i&gt; mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva 2007, ATI Radeon Xpress 200, and Xgl</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mandriva-2007-ati-radeon-xpress-200-and-xgl" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-10-02T12:22:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-10-02T12:22:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-10-02:/blog/mandriva-2007-ati-radeon-xpress-200-and-xgl</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, wow, if I didn't expect to get the "anti-Mandriva" coverage based on a previous post.

So, as a result, I determined to get the ATI drivers working.  The big difference here is that this time I'm using the 32bit Mandriva rather than 64bit; no idea if that's making a big difference but I did find some help doing more googling (and no, there is no /usr/share/fglrx/fglrx.README with the latest ATI drivers so poo on the guy who said I didn't read docs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's a quick HOWTO on getting this stuff up and running (or, at least, how I did):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Grab the ATI commercial drivers from the &lt;a href="https://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894&amp;task=knowledge&amp;folderID=300"&gt;ATI driver downloads page&lt;/a&gt;
2) Follow the instructions on how to install it (essentially "sh ati-driver-install-8.29.6.run" and then follow the instructions)
3) Run "aticonfig --initial"
4) In my case, the aticonfig added a second monitor, I suppose that might be the TV out.  Doesn't really matter.  The big thing I found was that I needed to set "Composite" to "Disable" in the "Extensions" section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  As soon as I did this, glxinfo and fglrxinfo started telling me that direct rendering was enabled and that I was using the "RADEON XPRESS" OpenGL renderer rather than Mesa.  Oh, and make sure that screen0 is set to use the fglrx driver instead of the ati driver (aticonfig setup screen1 to use fglrx, but was still using ati on screen0).
5) You need to install libstdc++5 in order for the fglrx module to load properly (unfortunatley, this package is in contribs); without this I couldn't get the fglrx kernel module to load (perhaps the ATI dkms packages negate this requirement, but I used the downloaded drivers)
6) Once I had rebooted (to make sure the kernel fglrx driver was loaded), then I could run drak3d and enable Xgl and compiz and get the fancy cube and jiggly windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyways it works.  With Xgl and Compiz enabled, however, fluxbox isn't very happy.  Things look nice and slick in KDE, but fluxbox doesn't handle it overly well (dragging a window around leaves a trail so your desktop looks pretty messed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't tried yet with the dkms-ati package yet.  I'll do that later when I have more time.  At any rate, it does work.  I think it was that "Composite" extension that was causing me grief the first time around, and none of the sites I looked at before even mentioned it (finally found it in this &lt;a href="http://www.phoronix.net/forums/showthread.php?t=243"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about FC6).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva development wiki conversion</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mandriva-development-wiki-conversion" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-09-30T20:47:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-09-30T20:47:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-09-30:/blog/mandriva-development-wiki-conversion</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I brought up, on the maintainers@ mailing list, the question that had been dicussed a few months ago and discussed &lt;a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=mandrake-cooker&amp;w=2&amp;r=3&amp;s=mediawiki&amp;q=b"&gt;on the cooker list&lt;/a&gt; from about April-June, regarding the restructing of the &lt;a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MandrivaLinux"&gt;Mandriva Linux Development Community wiki&lt;/a&gt; with the possibility of moving if from that hideous POS TWiki …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I brought up, on the maintainers@ mailing list, the question that had been dicussed a few months ago and discussed &lt;a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=mandrake-cooker&amp;w=2&amp;r=3&amp;s=mediawiki&amp;q=b"&gt;on the cooker list&lt;/a&gt; from about April-June, regarding the restructing of the &lt;a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MandrivaLinux"&gt;Mandriva Linux Development Community wiki&lt;/a&gt; with the possibility of moving if from that hideous POS TWiki to something a whole lot more extensible and faster, MediaWiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What came of the first discussion (which spanned about three months) was &lt;a href="http://beta.thelinuxfr.org/index.php?title=Accueil"&gt;this demo site&lt;/a&gt; which, while looking pretty, has a whole bunch of (in my mind) flaws to it... primarily that it looks too much like the &lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Welcome_to_openSUSE.org"&gt;OpenSUSE wiki&lt;/a&gt; (it's really really scary how similar they look), and it's also really difficult to read.  Yes, style can be changed quite easily, but I think the focus of this demo site was solely on style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current state of the wiki is awful... it's really difficult to find anything and TWiki is &lt;i&gt;slow&lt;/i&gt;.  MediaWiki is much nicer and much faster and it looks a whole lot better.  So, to that end, I spent pretty much all day (besides heading outside to mow down some flowers to prepare for winter) setting up a new MediaWiki install that can be used instead of TWiki.  Unlike the previous demo, my goal was not to make it look nice (although I don't think it looks bad, and I think it looks better than the current TWiki), but I wanted to make it a logical "structure" so that it would make &lt;i&gt;sense&lt;/i&gt; and things are laid out logically.  The problem with the current TWiki is that there are no real rules to it, and no hierarchy.  It, honestly, looks like the desk in my office.  And, like my desk, makes it damn near impossible to find anything without a lot of effort and cussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously it's far from complete.  The idea I have in mind is to migrate not only the developer wiki but the &lt;a href="http://mandriva.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;Mandriva Community wiki&lt;/a&gt; (which I also host and instigated years ago and which also went through a TWiki to MediaWiki migration) into one big "Mandriva wiki".  When I look at other distributions and their wikis, most of them look pretty good and are well laid-out.  Ours is pure anarchy.  And I think it reflects poorly on us.  Not only that, but why on earth should we have multiple wikis (Community wiki, Developers wiki, Club wiki) when one would suffice and everyone could pool the information and talent to work on a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; project?  A "one-stop resource" for all things Mandriva, if you will.  I suppose, as a result, that it should probably not be hosted on the "qa" machine (with Bugzilla) but on it's own machine or, at the very least, be named "wiki.mandriva.com" instead of qa.mandriva.com/wiki/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, you've been in suspence long enough.  You can check out what I've done at &lt;a href="http://mdv.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;mdv.vmlinuz.ca&lt;/a&gt;.  Please sign up for an account and help convert data from TWiki over to it.  I've started, but it's slow going... if I could devote an entire week to this, I could probably do it all on my own (I did the community wiki in 3 days).  I figure if we have something in place that's pretty close or at least on it's way to being done, and don't squabble over CSS and layout issues, then we have a real shot at replacing that awful TWiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I figure it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission, so I went ahead and started it (which seems to be something of a habit with me and web resources for Mandriva).  Hopefully it'll pan out (most of the other initiatives I've over the years have, so I don't expect this one to be much different).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Of Bugzilla Clients</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/of-bugzilla-clients" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-09-28T22:35:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-09-28T22:35:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-09-28:/blog/of-bugzilla-clients</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael Scherer &lt;A href="http://archives.mandrivalinux.com/cooker/2006-09/msg08080.php"&gt;posted to cooker@&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago about putting &lt;a href="http://www.liquidx.net/pybugz/"&gt;PyBugz&lt;/a&gt; a devilishly cool python app for querying a bugzilla database into cooker.

&lt;p&gt;Well, he was wrong, it still doesn't work with Deskzilla.  Our bugzilla is pretty hacked up, so it's not too surprising.. it seems to me that it deviates quite a bit from standard bugzilla.  FWIW, Deskzilla works great with the Annvix bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyBugz, on the other hand, seems to be a great query tool for our bugzilla.  It seems to be quite Gentoo-centric (which is ok), so it doesn't work to post a new bug to bugzilla.  It does work to submit a comment to bugzilla, however, and authentication works, which is great.  The problem is, as I just discovered, if you submit a comment to a private bug (our "group" feature... I have no idea if this is from bugzilla or something we added, but you can have bugs appear only to certain groups; we use it for hiding security-related issues), it unsets the group flag (effectively making a security-related bug from being private to public).  Note to self... do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; use PyBugz to post comments to our bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for a query tool it works like a hot damn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I thought I'd mention how slick this thing is... I'm pretty impressed by it.  Seems to be a lot faster than trying to use the web interface directly and could also be scriptable to create reports of how good (or bad) people are doing with their bugs (not to mention possibly creating customized daily TODO lists)... the possibilities are pretty limitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, for anyone wanting to use this on OS X, you should download the latest python from &lt;a href="http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/index.html"&gt;pythonmac&lt;/a&gt;, which is 2.4.3 (fink only has 2.4.2, and OS X 10.4 comes with 2.3.5).  You'll also want to grab the current svn version of PyBugz (it doesn't work very well with the 0.6 tarball release on the site), and you'll also need to download &lt;a href="http://effbot.org/downloads/index.cgi#elementtree"&gt;ElementTree&lt;/a&gt;, which PyBugz requires (very easy to install python module).  Install the updated Python &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; however and make sure the PATH is setup and such appropriatly before installing ElementTree or it could get installed in the wrong place.  Once you do that, it'll work peachy on OS X.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I'll never use Linux for my main desktop</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/why-ill-never-use-linux-for-my-main-desktop" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-09-25T21:58:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-09-25T21:58:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-09-25:/blog/why-ill-never-use-linux-for-my-main-desktop</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This might sound a little harsh coming from a guy who's worked for a Linux company for over six years, but things never seem to get easier.

Oh sure, the stuff that was hard to deal with &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; time is easier, but the new features and the stuff you want to check out &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; time are just as hard as the old crap was last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, there's all this talk about the 3D Desktop stuff in Mandriva.  Well, I like eye candy so I want to check it out.  I don't have a sloucher of a machine either so I know for sure it'll be able to take whatever can be thrown at it.  It's an &lt;a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=1843651&amp;docname=c00619308"&gt;HP Media Centrt PC m7470n&lt;/a&gt; which is essentially an Athlon 64 X2 4200+ (2.2GHz), 2GB RAM, ATI Radeon Xpress 200, 300GB SATA drive, and all the other media/TV tuner crap that came with it (it was a powerful machine for a really smoking good price).  At any rate, it should be able to handle turning my desktop into a funky cube or whatever the 3d desktop is supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well apparently my system is unsupported.  So I spent about 2 hours tonight dicking around, installing the ATI dkms stuff, then realizing I needed the ati rpm, then I had installed the ati-kernel rpm which conflicted with the dkms so I removed the ati-kernel rpm and it still wouldn't work so "dkms status" was telling me nothing so I removed and reinstalled the ati-dkms rpm and in between all of these things I was rebooting just to ensure that stuff would work properly.  Well half the time it wasn't loading the fglrx module in the kernel, then I had to configure with XFdrake, and it wonked my xorg.conf a bit, then things looked better but glxgears was still only giving me 180FPS which I'm pretty sure is bad, and I'm perusing the Mandriva cooker twiki and the output from glxinfo and finally realize that for some bizarre reason direct rendering is not enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I look in my Xorg.log files and lo and behold I see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
(WW) fglrx(0): ***********************************************
(WW) fglrx(0): * DRI initialization failed!                  *
(WW) fglrx(0): * (maybe driver kernel module missing or bad) *
(WW) fglrx(0): * 2D acceleraton available (MMIO)             *
(WW) fglrx(0): * no 3D acceleration available                *
(WW) fglrx(0): ********************************************* *
...
(II) fglrx(0): Acceleration enabled
(II) fglrx(0): Direct rendering disabled
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well WTF?!?  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;AAAARGGGHH!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you shitting me?  I've spent two hours getting the damn ATI kernel module installed, lsmod most &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; tells me that fglrx is loaded and I get this?  Suffice it say I gave up.  But I'm a stubborn guy so I'll qualify that with a "for now". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate I'm less than impressed.  Well, with this.  Mandriva 2007 seems pretty nice so far (well, I installed RC2 and synced up with cooker right after the install).  The 3d desktop is of less importance to me than getting vmware server working on it, but it would have been nice to play with since this is one of the premier features.  Sadly, I need a lot more hand-holding than I'm getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of thing is precisely why, for me, Linux belongs on the server.  Now if those kernel-developing idiots would get there act together and give us a 2.6 kernel that was a) stable and b) supported for more than a week, then I'd really be pleased.  I don't think the problem with Linux on the desktop is Linux... Linux, and the associated bits and pieces make a fine desktop.  It works really really well.  The problem is how the desktop compares with &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; desktops.  If you just need a functional, no eye-candy, all business desktop... look no further than any Linux distro with an X server.  If you want something fun and fancy prepare to either obtain that with wall paper and skins/themes or a few hours of cussing out your machine.  Frankly, I don't have the time to waste on something on that should just plain work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm ranting... =)  It pisses me off that I can't get that cuby thing on my spanky machine in a reasonable amount of time (I'd be more than happy to invest half an hour, but upwards of 2hrs?  Come on!).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Sudo rules</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/sudo-rules" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-09-04T11:12:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-09-04T11:12:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-09-04:/blog/sudo-rules</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend sent me a link to &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/c149.html"&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt; about the powers of sudo.

I've been writing for &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/"&gt;TechRepublic&lt;/a&gt; for about 6-7 years now, and every month I write these little tips called "TechMails".  They don't pay a whole lot, but I enjoy doing it as it gives me a reason to look at new and different things, which keeps me (moderately) fresh on new stuff that's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of adding &lt;a href="http://www.openwall.com/tcb/"&gt;tcb&lt;/a&gt; support into &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/"&gt;Annvix&lt;/a&gt; recently, I used that as a TechMail topic that went up just a little while ago.  TechMails don't allow me the depth that I'd like to get, so they sometimes end up being a quick pass at something intended to get the reader interested in something they may never have heard of before and go check it out for themself if what I've written about sounds interesting to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this morning I see on Linux Today a title that looks awfully familiar, so I go check it out and it leads me to &lt;a href="http://www.builderau.com.au/program/linux/soa/Migrating_from_shadow_passwords_to_tcb_in_Linux/0,39028297,39269540,00.htm"&gt;this article on Builder AU&lt;/a&gt;.  Now, Builder AU seems to be the "australian" Builder.com which is owned by CNET, as is TechRepublic (I've written a few things for Builder.com in the past too).  It just cracks me up that the TechMail originally written for TechRepublic with it's home &lt;a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com/5100-1035-6107316.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; ended up on the Australian version of Builder.com.  The title of the article, btw, is "Migrating from shadow passwords to tcb in Linux" and I really recommend it to anyone who (or any distro) that wants to step up the local password security of their system/distro.  It works &lt;i&gt;fantastic&lt;/i&gt;.  (Thanks, Solar!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FWIW, if anyone wants more info, it's pretty easy to implement although it does require a few compiles/recompiles and a wee bit of patching.  The original article on TechRepublic there covers a bit, the Openwall tcb page covers more, and the &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/index.php/Documentation/tcb"&gt;Annvix documentation on tcb&lt;/a&gt; covers some more functional implementation areas (a HOWTO, of sorts, on how to get the system using tcb after everything is built and installed).&lt;/p&gt;

I've even been known to buy copies of distros just to check them out (well, I've bought SUSE and YellowDog and downloaded the rest... particularly because those ones were available locally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having messed around with a few distros these last few weeks, mostly for some comparisons for Annvix (install size, "out-of-the-box" memory usage, etc.). I've come to the conclusion that Linux desktops are getting fatter, slower, and more buggy.  Some, like the latest SUSE, I couldn't even get to install in vmware without a boat-load of work, and even then I only managed to do it once (I knew I should have taken notes).  When I played with FC4 it seemed ok, but I just don't like the feel of Red Hat/Fedora... never have.  I admire the work they do, for the most part, but the distro just seems spartan to me.  I'm probably not being overly fair as I've used Fedora for maybe a maximum of 5 hours... 3 of those I'm sure were helping my dad get it installed on his system.  I've also heard that FC5 is a lot worse than FC4 was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Ubuntu had some wierd install issues.  I have it running on my Libretto since it seems to be the one distro that will handle all the hardware on that machine and it's ok... Debian-style distros aren't really my thing tho.  I'll give them a thumbs up on hardware support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about my beloved Mandriva?  Well, I have to be careful here as I don't want to get in trouble but... well, I'm a little disappointed with the 2007 beta.  Now, BIG DISCLAIMER!  It's a beta.  I realize this.  There's probably a lot of stuff to be fixed.  Unfortunately, it's still a moving target... there's no such thing as a freeze or a bug-squishing phase or even a phase to make it really solid, or at least, historically there hasn't been.  Here's to change and hoping there will be one.  Because the beta has left me a little... underwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks pretty slick... I like the dual-arch DVD ISO idea... if only it would work properly.  On my amd64 laptop I thought I was installing the 32bit version when, to my surprise, I found out post-install it was the 64bit version and the installer offers me no option to install the 32bit version.  Pity because I can't run my laptop wireless with WPA2 security in 64bit since the 64bit windows drivers I have for ndiswrapper don't support WPA2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other issues with the installer, and some post-install stuff... I'm sure it'll all get fixed at some point.  But I had to jump through some serious hoops in order to make some things work.  Things that the average user wouldn't have a clue about.  I've been doing this a while so it's not hard for me... just time consuming and a PITA.  Especially when things should be at the point where they just WORK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm only 30, but I've been doing the computer thing for a while.  When I was younger (relatively speaking), I enjoyed tinkering.  Figuring out how things worked, debugging, testing, spending all hours of the night getting one thing to work properly was a challenge, and it was fun.  Now I'm too busy.  I want things to just WORK.  (Oh, I'm not ranting about Mandriva here in particular... this goes for all Linux desktop distros).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands right now, I'd rather spend the time I used to spend tinkering with my kid, or reading a book, or playing a game, or hanging out with my wife.  I spend at least 12 hours a day in front of computers working.  I don't want to spend my spare time trying to get a machine to work properly, as that takes away time from other things that at this point I find more fun, more entertaining, and just plain more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see all kinds of new features coming into Linux distros.  There is a massive amount of feature-creep.  There's also a massive amount of bugs and other oddities that really just irritate me now.  I find myself angrier with my Linux boxen these days than I recall being with Windows machines in the past (well, maybe not, but it's getting pretty darn close).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, I think, is differing opinions and the "please everyone all the time" mentality.  I see this over and over again and it's nothing if not problematic.  For instance, on cooker the other day someone was saying that "the people" (whoever they are) want packages... lots and lots and LOTS of packages.  The more the merrier.  He also had the absolutely idiotic notion that maintainers a) use and b) test their packages.  The problem with all of these packages (as if we like to sit around and thump our chests saying "MY distro has 132 more packages than YOURS does!") is that there are more packages and less people interested and willing to use and/or test them.  So distros end up shipping stuff that is half-tested (at best).  I mean, look at the Mandriva beta.  Some of the stuff I found shouldn't have ever been there.  I'm assuming people boot the thing, I'm sure someone has tested the installer before making an ISO with it.. so why are these things not fixed?  I'm thinking they're pretty minor.  Same goes with stuff I found with SUSE.  Good Lord, had no one tried installing SUSE in vmware during beta testing?  If one person would have, they would have seen that it just plain old doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet it was shipped like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I the only person getting tired of seeing half-assed stuff?  Now, again, I need to reiterate here that while the Mandriva beta prompted this, this is something I've been noticing for a long time.  There is a distinct lessening of quality across &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; distros that I've played with (not that I've played with a lot, or even comitted much time to them).  Some people will insist I need to spend more time with something.  I have to respectfully disagree.  If it doesn't work, more or less out of the box (I can deal with some tinkering), I'm not interested.  I don't want to spend two days getting my hardware working properly.  I want to spend two days tweaking my apps, fiddling with skins and desktop backgrounds and themes.  I want to spend time doing fun and interesting things with my computer... not cursing at it because it tells me it can't find some firmware for my network card that the previous version of the distro didn't have a problem with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't Mandriva-specific at all.  In fact, I think the beta, as far as it is, is pretty good for a first beta.  Aside from some installer issues and some boot issues, there doesn't seem to be too much staring me in the face (although my menus seem to be pretty spartan for some reason).  If these things can get fixed for the next beta, I think it'll be pretty good.  Of course, one has to wonder about the converse as well... it's been almost a year that this thing has been in the works so why the really obvious bugs?  (I don't know how the development thing works, in particular to respect to new versions of stuff, stability testing, QA, etc. because I haven't dealt with R&amp;amp;D for years so I have to honestly, from a user's perspective, wonder this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the Linux community has been imitating Windows for so long that they've finally succumbed to things they had Windows beat on a long time ago... things like bloat, things like instability, things like wonky hardware issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'm just tired because I've spent a few hours cussing at installs today... I've installed the 2007 beta, and I also had to install some other versions in vmware (Corporate Desktop 3 and 2006).  All of them have issues.  Hell, every Linux distro I've tried in the last 2 years have had issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering when we're going to stop having issues and start having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to stop ranting and go read my book.

Instead of leaving a comment there and having it lost in the 100+ comments, I decided to respond here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, Bryan is in for a surprise!  His essential argument is community... how mac users are rabid, mean, petty, etc.  And yeah, I can see that.  But come on... to imply that the Linux community is all happy roses?  Give me a break.  Granted, there are a number of "Linux communities", and they tend to be distro-centric, but I've known plenty of petty, pissy, malicious Linux users and some communities are downright nasty.  Of course, Bryan has the first few months of using Linux and it probably looks pretty good so far, and maybe Ubuntu has a better community than some others, but to make a sweeping statement that the Linux community is nicer than the mac one is... well.. naive, and hopelessly optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish him luck.. Linux is, obviously, a great OS and there are some kick ass people in the Linux community.  There's also some pretty rotten, foul, and really evil people here too.  His main argument to switch is "community".  I've found that both communities are largely similar...  the mac community is rabid and defensive... the linux community is rabid and zealous.  I've been dealing with the Linux communty from a "vendor" perspective for over 6 years.  I've been a user for 8.  We have not gotten rid of the zealotry that infected the Linux community 6 years ago.  Hell, it's gotten worse.  A lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to avoid "community" as much as possible.  I find it more irritating than useful.  I use Linux, I support Linux, I consult on Linux, I develop a Linux distro, I do updates for another... I'm pretty much as immersed in Linux as you can get.  I also use a mac.  Unfortunately, on the Linux side I have no choice but to be involved in the community.  On the mac side... I don't bother whatsoever.  Why?  Maybe I'm anti-social, maybe I'd rather have a community of real people... family, friends.. individuals I can deal with on a face-to-face basis without hiding behind a glossy monitor where the only interaction with most people is the click-click of keyboard keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that's not to say I don't have some fantastic "online" friends that I've never met and frankly, I'm disappointed that I couldn't make it to Paris a few weeks back to met some of my "online" friends and co-workers.  "Online" friends aren't a bad thing... but to "hang out" with an online community?  Well, I can do without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't put much stock in the whole community thing.  Yes, peers are useful to obtain help, to give help when required, and to simply learn.. but he makes it sound like he's looking for a bunch of buddies that are less rude than the last bunch of buddies he had.  That makes him switch operating systems?  From a technical standpoint.. Linux and Mac both have their strong suits and downfalls.  I prefer OS X on my desktop, but I won't put anything but Linux on a server.  That's simply personal preference and the fact that I'd rather not tinker if I can avoid it... I have far too much to do to spend 3 days trying to get a fricking wirless card working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my point is about switching operating systems to suit the "community".  This fellow makes software for a living.  I wish him the best of luck but I think once he starts developing Linux software "for-pay" he's going to find the mac community is more willing to pay than the linux community.  And I speak from extensive experience on this point.  It's the Linux community (by and large) that wants everything free, everything better, everything faster, and always at the expense of someone else and never themselves.  Pity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>RSBAC and AppArmor</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/rsbac-and-apparmor" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-07-04T09:40:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-07-04T09:40:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-07-04:/blog/rsbac-and-apparmor</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've taken the last week of June "off" from doing updates to look into RSBAC and AppArmor because I'm not convinced that the Mandriva implementation of RSBAC will be user-friendly or transparent, nor very "out-of-the-box".

This was the result of my asking why we are persisting with RSBAC (which can be complicated and very intrusive for a desktop system) when AppArmor is available and it's a lot easier to configure and use.  The answer I got was "we have two months until betas approx and now is too late to change technologies".  Well, to be blunt, I don't buy this at all.  I know that Thierry is working on a drak tool for configuring RSBAC, but knowing how short-sighted we can be at Mandriva at times, I wanted more details.  The bottom line was there would be a tool to configure RSBAC, but no default policies shipped (which means no "out-of-the-box" RSBAC support nor, I'm suspecting, RSBAC being enabled by default).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses two problems for me.  One, if we don't have sensible defaults, the end user has nothing to build up from... everything is done from scratch.  This is ok for the "hackers" who like to fiddle, but people like me who just want to &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; the computer will have to invest a few hours in learning how to configure RSBAC properly and then testing/debugging to make sure the policies don't break things.  The other problem is that if RSBAC isn't enabled by default, how many people will know it exists, and how many will actually enable it?  And once they find out they need to configure it themselves, how many will then promptly turn it off or, worst-case-scenario, enable it, not have it configured, and then not be able to log in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is my analysis of how we (Mandriva) should proceed with RSBAC and if or whether we should use AppArmor and what the TTD (Time To Deliver) would be for both technologies, and what would be involved, as well as the pro's and con's of both technologies.  Considering I've only taken a week (and can't really invest more time into this at the moment or risk the wrath of Stew), this may not be 100% accurate and it certainly isn't complete, but this is the findings I've found so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And rather than post a long message for discussion on the maintainers@ mailing list, and cc'ing the kernel team, I decided to put this here to get a little more exposure and a reference point for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's look at a few of the issues that concern RSBAC and AppArmor independantly, without looking AT what we need to do as a distribution to successfully ship a "hardening technology", be it RSBAC, AppArmor, or both.  Then we'll get into the Mandriva-specific stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, there seems to be a misconception that AppArmor and RSBAC are similar technologies.  They are similar in some respects, true, but they are very different as well.  First off, RSBAC is an "overall" hardening solution.  It has a lot of very cool and very neat features, and the nice thing is that it's modular so it's not an "all or nothing" system.  RSBAC's AUTH, ACL, MAC, and other technologies are great for really restricting the capabilities of various programs and processes.  RSBAC even has an in-kernel authentication system that replaces traditional shadow password management, which is cool.  Obviously, I don't believe it is Mandriva's goal to enable and provide all of these features.  Even Annvix, which is security-oriented, has no plans to enable all of these features, so it stands to reason that Mandriva won't be going the extra mile to have a full RSBAC-provisioned system.  Which is fine.  RSBAC is an overall hardening and securing solution that is proven and reliable.  Unfortunately, the RSBAC docs are geared primarily to RSBAC developers.  In other words, RSBAC documentation is shit for the average joe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AppArmor, on the other hand, has a lot of really great docs.  And it isn't a "system-hardening" system.  AppArmor is more of an application firewall.  It restricts and allows certain capabilities of files and programs.  The documentation even suggests that AppArmor is not really useful for securing all applications, but primarily "forward-facing" programs, and by this I mean network-enabled services that interact with humans and have a high probability that if there is something wrong with the app, it can be contained to operating on certain levels.  For instance, if a problem exists in Apache that allows an attacker to view any file on the system that user apache has access to, using AppArmor we can prevent Apache from looking anywhere beyond it's configuration files and web data.  We can prevent it from looking randomly in /etc (like /etc/passwd, etc.) with some basic policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One distinct disadvantage to RSBAC is the lack of easy-to-use tools, but this is where the drak tool comes in.  The drak tool will, presumably, make it easy to create, manipulate, and delete policies.  This is important because RSBAC's configuration is database-driven to the extent that it's not easily manipulated by "human hands".  On the other hand, AppArmor uses a series of text files to configure itself which can be edited by vim, or any other text editor on the system provided you have sufficient privilege to edit the file.  This does, of course, make the policies more susceptible to tampering, but good use of permissions and ACLs could reduce this probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well, with RSBAC, you can make root as privileged as user joe meaning that root can have as much, or as little, privilege as you like.  No such provision exists with AppArmor, meaning you need to realize root is still all-powerful and no amount of permission manipulation and ACLs will prevent someone who has gotten root privileges from borking your system.  The goal, then, is to make sure that no one can get root privs in the first place.  This is much easier to achieve if the system is a single-user system or a trusted multi-user system (like most desktops and/or home computers, and possibly office computers as well).  This is a little tricker to accomplish on a server, but it can be done.  RSBAC provides even better options to achieve this goal, but it doesn't mean it's impossible to do &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; RSBAC.  For instance, simple no-brainers like using SSH keys, appropriate firewall settings, etc. go a lot further to protect a system than some people realize.  None of them are silver-bullets on their own, but each add another defensive layer making it more difficult to appropriate unauthorized access or privilege on a system and, after all, there is no such thing as a fully secured system... everything we do is just adding layers to our "defense-in-depth" to make it as difficult as possible for someone to get anywhere they're not supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as was pointed out to me by some kernel developers and some LKML messages I read, the big perceived disadvantage to AppArmor is that it is path-based whereas other solutions (the LKML context was SELinux, rather than RSBAC, but the points are the same) take an inode-based approach.  The concern here is that someone can take, say, /bin/foo which has some AppArmor policy applied to it, hardlink it, then execute the hardlinked copy without any policy protection.  This too can be avoided for the most part with some decent filesystem mount options.  I say for the most part... it may not be foolproof.  Using the inode, of course, presents it's own challenges which will look at in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've had a brief look at both AppArmor and RSBAC, I'll address a few points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the drak tool, and the TTD.  Apparently we have two months to deliver this.  Which is wierd considering the decision to use RSBAC was made last year, AFAIK RSBAC support has been in the kernel since last year, the rsbac-admin tools have been in cooker since last year (in fact, they're in the 2006 release), but the tool is "in the works".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we use RSBAC, the assumption is we need a tool to configure it.  If we switched to AppArmor we'd need a tool too.  So either way, a tool needs to be written.  My understanding is it's currently being worked on, but isn't done.  So there might be a bit of a time-loss based on what's already been done, but I think the end result of a tool geared towards AppArmor versus one geared towards RSBAC would take less time.  For one, the RSBAC tool will be far more complicated due to how RSBAC handles it's configuration data.  With an AppArmor tool, you just need to manipulate plaintext files.  Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSBAC, on the other hand, requires more work.  For one, you need to either obtain all the configuration data from the rsbac.dat database in realtime to allow the user to manipulate them or you need to maintain a private plaintext copy of this that the tool can read and write.  Also remember RSBAC privilege; if a user makes it so that root can't execute RSBAC-related commands, then presumably root won't even be able to configure RSBAC with our tool (the preferred method of configuring RSBAC is to use the secoff (or uid 400) user).  So then we need to make our tool run as user secoff, which means we at the &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt; need an RSBAC policy to permit this, or use sudo/su to do it (but, again, a default policy would need to be in place to permit this).  Already the complexity is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's assume for the moment that we maintain our own private text configuration for all RSBAC policies and commands.  The advantages are this is easy to parse, easy to write, and then a backend process could be used to take that data and apply all the policies appropriately.  This could be a good thing, but it also precludes the use of normal RSBAC CLI tools because if a user makes changes on their own, our configs will be out of sync.  FWIW, this is how MNF handles it's configuration and I think it's a piss-poor way of doing it because you force the user to either a) use the tool exclusively or b) use the CLI tool(s) exclusively.  There is no middle ground because if you configure something with the tool, make changes with the CLI, the next invocation of the tool overwrites everything.  Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for our tool to be effective it needs to read data out of the RSBAC database, something that I'm assuming can only be done by secoff.  (Note, a lot of this assumption, I haven't actually attempted to configure RSBAC in this way to test this theory, so some of this could be flat-out wrong, but I don't think it's too far off the mark).  So our root-executed tool then needs to have privileges to get the data from user secoff (default policies again), then needs to manipulate the configuration as the user is changing/adding/deleting stuff (probably using a temporary configuration file of some sort), and then the tool needs to take the final changed configuration set, hand it off to secoff which would then run another tool to reapply all the policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're paying attention, you'll see that not only does there need to be multi-user interaction (root and secoff), but all of a sudden we're using two tools now.  One is the GUI configuration tool, the other is the "policy applicator" tool.  There would probably need to be a "policy extractor" tool as well.  Three tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here is where it becomes more interesting.  Remember the whole "inode is better than path-based" argument I noted above?  Remember the kernel developers telling me this was a good thing, trying to tout the whole "inode is better for security" drivel?  In theory this is great, and in practice for a well-supervised system this may be true.  But for a moving target (remember, RSBAC is to go into 2007, a desktop system, not Corporate Server 4 or a similar server/slightly-hardened system), like  a desktop, this isn't as useful, nor as easy to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little illustration should indicate my point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@ares tmp]# echo foo &gt;1; echo "1 is inode `ls -i 1`"; \
echo bar &gt;2; rm -f 1; echo cat &gt;3; echo foo2 &gt;1; \
echo "1 is inode `ls -i 1`"; echo "2 is inode `ls -i 2`"; \
echo "3 is inode `ls -i 3`"
1 is inode 4349024 1
1 is inode 4349026 1
2 is inode 4349025 2
3 is inode 4349024 3
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this little bit of silliness is doing is replicating what could/would happen during an RPM upgrade.  You'll notice we created "1" first then checked it's inode, then we created "2", deleted "1", created "3", then created "1" again.  You can see that the end result is that file "3" obtained the original file "1"'s inode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's nice, but rather meaningless unless you put it into context.  Assume "1" is /bin/login.  You have a system-wide default to disallow the use of /bin/login by anyone, then an exception to allow user joe to use it.  If /bin/login is replaced and it's inode changes, then the policy on /bin/login is now applied to a different file (or an unclaimed inode).  So /bin/login has the system-wide default on it, which is to disallow logins.  Well now no one, including joe, can login.  This could be used for any single file with a specific capability, ACL, or other policy applied to it.  Note that AppArmor, with it's (ridiculed) path-based approach wouldn't care about this.  /bin/login is /bin/login, regardless of the inode.  The AppArmor policies would continue to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking with the RSBAC developers and others on freenode, they indicated that in a situation like that, they just re-applied their policies.  Or, as one fellow said, he would reboot into a maintenance kernel, re-apply the policy (since he wasn't able to do it on his regular RSBAC-enabled kernel), then reboot again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask you... is this is a good thing to ask the user to do when, say, Evolution gets updated?  How about Firefox?  Hell, Windows doesn't even require a reboot when you upgrade firefox!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't really an option, as far as I'm concerned.  So the sensible thing would be to have a working copy of the policies (these fellows have a shellscript to apply policies... remember writing your own iptables/ipchains firewall rules in "firewall.sh"?  same idea applies).  With a copy of these policies we can hack rpm to, in some way, execute at the end of every single rpm installation transaction the policies.  I suppose it could be done after every installation (ie. urpmi install, so after a group of rpms), but that could possibly cause issues, even if they're temporary because polciies might be in flux and a package requiring a protected file may be invoked which was previously installed/upgraded and may have a misapplied policy).  Ideally, running the policy after every sole rpm installation would be good, but the overhead might not be appealing.  A trade off might be to hack urpmi instead, to have it run the "policy re-applicator" after every invocation.  But then the same hack needs to be done for apt, smart, rpmdrake, etc.  Either way, something needs to be done so that after an rpm transaction, the policies can be re-applied, automatically, so as to be transparent to the end user.  Now, this "policy re-applicator" could be the same app used by the drak tool to reapply policies after changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because here we don't have the advantage of runing drakbac (or whatever the tool will be called), we need to &lt;i&gt;get&lt;/i&gt; those policies first.  This means that after every rpm or urpmi/smart/apt/rpmdrake invocation we would need to execute our policy extractor to get the policies, then use that to re-apply them with the policy re-applicator.  Or we're looking back to our private RSBAC configuration file again so we don't have to go through the process of extracting the policies each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't forget that this stuff will need to be done via secoff, which means that (again) default policies need to be in place for rpm or urpmi/smart/apt/rpmdrake to be able to use secoff to a) get and b) apply the policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My head is starting to hurt, so let's switch gears and look at AppArmor in this case.  With AppArmor, you run your tool, configure it (manipulating plaintext files as root), and then you issue a "service apparmor reload" to re-read the plaintext configs and apply the new policies.  Wait... that's it?  Everything can be done as root?  One tool?  One simple command to reload the policies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think again to the TTD on all of this.  Remember we have 2 months.  Do you honestly think that in 2 months we can hack out a series of tools and changes to package managers to manage RSBAC?  Or do you think it more realistic to create one tool for AppArmor?  Seriously, if this would have been looked at when the decision was made to use RSBAC instead of SELinux, a lot of this could have been done by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in all fairness, I believe the RSBAC stuff is doable, even with all the goofiness I outlined above.  SELinux is inode based as well.  And it's being used in Fedora and RHAS or RHES or whatever RH calls their server product.  I suspect they came across these same (or similar) issues and managed them as well.  So it is probable that the same approach taken for SELinux support could be applied here.  For all I know, this capabilitity is available in SELinux or some user-land SELinux patches for rpm and/or other programs.  I don't know... I've never actually looked at SELinux before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a compromised solution could be done.  As I said, I've spent this week reading, playing, and looking around at this stuff.  Because I find the Mandriva kernel extremely painful to work on, I put 2.6.16.22 into Annvix, and added both RSBAC &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; AppArmor, together, in the kernel.  Because I don't much patch the Annvix kernel, these patches are the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; patches for the kernel.  Both apply, together, without rejects.  So it should be possible to do the same thing with the Mandriva kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been running this kernel for a few days, with AppArmor enabled and running, and with some RSBAC features enabled.  The features I disabled were UM (the user mangement stuff), the NET, AUTH, RC, ACL, MAC, PM, and PAX options.  I enabled the CAP, JAIL, DAZUKO, and FF features.  In other words, I'm using the more minor features of RSBAC and not the heavy lifting stuff that would interfere with me using the kernel without a lot of pre-configuration.  Some of the options I disabled could probably be enabled without conflict; I didn't try however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my point here is that the two &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; co-exist.  We could let AppArmor do the "application firewall" work because, quite frankly, it's the easiest and most transparent solution to the end user.  It's also the easiest for the end-user to use.  And since Mandriva is not a rock-solid-ultra-secure distro, the fact that we're using AppArmor for this as opposed to RSBAC won't be a bad thing.  Honestly, I'll take common sense here.  We could enable AppArmor, with default profiles, and have it running on first boot.  Everyone would use it.  We could use RSBAC, likely not have it enabled in every kernel (kernel-secure perhaps?) and have maybe 20% of our users using it (probably a generous figure).  If, as was indicated, we have no default policies to begin with and essentially warn the users they have an investment of a few hours to a few days depending on their proficiency, how many of those users will then disable RSBAC?  I'm guessing at least 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with, optimistically, 10% of our users who will a) enable and b) configure RSBAC then c) use it.  Makes you wonder if it's even worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing to consider here is if, as I was told, we provide the RSBAC tool and RSBAC support in the kernel, but do not enable it out of the box and do not provide default policies, we can only consider ourselves a security technology &lt;i&gt;provider&lt;/i&gt;.  We cannot, by any means, call ourselves a security technology &lt;i&gt;solution&lt;/i&gt;.  Fedora and RH can call themselves a &lt;i&gt;solution&lt;/i&gt; because SELinux is enabled, with default policies, out of the box (although I believe you can turn SELinux support off during install).  Novell can call itself a &lt;i&gt;solution&lt;/i&gt; because AppArmor is running out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can call ourselves a &lt;i&gt;provider&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;enabler&lt;/i&gt;, nothing more.  Which looks rather sad compared to the security &lt;i&gt;solutions&lt;/i&gt; out there.  In fact, I was told that putting RSBAC into the kernel was a "value added service" (in the context of not having any default policies or "out-of-the-box"-ness to go with it).  I don't believe this is true at all.  There is no value to something that such a minority (the optimistic 10%) will use, but which we will have to maintain.  There is no value to pre-packaged rsbac-admin tools that are useless by themself.  Until I argued against it, the SELinux tools were provided in cooker with no SELinux support in the kernel.  This is like that.. we might as well say that providing the SELinux libraries and user-space tools is "value added" because the user only has to patch and recompile the kernel and not compile the userspace tools.  Unless the definition of "value added" has changed recently, this isn't it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I've got RSBAC and AppArmor running together here.  I've got the AppArmor packages Annvix-ized (which means it would take me 5 minutes to adapt them for Mandriva).  The kernel team could probably apply the AppArmor patches, in conjunction with the RSBAC patches, fairly easily.  Default AppArmor policies could be generated for most important apps in a matter of days (and by important I'm talking about servers (forward-facing apps) and networking clients, such as web browsers, email clients... things that could potentially be abused by malicious remote servers).  I suspect the AppArmor tool would take half the amount of time to write than the equivalent RSBAC tool (nevermind the other backend/supporting tools also required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it really that difficult to believe that AppArmor could be fully deployed in cooker within 2 weeks?  Whereas we'd be &lt;i&gt;lucky&lt;/i&gt; to have all the things in place for full RSBAC support within the required 2 months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I've done my part and looked into this.  I'm used to being ignored when it comes to recomendations like this.  I hope this time I'm not.  If I am, however, this will be here for posterity, and if I'm not, well, I'm hoping this could serve as a good roadmap or bitbucket on what challenges would be involved to get full RSBAC support for Corporate Server 5.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT&lt;/b&gt;:  I've been told that we're working on default policies to use with RSBAC, and not necessarily a tool to configure it.  That changes my arguments somewhat about the viability of the out-of-boxness of RSBAC come Mandriva 2007 (if this is true), but then I'm hoping someone writes some good docs so the end user knows how to use the existing CLI tools.  Now, until I can talk to Thierry (I believe he's been on holidays the last week or two), we'll never know for sure whether the plan is for policies and no tool, or a tool and no policies.  Either way, my argument stands.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>So why don't I like the 2.6 kernel anyways?</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/so-why-dont-i-like-the-26-kernel-anyways" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-06-21T00:16:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-06-21T00:16:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-06-21:/blog/so-why-dont-i-like-the-26-kernel-anyways</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of people asking me why, when it comes to my own servers, &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/"&gt;Annvix&lt;/a&gt;, and my own personal recommendations to people who ask what kernel to use, I whole-heartedly do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; recommend the 2.6 kernel and instead advocate the stability and greater security of the 2 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of people asking me why, when it comes to my own servers, &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/"&gt;Annvix&lt;/a&gt;, and my own personal recommendations to people who ask what kernel to use, I whole-heartedly do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; recommend the 2.6 kernel and instead advocate the stability and greater security of the 2.4 kernel.  Well, for kicks I downloaded a CSV file of the entire CVE database from &lt;a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cve/downloads/"&gt;MITRE's CVE downloads page&lt;/a&gt; and did some poking around to determine some metrics.  Note that the CVE database starts in 1999, so it should cover everything from the 2.4 kernel's first release until today, and, of course, the 2.6 kernel to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the results, I had to cull some of the non-linux data, so I grepped for "linux" first, then took that output file and grepped for kernel to get my final dataset to work with, and is a lot more manageable (363k vs. the 12.7MB download file).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here also is with how the CVE names are described.  For instance, it's not easy to determine, by looking at a CVE entry if something that says "SCTP in Linux kernel before 2.6.16.17 bla bla evil thing" means it affects all 2.6 kernels, or if it also affects 2.4 kernels.  I'm leaning towards the former because other entries say things like "The foo function in Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x before 2.6.16 bla bla naughty stuff", which clearly indicates both 2.6 and 2.4 are involved.  I also removed all the external references from each line in the CSV so the line simply contains the CVE name, whether it's an entry or a candidate, and the MITRE description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while these results cannot be considered scientific or probably even closely accurate, let's look at a few things.  The first is the first and last CVE names for a given kernel where their version shows up in the description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.2 - CVE-1999-0804 to CVE-2005-1263 (22 total)
2.4 - CVE-2001-0907 to CVE-2006-2071 (59 total)
2.6 - CVE-2003-0986 to CVE-2006-2629 (132 total)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above was obtained using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
egrep "kernel.*2\.6\." linux-cve.csv|wc -l
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which might not be 100% accurate given some representations are given as simply "kernel 2.6", etc so doing it again using "kernel.*2.6" and so forth gives the folloowing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.2 - 26 total
2.4 - 77 total
2.6 - 154 total&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the variance isn't actually too bad.  For a complete reference, there were 308 total CVE entries from CVE-1999-0216 to CVE-2006-2629 in the file.  Now, if you consider the fact that no mater which number you look at, the number of 2.6-related vulnerabilities is at least twice as high as that of 2.4, that 2.4 hasn't yet been retired so has been "active" for 5 years whereas the 2.6 kernel has only been for 3 years, well, you kinda get the idea of why I don't look too fondly on the 2.6 kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it has some kick-ass features (I, for one, would love to play around with AppArmor), but it also has some severe drawbacks and because I get mailings multiple times a day from MITRE with new CVE name assignments, and I see so many more 2.6-related stuff than 2.4-related stuff... well, I've got a theory and some people will dislike it, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until kernel development branches to 2.7 and the 2.6 kernel is left the hell alone, it will continue to suck, continue to have security issues introduced everytime you turn around (folks, most of these vulnerabilities are being &lt;i&gt;introduced&lt;/i&gt; during the 2.6 lifetime!  This isn't old stuff!), you find more security holes.  Frankly, I feel bad for the Mandriva kernel maintainer (sorry Luiz, you have a shit job having to deal with this).  I feel for all vendors who have to support the 2.6 kernel.  I'm quite happy that Annvix is using the 2.4 kernel and, although we plan to include 2.6 in some fashion for the next release, I promise you that the 2.6 kernel will never be the default until they stop dicking around with it and move on to 2.7 to change APIs and goof off with neat new things, and leave the 2.6 series to stabilize.  This crap about vendors picking and maintaining a 2.6 "sub-branch"(?) like 2.6.15 or 2.6.16 and going from there is crap.  If you're going to do that, you might as well move on and branch to 2.7 and leave 2.6 in 100% maintenance mode, like your happy, friendly, stable, and much less insecure 2.4 friend is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I dislike the 2.6 kernel so much.  I think the whole change of development style from 2.4 to 2.6 completely butchered the stability of the kernel, and the security.  Yup, I will probably get flamed like mad for this, but the stats don't lie (perhaps just the interrpetation of them, but I can't see how you can interpret that in a "nice" light).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I would much rather have used MITRE's search tool on their website, but the search results were coming up with 20-something results when searching for 2.4 &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; 2.6 and I know that's wrong... our last few Mandriva updates have had 20 CVE names in a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; advisory so I know that's not right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, there... now if someone asks me (again) why I don't like the 2.6 kernel, I can point them here.  And if someone feels like going through the CVE names with a little more accuracy in mind (I'm happy with generalizations) please feel free and let me know the specifics.  It's almost 1:00am here and I just don't have the time, desire, or patience to be anal... err... completely 100% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Proprietary ATI and fresh install of Mandriva 2006/x86_64</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/proprietary-ati-and-fresh-install-of-mandriva-2006x86_64" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-06-14T11:27:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-06-14T11:27:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-06-14:/blog/proprietary-ati-and-fresh-install-of-mandriva-2006x86_64</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have this shiny new HP media PC to play with (well, setup really) and I installed Mandriva 2006/x86_64 on it last night and was somewhat disappointed with how it turned out.

The big issue was with the proprietary ATI drivers which, to my amazement, weren't in commercial Club repositories.  This is a fairly significant problem because our upgraded xorg-x11 requires these new drivers (I discovered this after --auto-selecting from the updates medium and X stopped working).  This morning I find there are no new drivers in Club.  Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So wandering over to &lt;a href="https://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894&amp;task=knowledge&amp;folderID=300"&gt;ATI's download page&lt;/a&gt; found me the latest drivers in a nice installer form.  Download the ATI Driver Installer and go to town... it actually works quite well.  With it, you can create Mandriva rpms by following the little dialogs that seem to be 100% compatible (I installed the powerpack DVD so it had the old proprietary drivers and using this, the packages were made and I could just "rpm -Fvh" the resulting rpm packages).  Yes!  X works again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a heck of a time setting up my urpmi sources last night tho... looks like mDNSResponder is being stupid... ftp was complaining about no buffer space being left, but lynx worked (anything using FTP, btw... so that was the ftp client and curl).  Disabling mDNSResponder allowed me to get my urpmi sources setup.  Strange... I don't recall seeing this before but this was one of the few times I didn't really fiddle with the install and disable a bunch of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other issue is a long-standing one with 2006/x86_64 community and some broken KDE/QT packages.  This has been a problem for months, I've reported it on numerous occassions (because I've seen it on my x86_64 laptop) and it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; isn't fixed.The problem is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@media ~]# urpmi --media community --auto-select
Some package requested cannot be installed:
foomatic-db-3.0.2-1.20060227.0.1.20060mdk.noarch
Continue? (Y/n) 
The following packages have to be removed for others to be upgraded:
libarts1-1.4.2-2mdk.i586 (due to missing libqt-mt.so.3)
libkdecore4-3.4.2-31.3.20060mdk.i586 (due to missing libqt-mt.so.3, due to 
  unsatisfied libqt3 &gt;= 3.2.2, due to missing libartsflow.so.1, due to missing 
  libartsflow_idl.so.1, due to missing libkmedia2_idl.so.1, due to missing libmcop.so.1, 
  due to missing libqtmcop.so.1, due to missing libsoundserver_idl.so.1)
libqt3-3.3.4-23mdk.i586 (due to unsatisfied qt3-common == 3.3.4-23mdk)
mindawn-1.3.050824-050916mdk.i586 (due to missing libqt-mt.so.3)
skype-1.2.0.17-1mdk.i586 (due to missing libqt-mt.so.3)
x86-compat-galaxy-kde-1.0.2-19mdk.x86_64 (due to missing libkdefx.so.4) (y/N) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umm... this sucks and is a major nuisance because it gets in the way of everything else in community from getting upgraded other than urpmi and glibc.  Of course, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don't need any of this, but the fellow who's picking up this computer might (I'm sure he might like to play with skype).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is all KDE/QT-related stuff which strengthens my notion that KDE sucks.  Oh, and that x86_64 is a second-rate citizen.  Has &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; else seen this?  If I elect to remove those packages (hit "y" instead of "n"), I get a whole whack of packages to update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is a default 2006/x86_64 powerpack DVD install.  I removed a few thinks, like kdegraphics-kprintfax or whatever, stuff like kopete I removed, but for the most part I left things well enough alone and this is the thanks I get.  Bad community repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I guess he doesn't get to play with skype after all... I can't leave the machine in a half-baked state so off we go.  &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mounting remote systems via ssh</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/mounting-remote-systems-via-ssh" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-06-09T17:50:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-06-09T17:50:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-06-09:/blog/mounting-remote-systems-via-ssh</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I write these little things called TechMails for &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/"&gt;TechRepublic&lt;/a&gt; every month and this month I was looking at Konqueror and it's fish:// Kioslave stuff.

I've never actually played with fish before, probably because I don't really like KDE and never use it but this stuff is pretty neat.  I have no idea if GNOME/Nautilus can do this too (I hope so!), but if not I know I can use stuff like sshfs which is pretty cool too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thinking about my use of OS X on the desktop, I did a half-hearted poke to see if anything like that existed for OS X.  I don't expect to see the Finder allow me to mount remote systems via sftp or anything (although it would be really cool if it did), but I can't seem to find anything that would let me do that, which is disappointing.  About the closest I can get is BBEdit's support for opening FTP/SFTP locations for file editing.  That is handy, definitely, but navigating the remote "filesystem" in BBEdit's open file dialog is less than... nice.  Not only that, but I like Konq's preview and whatnot capabilities with fish://.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's to hoping that someone at Apple, or one of the other fine developers for OS X, think about implementing a filesystem browser or something for OS X that works kinda like the fish KIOslave.  Maybe the fine folks at CocoaTech who make the excellent Path Finder app (a Finder replacement) could implement something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cool as this is, it sure won't make me use KDE day to day, especially seeing as how easy sshfs is to setup and use.  KDE's fish:// support is great as a proof-of-concept, but if it means using KDE to use it, I'll wait for another implementation.  =)  Sorry, but I can't stand KDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised tho, that more people/programs don't have support like this especially considering that ssh/sftp are so commonplace now.  I see a lot of FTP clients with this support, but no real filesystem "navigators".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, I'd even use Konqueror under GNOME if I didn't think it'd make my eyes bleed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Abusive mailing lists</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/abusive-mailing-lists" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-04-26T17:13:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-04-26T17:13:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-04-26:/blog/abusive-mailing-lists</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find it amusing that so many people "new" to Linux and other open source programs think we're all a bunch of arrogant, caffeine-strung, egomaniacs.

I've been lightly reading (and laughing about) a thread on the exim mailing list entitled "Why is this list so abusive?" because some people are getting answers like RTFM.  Now, granted, exim can be a fairly daunting MTA.. it's configurable up the whazoo and the documentation is hefty.  But the documentation is, unlike many other programs, stellar.  You won't find more comprehensive and well-written documentation than the exim manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone pointed out the following "paper" from Eric Raymond: &lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"&gt;How to ask questions the smart way&lt;/a&gt;.  I think everyone who posts on any OSS mailing list should read this.  Some of it is amusing, and some of it is downright logical.  I also think that everyone posting on an OSS mailing list needs to grow some thicker skin because, inevitably, you're going to catch people who are busy, people who are grumpy and, yes, people who are egomaniacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, first and foremost, remember that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are asking people for help.  You're not paying for support, you're not entitled to support because you're using someone's free software, and you certainly can't demand it.  If someone doesn't feel like helping you, don't feel bad... just think about how many times someone has asked for help of you and you never gave it or think of the people asking for help on lists that you're on and you just couldn't be bothered to take the time.  People on these mailing lists have lives and families too and, believe it or not, there is some rationale in wanting to spend time &lt;i&gt;coding&lt;/i&gt; the software in question than just fielding questions regarding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and yes, RTFM before you ask questions because doing otherwise makes you look stupid and lazy.  Sorry, but it's true.  Sometimes the old addage can be adapted.  Instead of "God helps those who help themselves" we should maybe say that "Geeks help those who help themselves".  If you've illustrated that you've actually &lt;i&gt;tried&lt;/i&gt; to find a fix, someone will be more likely to help you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Annvix blog</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/annvix-blog" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-03-30T10:51:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-03-30T10:51:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-03-30:/blog/annvix-blog</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I moved all the Annvix-related blog entries to the new &lt;a href="http://blog.annvix.org/"&gt;Annvix Developer's Blog&lt;/a&gt; since I'm "consolidating" all Annvix-related stuff there.

So, since then I've been putting info on security updates we work on into a FileMaker database (yeah yeah, I know... the zealots out there will crucify me for using commercial software but... it works and saves me tonnes of time... find me something as good on Linux and I'll look at it (FM works on OS X and Windows only, more's the shame)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I just finished inputting the last bit of data from last year's advisories which was a manual process because the data I wanted to put into the database wasn't all in one place, or even could be consistently retrieved.. I'm sure I could write a script to do it, but it probably would have taken twice as long.  But some interesting stuff has come out of this little database now that I can look at certain trends.  I'll have to make some reports and such to really do some more interesting things with the info, but from a flat "here's a list ordered by MDKSA/MDKA id" I can see certain things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, we're almost spot on where we were last year in terms of advisories.  Last year at this time we had reached MDKSA-2005:061 and last week we put up MDKSA-2006:060 (now, this doesn't take into account non-security MDKA advisories or "-1" advisories).  I actually thought we were busier this year than last, and I think we were, but things have been not quite as hectic the last 2-3 weeks (which is wierd... I'm waiting for something like zlib to nail us again); if the trend had continue we were on, we would have put out MDKSA-2006:075 (or higher) last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also interesting to see how quick the turn-around is from when we start working on an advisory to when we have it out.  There are, obviously, some exceptions to the rule based on external circumstances such as agreed-upon embargos for non-public advisories, work being done by another team (ie. Fred Crozat (God bless him) typically does all our Mozilla updates and the kernel team does the kernel updates), etc.  Sometimes we've begun working on something, tested it, etc. only to find through peer review that a patch is insufficient or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it looks like the average time to handle an update from start to finish is 3-4 days, which I don't think is bad at all considering the "multiples" we have to deal with; ie. one advisory in, say, apache, might affect all platforms for which we may be actively supporting 5 different distributions on two different architectures meaning there are 10 different tests that need to be performed.  This also includes the time to build and patch updates (but doesn't include research time as this info is based on when we actually start &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; an update).  Our longest update was 79 days which, when I look at it now, is absolutely astounding.  Of course, this was from the old kernel maintainer (and it was for the kernel) and our process in place now is much much better.  In fact, I believe that update could very well have been one of the contributing factors to his being.... dismissed.  Kernels definitely don't take that long anymore.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other interesting data (and I only went back to incorporate all of 2005 in this database... no way I'm going back further):  there are 398 records in the database, so 398 updates since Jan 1, 2005, or in the last 15 months.  That works out to being 26.5 updates/month, or 1.325 updates/day (assuming on average 20 working days in a month).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually extremely impressed by that.  I didn't realize Stew and I worked that hard.  =)  I may have more interesting statistics available in the future... now that I have the data in the database I can actually work with it and make it do something useful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Subversion, MediaWiki, and Bugzilla</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/subversion-mediawiki-and-bugzilla" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-03-25T01:30:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-03-25T01:30:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-03-25:/blog/subversion-mediawiki-and-bugzilla</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Found this fantastic article about &lt;a href="http://oss.segetech.com/bugzilla-svn-wiki.html"&gt;how to setup Subversion, MediaWiki, and Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt; to be nicely integrated.

Yeah, the tools were ok and nothing much different from what I use except for some of the desktop-ish stuff he uses.  What got me though was the first &lt;a href="http://www.linux.com/comments.pl?sid=36338&amp;cid=87337"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; that was made.  Vim has text folding?  I had no idea.  That totally rocks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I appreciate about the two IDE's I use (Komodo and Zend Studio, although Komodo does this one thing nicer) is code folding.  I love being able to fold code and get it out of the way.  The fact that I can do this in vim, with &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; is really really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick step by step here to get the basics (use ":help folding" to get a really large rundown on all the stuff you can do):  Use "V" to visually highlight the lines you want to fold (this is in command mode, BTW) then use "zf" to fold them into one line (the "z*" commands seem to be relevant just for folding).  You'll get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
+----  8 lines: if ( $wgCommandLineMode ) {--------
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use "zo" to open the fold, which just expands it.  You can then use "zc" to close the fold again (good for quick peeks), without having to re-highlight the block.  As well, just about anything you do on the line that is the fold marker (as shown above) will expand it... ie. hitting "$" to get to the end of the line will do it, hitting the right arrow will do it, etc.  The nice thing is you can "zc" the fold while you're anywhere in the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really need to use vim more and remember all the bloody commands.  I've been using joe for so long that, although I can use vim quite well, I don't have it customized enough and can never remember simple commands like page-up/down, etc.  Maybe I should remove joe from everything and force myself to use vim (I did that with OS/2 when I first started learning Linux and look at me now!)&lt;/p&gt;

Both Red Hat and Novell offer enterprise class Linux distributions. “Rather than working with the open-source community [on SELinux], Novell has thrown out its own competing version.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh?  Are you trying to tell me that SELinux was the only MAC software for Linux?  Maybe you're trying to tell me it's the best.  In my opinion, neither is true.To understand my point of view, you need to understand that I don't like LSM (the Linux Security Modules) which is what stuff like AppArmor and SELinux take advantage of (and for this reason, I'm not too hugely keen on AppArmor either).  To explain why, just read this from the RSBAC site on &lt;a href="http://www.rsbac.org/documentation/why_rsbac_does_not_use_lsm"&gt;Why RSBAC does not use LSM&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm inclined to agree with a lot of their points.  From the day LSM was born I was leary of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, what Red Hat (and journalists, apparently) seem to miss is that there are a lot more MAC-ish software out there, including RSBAC, GRsecurity, LIDS, and others (I think LIDS is still around... the last time I played with it was around the Mandrake 8.1 days and I loved running it, but it was too much for me to maintain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they also don't get is that while SELinux is difficult to configure, it's also way too intrusive.  The kernel stuff might be fairly simplistic due to LSM, but it has to go out and touch user-land apps too.  MAC protection is great, but when I have to have specific patches in PAM, util-linux, etc. in order to make it work in the first place, all of a sudden I've lost my interest.  I shouldn't have to patch userland tools to run this stuff.  With RSBAC, you don't have to.  I'm pretty sure with AppArmor you don't either.  That's another reason I dislike SELinux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELinux isn't the be-all and end-all and while it might be great for military setups, the end-user shouldn't have to deal with the headache.  I've read some of the implementation notes of AppArmor and find it much more suitable for the average joe than SELinux and, frankly, I'm glad Novell is going that route.  Maybe it'll make the SELinux guys look at making it a little easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you have other idiots that completely don't understand things.  Dan Walsh seems to think that Linux is going to fragment over this and we'll have another &lt;a href="http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/2006/02/09/"&gt;UNIX wars&lt;/a&gt; over this.  Folks, SELinux wasn't the first MAC implementation, and it's probably not the best either.  Remember, choice is good and alternatives rock.  Did you dis Firefox when it came out, thinking it was the browser wars all over again?  And if it was, so what?  Maybe all the attention Firefox is getting will make IE7 better (I doubt it, but hey, you never know).  If the Mozilla folks decided that they didn't want to step on any toes, Firefox would have gone nowhere.  We wouldn't have Seamonkey now.  Maybe we shouldn't have supported the creation of the Evolution email client because it might have competed unfairly with Mozilla Mail?  Maybe the guys who developed Ruby should have sat back and decided to work on Python, PHP, or Perl in order to not fragment the scripting/development communities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is good.  New, competing software is good.  It weeds out the crap.  Maybe Novell disagreed with how SELinux worked and saw changing it to suit their vision as too much work or too much of an uphill battle, fighting with SELinux authors and maintainers.  Maybe they'll looked at Immunix's stuff and went "hey, that's what we like".  Remember, AppArmor wasn't recently developed; it came along with the Immunix staff and their other technology.  So this isn't a "new" thing.  They've just made it more publically available, they've given us choice.  It's not proprietary, it's not a lock-in (anyone who can recompile a kernel can use it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the other thing I find amusing is that Dan Walsh, who is bemoaning AppArmor and berating Novell for not contributing money and effort to SELinux is working on it himself: &lt;i&gt;"Three years ago, I was asked to work on the SELinux Team at Red Hat to bring Mandatory Access Control to a mainstream operating system (OS)."&lt;/i&gt;  This isn't a neutral third-party.  Think about that.  Of course Red Hat is going to complain about AppArmor; they have a financial stake in SELinux after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I'd rather avoid both altogether, just because I don't like LSM.  Give me RSBAC any day.  It's just as hard as SELinux, has all the stuff in it you want, been around forever, and doesn't use LSM.  The SELinux junkies should love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same arguments folks make about AppArmor over SELinux could easily be made about SELinux over RSBAC.  End goals and implementation designs are the mitigating factors here and apparently Novell prefers the simplicty of AppArmor over SELinux.  For a guy who's briefly played with SELinux, I don't blame them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, because Mandriva is using the 2.6 kernel, we may want to look at AppArmor as opposed to RSBAC.  For Annvix, I'm sticking with RSBAC because I can use it on both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels (which is important since Annvix still uses a 2.4 kernel).  Since Mandriva 2006, we've not had a 2.4 kernel even as a supported alternative, so we can pretty much use whatever we like (although, from a selfish standpoint, I'd rather Mandriva uses RSBAC too).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>How I love thee RAID1</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/how-i-love-thee-raid1" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-02-15T23:11:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-02-15T23:11:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-02-15:/blog/how-i-love-thee-raid1</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, having a RAID1 setup on this server has saved my a$$ in a huge way.

Yesterday I started getting notifications of a smart failure on one of the drives (I have two configured as a RAID1 across a few partitions).  So I went down to the colo to swap the drive (after finding a spare here and testing the heck out of it first).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, wouldn't you know but the drive I pulled, while having some issues (they weren't overly severe, just being unable to read some blocks), wasn't the one with the real problems.  After replacing the drive and getting the first three partitions sync'd up (the smallest) I came back home expecting to login, check the status of the final sync, and carry on with my night.  Well, get home and I can ping the machine but it's not serving any data.  Drive back to the colo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the other drive is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dying.  Good thing I brought everything from the first trip back (my tools, etc.) so I could put the drive I had just pulled out back in and take the other one out.  Fortunately, the data problems weren't across the first threee (system) partitions (/boot, /, and /usr/local), but the partition containing all my web/mail files didn't finish syncing due to all the problems.  So after booting up with the original drive (and my new drive), I didn't have a /dev/md3 because it failed utterly the last few times.  Had to re-assemble that array from the original drive, then hot-add the new drive to it, to get the data back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my 20 minute job ended up taking about 5 hours to figure out.  &lt;sigh&gt;  But wouldn't you know it, when I got back home just now, I did an rsync across from my other server (which does a daily rsync) and the changed files were what I expected.  I didn't lose a single file.  I'm amazed; I thought for sure I would have lost nearly a day's worth of mail archives and stuff (everything else is fairly static with the exception of the SQL database which lives on the / partition which synced up ok).Moral of the story: RAID1 redudancy &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;.  I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the TODO is to have rsync run every four hours, rather than once a day so at the absolute most, all I can lose is 4hrs worth of stuff (this goes for the dumped and sync'd SQL databases as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other TODO (already scheduled for this summer) is to replace the machines I have at the colo with two &lt;a href="http://ca.sun.com/en/catalog/?n-state=http://catalog.sun.com/productinfo.xml?site%3dCANENCA%26catalogue%3dFC%26segment%3dFC_R%26item%3dFC_SC_CAT%26group%3d2010%26fid%3d5118%26id%3d13158%26partnerid%3dcacanen~~~G!01AC4B5F334B!WBPkexcnEpBE33lF~standard~ws-nocache"&gt;Sun x2100 servers&lt;/a&gt;... these little 1U baddies are &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; (and, BTW, Annvix runs peachy on them).  Opteron CPUs, dual gigabit nics (both fully supported), SATA support for two drives (with front-accessible trays no less!)...  I am so getting two of these.  Not only will they nicely replace 6U of servers with just 2U but &lt;b&gt;front-loading trays!&lt;/b&gt;  I won't have to take the machines out of the rack for anything less serious than a motherboard failure.  Sweet machines and reasonably priced too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad they don't have space for a third drive tho... it would be nice to set one drive aside as a spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick notes for those interested in the implementation (and how easy it was to do this, aside from the really dying drive not reporting SMART information to smartd (bad drive!)):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Login and set the partitions of the dying drive to faulty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# mdadm --manage --set-faulty /dev/md0 /dev/hda1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and repeat for all partitions on /dev/hda with all your /dev/mdX devices; in my case I had four: /dev/md[0123])&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, hot-remove the faulty devices from the RAID arrays (need to be marked as faulty first):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# mdadm /dev/md0 -r /dev/hda1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and repeat for all partitions.  Next, bring the machine down (after doing a "cat /proc/mdstat" to make sure they're really down; the arrays will be marked as running in degraded mode with a status of [U_]).  Swap out the drive.  Boot the machine again.  It's really a good idea here to make sure you can boot off of &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; drive (I do this with GRUB and set it up on both drives because here /dev/md0 is /boot, so it's accessible on both machines (as, ie. /dev/hda1 and /dev/hdc1) and then GRUB can boot from either.  This is one reason I much prefer GRUB to lilo as with GRUB I can do this, with LILO I couldn't (maybe you can now, I don't know... I haven't touched LILO in about 2 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, once you're back up and running, re-partition the new drive to match the old drive (making sure the partition types are set to fd for the RAIDed partitions).  Then hot-add them back to the array:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/hda1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What /proc/mdstat or you can use "mdadm --detail /dev/md0" to view progress and other neat info.  The arrays will reconstruct themselves and, unless you have an issue like me, you're good to go.  So, realistically, you're running three mdadm commands with a little hardware swapping in between.  I don't think a 20 minute estimate for downtime was too unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, everything is back up without a problem (knock on wood) so that's nice.  I tell ya tho... front-loading drive trays would have been fantastic.  Serial ATA would have been fantastic too.  Luckily, those servers will only be there for a few more months than they can retire back here and replace an aging LAN server (with some new drives, of course) and maintaining these remote servers should be much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>UNIX Security - don't believe the truth</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/unix-security-dont-believe-the-truth" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-02-06T14:18:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-02-06T14:18:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-02-06:/blog/unix-security-dont-believe-the-truth</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know, almost every single article that I've ever bothered to read on &lt;a href="http://www.osnews.com/"&gt;OSNews&lt;/a&gt; has been pure crap, to put it politely, and I wonder why these idiots haven't gotten a clue yet.

Their latest piece of editorial or user-submitted idiocy is entitled &lt;a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=13568"&gt;UNIX Security - Don't Believe the Truth&lt;/a&gt; where the idiot author is claiming that Linux/OS X security is fantastic because a virus or malware while, being unable to break the entire system, can wipe out the user's home directory and then continues on indicating that the average home user doesn't care about system files but about pictures of little Billy at Christmas with his finger up his nose, which is what makes Linux/OS X &lt;i&gt;just as&lt;/i&gt; secure as Windows and delivers a false sense of security.  Huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the author says, a backup would take care of this but because everyone feels that Linux/OS X is so secure, why do they need a backup?  I quote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Of course, they should make backups-- but wasn't Linux supposed to be secure? So why should they backup? Isn't Linux immune to viruses and what not? Isn't that what the Linux world has been telling them?&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm... excuse me?  Ever heard of a hard drive failure?  Ever heard of your wife deleting your porn collection?  Ever hear of the three year old monkeying around and deleting something by accident?  Backups don't belong to windows in the same vein that anti-virus, anti-spyware, and other malware detection/removal programs do.  Backups existed long before Windows.  Why?  Because, yes, data is important and yes, people accidentally "rm -rf" stuff (I've done it many times).  It's not because we think we need a backup because we're gonna get nailed with some malware.  Apparently this... person... thinks that backups are the sole province of Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiots of the world unite!  It's people like this, who have their constant and irritating Windows vs. Linux crud that really get under my skin because it's essentially a case of the blind leading the blind or the idiots leading the stupid.  OSNews, a site that has never received an ounce of respect from me, really has issues when they let this kind of crud go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the readers seem to have issues too because they all argue the wrong thing (the lack of malware on Linux and OS X) when they should be arguing the fact that only an idiot (yes, that is my favourite word today) would run a computer, pretend to have files that are important to them, and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have a backup of some sort of that data.  Almost every computer now-a-days comes with a CD-RW and/or a DVD+-RW.

Very slick!  Now I can rectify a stupid mistake I made on my Mandriva x86_64 build machine (had 2x250GB drives in there but made them a RAID1 set... now I have 20GB free and all I can think of is how much nicer it would be to have 500GB to store stuff I can either re-download or re-copy from the install CDs/DVDs (it's my repository for every file we've ever put into a distro, and tracking cooker, across two platforms for all currently supported distros, including cooker)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now the big rsync from one machine to the other begins, then I can make an LVM set of the two 250GBs, and then rsync everything back.  Lots of work, but at least I won't have to worry about running out of space anytime soon, and it's especially important with Corp4 coming soon, as well as 2007 (and even though 10.0 will be EOL, I need to keep the packages for help with Corp3, and even though Corp2.1 will be EOL, it takes up very little space so that doesn't save me much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunno why I never played with LVM before... looks like it could be pretty useful if you did LVM over RAID (I'm already thinking of 4x250GB or 6x250GB drives with an LVM over RAID giving me a single 750GB RAID1 partition which would make a kick-ass fileserver).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Linux security... ad nauseum</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/linux-security-ad-nauseum" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-01-05T16:32:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-01-05T16:32:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2006-01-05:/blog/linux-security-ad-nauseum</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know, it really irritates me that almost every single day there is a new "report" or article out about Linux security... and more often than not it's compared to Windows security.

Not only has this topic been beaten to death, stomped on, kicked, buried, dug up, and beaten some more, all of these so-called "experts" and journalists are nothing more than hyping a topic that, quite frankly, is more than boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, these idiots half the time don't even know what they're talking about.  For instance, look at CERT's latest report (which is a load of bung as far as I'm concerned).  The "Cyber Security Bulletin" for 2005 is retarded.  If you haven't seen it yet, you can look at it at &lt;a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/bulletins/SB2005.html"&gt;http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/bulletins/SB2005.html&lt;/a&gt;.  The basic summary is that there were 5198 reported vulns, 812 of which are Windows and 2238 which are Unix/Linux, and another 2058 multiple-OS vulns.  Well, just the summary has issues.  I mean, why does Windows (one OS) get compared against "Unix/Linux" (multiple OS's)?  For instance, I recall some vendor-specific things... like SUSE's YaST had some issues and Gentoo's portage had a few issues as well.  Those all get lumped in together, counting as (in the general totals) one OS.  Then you get stuff from SCO that everyone else fixed in 2004 that they decided to get around to (come on guys... either do it or not but your lame attempt to show you care about security is fooling no one but you), stuff specific to Apple (a vuln in coreaudio on OS X would have nothing to do with any Linux or BSD, etc.).  So now we're comparing really inflated numbers on one hand to, perhaps, moderately inflated numbers on another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20051231142317870"&gt;Groklaw&lt;/a&gt; has taken a short stab at this as well, so I won't go into too many details, suffice it to say that these reports are nothing more than senseless garbage.  They're not coherent, they're not well formulated, and they're just plain old nothing more than a bunch of numbers that mean less than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let's not forget that your average Linux desktop distro has 10-20x more applications bundled with it than Windows does, so of course the number is going to be higher.  Toss in distros that bundle PHP applications (which I never understood, but ok) and that number explodes due to XSS vulns and other similar issues found in a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of PHP apps out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, despite the report being crap, why do people insist on doing the boring old Linux vs. Windows stuff still?  There's nothing new here.  Instead of comparing them on technical merits, functionality, etc. everyone seems to be jumping on the security bandwagon and while I appreciate security is a big thing, it just gets boring to see it over and over and over again.  Do people not have anything better to write about than to conjure up the same old boring &lt;i&gt;blah&lt;/i&gt; that we've been reading about for years?  Come on guys!

The problem was the 64bit version didn't work very well.  And the commercial NX server, although it says it's for i386 and amd64, also has a lot of unresolved dependencies due to it, well, being compiled for 32bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution was to grab packages from the 32bit Mandriva.  I installed libxcomp1, libxcompext1, libnxX11_0, nxagent, nxproxy, libopenssl0.9.7, nxviewer, nxdesktop, and freenx from the 32bit contribs and then proceeded with the normal setup.  Now it works fine and oh wow, does it ever work great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I can tuck the vmware host machine into my rack and use FreeNX to connect to it on my G5, getting rid of another box and monitor from my office and a KVM switch for my keyboard/mouse.  Very very nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick, then, if you want to use FreeNX on a 64bit distro (or, at least, Mandriva) is grab the 32bit packages and supporting libs (in this case libopenssl0.9.7, libxcompext1, and libxcomp1) and it works just peachy.  Much nicer than VNC, and much faster too.  And vmware doesn't give me fits!  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Aaarg! VNC? FreeNX?

I recall doing VNC in the past with 10.1 and LE2005 and it working great, and that was my first move...  but I'll be danged if I could make it work with 2006/x86_64.  My VNC clients on OS X (all three that I tried) wouldn't connect to the machine...  all of them were timing out.  So then I tried installing FreeNX from contribs, got that setup, and was using the NX client from www.nomachine.com.. couldn't make that work either.  I did try getting the NX client running on Windows, and couldn't make it connect either (I didn't try running VNC on Windows, but I don't really care if any of this works on Windows anyways since my primary desktop is running OS X).  I even downloaded the demo version of the commercial NX server and couldn't even get &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; to work on the stinking machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So finally I just did an Xnest call to get my desktop up and running over SSH.  Seemed to work fantastic... gdm came up after I loosened some security I normally tighten, vmware came up, I could get into the vmware machines and type fine... but the stupid "e" key was acting like a backspace key!  WTF?!?  Ummm... unfortunately, my last name has an "e" in it so it's a little difficult to login (I had to use a gdm theme with a chooser just to get into the bloody desktop).  So even though, with that, I could log into my desktop, fire up vmware, and use it, when I tried to switch vc's in a vmware machine and log in, I wasn't able to because I couldn't type the letter "e".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I'm having a really stupid day today, or if something in my 2006/x86_64 install is severely hooped (or maybe in the case of the Xnest/VNC stuff it's all the OS X VNC clients/X server that's hooped... will try with my other 2006/x86_64 install tomorrow), but I am getting severely annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeNX sure sounds cool, but it sure would be cooler if I could actually get it to work.  Wierd and cryptic errors, even with debug logging the server doesn't tell me much and the client seems to think the server is booting it, but the server doesn't indicate why.  Aaaargh!  Could I possibly find a better way to waste a day?!?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>My take on Ubuntu</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/my-take-on-ubuntu" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-11-29T17:04:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-11-29T17:04:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-11-29:/blog/my-take-on-ubuntu</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everytime I turn around I'm hearing someone say how good Ubuntu is.

I've never tried it before today so I figured I'd give it a go and check it out.  My first comment: not a big fan of brown.  I'm not an "earthy" kinda guy (nevermind that my first character in any MMoRPG is a druid).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuration was straightforward.  Couldn't configure the wireless card during install, but no big deal.  Text-based installers I'm cool with... after all, this one is easier than the Annvix installer.  =)  People who say the Ubuntu installer is faster are smoking crack... it's just as slow as everything else (or as fast, depending on your hardware I guess).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that I've not really looked at any Linux distros in a few years...  I upgrade every Mandriva release on my laptop and desktop machines, but otherwise I'm using OS X for my desktop so I'm not so "bleeding edge" or even really up to speed with a lot of the new stuff that comes out for desktop Linux...  I more concentrate on the server stuff where Linux is concerned.  I played with SUSE 9.3 on this libretto after Mandriva LE2005 seemed less than satisfying, but it was worse so I only really looked at it for an hour or two before going back to Mandriva.  This is the first Linux distro other than Mandriva that I've actually spent some time poking around with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I like is synaptic.  I like this much better than rpmdrake.  It's crisp, clean, easy to understand, and very professional looking.  I like it a lot.  rpmdrake should either be remodelled to look/feel more like this; I think it's stellar.  Not sure how well it works with urpmi or even rpm, but I understand it's in Mandriva somewhere (never used it before today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I like is the online update notifier thing.  I realize mdkonline is similar, but I think Mandriva could learn from this...  not only was it easy and painfree, but a little bulb pops up on the menu bar that indicates there is a task to be done (once the updates were installed).  Then you get a popup window saying the linux kernel had been updated and the user is recommended to reboot immediately.  That's actually kinda freaky... other than Windows and OS X, I've never been told to reboot after an update... but for a kernel, it makes sense.  A little touch, but I thought it kinda neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that really made me want to look at Ubuntu was the fact that it's GNOME-based, and that it comes with version 2.12.1 rather than 2.10 which Mandriva comes with.  I'm not keen on waiting a year to get to play with 2.12, and I don't have time to muck with cooker.  I also like the fact that it comes without KDE... yippee!  That's a load of crap I don't need (sorry to all the KDE folk out there, but I haven't liked KDE since 1.x and I still don't like it).  GNOME is much more refined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like the fact that everything runs through sudo.  I love sudo.  I think sudo is the best thing since sliced bread, aside from openssh.  I love that I only have to type my password to get into administrative stuff rather than the root password... my root passwords are so long and cryptic that I usually don't use them... unless I need to administrate something on a Mandriva box with the Mandriva tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I also noticed which was kinda neat is that Ubuntu properly shows the CPU frequency of this machine.  On Mandriva, it was always showing 1GHz, but with Ubuntu, I can see it scale between 598MHz (seems to be the default) up to 1GHz (rarely).  Not a major thing, but kinda neat.  The one thing that concerns me is that the gkrellm temperature sensor says this little guy is running at 72C.  Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whoah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  One of the problems I had with Mandriva 2006 (and LE2005 before it) on this machine was that I was unable to suspend the laptop.  When I did, it would suspend ok, but crap out on startup or just boot the machine like normal.  In fact, I don't recall ever having a suspend work on anything other than a mac.  Maybe just my luck, but half the time it wouldn't even work properly with Windows.  Well, blow me over, but my first attempt at suspending Ubuntu worked.  I'll be danged.  Even the networking came back properly.  Now I'm going to try hibernating (hmm... can you tell that I'm writing as I fiddle with this thing?).  Hibernating worked good too... came up ok, networking came back too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never could tell the difference between suspend and hibernate before (likely because neither ever worked for me), but I can see it now... suspend brings you back quicker to the OS (probably stored in memory or something) whereas hibernate seems to write to the disk because when I turned the machine back on, it booted up; I selected the kernel I was using from grub and up she went.  Good, perhaps, if you need to boot into Windows or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is extremely irritating.  Now the fricking machine is making this continous beep and won't shut up.  Holy crap that's annoying.  Dunno why it did that.. maybe due to the hibernate?  It started about 3 minutes after resuming from the hibernation.  Whatever it was, I had to power down to make it stop.  Bad bad bad.  I'd rather have it not work than do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to play with it some more to see if it was actually the hibernation that caused that beep or something else (the rest of the desktop felt sluggish too, so maybe hibernating isn't quite there yet although it's further here than it is in Mandriva (at least on this machine)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'll keep Ubuntu on this machine for a bit... seems like a cute little distro although the first thing I changed was the "Human" theme... ick.  Not my style.  Also, installing the other repositories (multiverse and something else... machine is off now so I can't check... universe maybe?) are a good idea to add.  That's the only way I could get gkrellm on there, although I miss the gkrellm-themes package from Mandriva... what's wrong with these people?  How hard is it to package a few wee themes for gkrellm?!?  The stock skin is so... ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it's not bad.  I don't think it's the most user-friendly distro out there... I think Mandriva has it beat hands-down on user-friendliness, but I do think it has a few things that deserve some prodding... things that could make Mandriva better.  I'll be the first to admit that 2006 is probably one of the most professional looking/feeling versions we've put out in a while...  the cracked out Tux in LE2005 was a serious disappointment.  But it could certainly do with more refining... and Ubuntu looks like they've done a bit to make it feel refined.  Of course, that could be the fact that it's GNOME and GNOME is just so much more polished than KDE (which we put too much focus on and, I think, doesn't work half as good as GNOME).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I stumble across anything else of interest, I'll post it.  For what it's worth, as far as the hardware support goes, Ubuntu is just as good as Mandriva... better when it came to configuring X... it got the resolution and everything correct without me having to do a thing, which is cool.  Otherwise, I'm still waiting for someone to support this SD card reader built into this thing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>New Mandriva Community Wiki ... and my eyes are burning</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/new-mandriva-community-wiki-and-my-eyes-are-burning" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-11-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-11-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-11-15:/blog/new-mandriva-community-wiki-and-my-eyes-are-burning</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I should have been doing other work today, but there was nothing super urgent so I decided to dedicate the day to converting content from the old TWiki-based Mandriva Community Wiki over to the new system (using MediaWiki).

What an utterly &lt;b&gt;boring&lt;/b&gt; job.  Dries out the eyes too.  Let's see... from about 9am to 11pm I've been working on the site... less 2hrs to watch The Empire Strikes Back and 1hr to play some World of Warcraft (gotta give them eyes a break from all that copy-paste-re-format).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good lord what an immense job that was.  And what a mess that wiki was!  Pages with 3 lines of text on it??  What?!?  You gotta be kidding me.  That's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; good organization there.  Makes it harder than necessary to use.  So it was a matter of re-organization to make things more logical, combining pages that should have been single pages in the first place, and then adding a bit of style to make things stand out more.  Of course, each page still has to be re-checked and not everything is imported but, honestly... 11hrs of working on that thing is more than enough.  Time for the community to take the reigns and finish it off (although I may lend a hand yet).  Might do some more tomorrow, once I build those PHP updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the new site is up and I think it looks good.  &lt;a href="http://mandriva.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;http://mandriva.vmlinuz.ca/&lt;/a&gt; is the URL.  It's certainly faster than TWiki.  I'll take PHP-based over Perl-based anyday.  And once I throw mcache support in there, it should be even faster since it should cut down database hits by about 90% or more (which is always a good thing).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>64bit guest emulation... enter QEMU</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/64bit-guest-emulation-enter-qemu" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-11-08T09:57:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-11-08T09:57:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-11-08:/blog/64bit-guest-emulation-enter-qemu</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I have a definite need to have virtual machine support for 64bit guests so imagine how pleased I was when vmware indicated that the new version of workstation (5.5.0) would have support for 64bit guests.

Fantastic!  Then, reading the fine print, discovered that I would need to buy a new CPU (won't work with older AMD64 CPUs) and then a new motherboard to go with it, and the extras... new RAM and probably a new video card.  Unimpressed, I'm looking at an alternative called QEMU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QEMU virtualizes a lot more than just a 32bit PC; it can also emulate x86_64, sparc, ppc, and a few others I think.  My only real interest is in virtualizing x86_64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, nice as that sounds in theory (and most of the people I've talked to use it to virtualize a 32bit OS... something I'm not interested in because vmware does that quite nicely).  Well, trying to load Mandriva 2006/x86_64 in QEMU is a bit of a bummer... not only does lilo and grub both segfault, but I can't get past the bloody bootloader during install!  So three times I've tried now and three times I've been unable to complete the installation.  Not happy in the slightest.  I remember older Mandrake releases would let you skip past stuff, but apparently not anymore (bad idea, in my opinion... we need a "skip" button on some stuff like crashing bootloaders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying with LE2005 now...  if I can get most of the supported distros running in QEMU, that just means one less distro to chroot for security testing.&lt;/p&gt;

It was quite a surprise this morning when I was reading through my daily logging reports and found that I had a process spring up since yesterday's report telling me that a program named ./r0nin was newly listening to port 1666 on one of my web servers.  So aside went the mozilla testing to take a peek as this is a client webserver and, well, I don't take kindly to tampering of any sort.  Besides, it's been a while since I put my forensic skills to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me give you the lowdown and if nothing else, it'll serve as a reminder to me who, thankfully, has only had to do this once before (damn phpNuke!).  Now it's damn a lazy client who decided running WordPress 1.3alpha2 was a good idea, especially considering all the xmlrpc noise that's been made lately.  How's that for a quick summary?  Read on for the goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first notice was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Security Warning: There are modifications for port listening on your machine :
                -  Opened ports : tcp        0      0 *:1666                  *:*                     LISTEN      24465/r0nin
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that sure didn't look good.  So I examined the other email reports (these are coming from rsec, the baby-brother of msec designed for Annvix).  The other reports didn't bring to light anything of interest.  My tripwire report showed nothing had changed within the last 24hrs of the stuff I monitor (which doesn't include the web roots, which I may change).  So at least no binaries had been tampered with, which is a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to find r0nin on that machine.  A quick &lt;b&gt;find / -name r0nin&lt;/b&gt; found it in the web root of one of my client's websites.  Now, this client runs a lot of different packages... geeklog, gallery, and wordpress; probably a few other things I didn't immediately notice.  Anyways, in the webroot was r0nin, w00t, uselib24, and dc.txt.  The first three were executables, the last a perl script which identifies itself as "Data Cha0s Connect Back Backdoor".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I know which site is at fault... I have the timestamps of the files indicating they were placed there or modified at 15:00, 15:06, 15:05, and 15:05 respectively (all on Sep 25).  Time to scrub some logfiles.  Doing some manual "surfing" of the logfiles showed me the following entries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:14:59:44 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 61 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:14:59:48 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 2696 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:14:59:56 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 110 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:15:00:20 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 13 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:15:00:25 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 1145 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:15:00:36 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 65 "-" "-"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting.  WordPress has had a recent share of XMLRPC issues so this looked very suspicious, and it hit my timeframe.  Grepping in the wp/ directory showed me that the version was 1.3-alpha-2.  Looking at the website, 1.5.2 is out so I knew right there that the xmlrpc vulns were the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to determine whether the executables were compiled on the system or whether they were just uploaded.  Unfortunately, with the xmlrpc server, nothing got logged so I had no idea what they did through it.  But doing some grepping and strings on the binary showed me they were not built with SSP protection, which indicated they were not compiled on my system.  Great news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I've determined they got to upload their backdoor files via WordPress' xmlrpc vulns.  The files are owned by apache, and a &lt;b&gt;ps axu&lt;/b&gt; showed me that r0nin was running as user apache.  Didn't look like they obtained root this way, so this was a bit of a bootstrap.  Obviously r0nin is some daemon to spawn a shell, probably as user apache, on the system.  Note to self: see if apache can happily run with a shell set to /bin/false rather than /bin/sh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't too concerned when I saw r0nin listening on port 1666... showed me it wasn't a priv port (good), and I also firewall the snot our of my servers... I have rules in place to limit inbound &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; outbound traffic; ie. that machine can't even open an FTP connection to the outside world.  So I was pretty confident they wouldn't get in that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grepping my kernel logfiles proved me right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Sep 25 15:00:47 host kernel: Shorewall:net2all:DROP:IN=eth0 OUT= \
  MAC=00:50:ba:42:f7:0e:00:0d:bd:81:90:41:08:00 SRC=200.164.102.51 \
  DST=[my_ip] LEN=48 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=111 ID=5968 DF PROTO=TCP \
  SPT=1379 DPT=1666 WINDOW=64800 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There were three attempts within a minute of each other... wrapped manually so as not to screw up the viewing output).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same timeframe, same IP adress, and the destination port (DPT) was 1666, the port r0nin was listening to.  Thank you, Shorewall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there was nothing else logged, and nothing else suspicious, I figure the script kiddy moved on after he realized he wasn't getting in.  Poor boy.  After looking at all of this and determining that he didn't get anywhere beyond the "bootstrap" phaze of the attack, I thought I'd take a look at w00t.  I assumed, just due to the name, that it was the exploit that would yield root.  Google didn't really bring anything up, although I didn't expect it would since "w00t" is such an elite term.  You know... 3r33t and /|ll that (yes, I used to run a hacker bbs and know all the lingo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I figured, what the hell, I'll run it (as user apache, on a separate test machine, also running Annvix).  Yup.  It's a rootkit.  Nice thing is, it didn't work.  =)  strace doesn't show anything particular; lots of segfaults.  It's definitely trying to exploit the kernel, however, as it gives this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what any of that means, but I'm suspecting another kernel issue.  Oh well.  [&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; this kernel exploit is fairly old, the source can be found on &lt;a href="http://packetstormsecurity.org/0501-exploits/uselib24.c"&gt;packetstorm&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough fun, time to clean this junk up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line?  Use a good fixed kernel (either a patched one from your vendor or the latest kernel.org kernel).  I'm not liking the 2.6 kernel for servers yet, so I'm using 2.4.31 with the openwall kernel patches.  Make sure your web apps are up to date; until the client fixes his wordpress install, I've set a apache deny clause to that directory so it can't be used as an attack vector anymore.  And firewalls that not only prevent incoming traffic but also outgoing are a good thing.  Remember, default DENY and selectively ACCEPT.  To DENY particular ports is pointless, if I had done that, the intruder would have gotten in (I have no reason to explicitly firewall port 1666 after all).  But because I denied everything then opened selective ports (http, https, sshd, etc.) I got my butt covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting stuff.  Hopefully it'll be another 3 years before something like this happens again.  Of course, I'm going to have to keep on top of clients.  And tighten the hatches a bit more to make it even harder, but I think overall, this one went pretty good and no real damage was done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Linux on Toshiba's Libretto U100</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/linux-on-toshibas-libretto-u100" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-09-09T14:06:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-09-09T14:06:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-09-09:/blog/linux-on-toshibas-libretto-u100</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ahhh... it's cold out but I'm outside with my new couple-day old Toshiba Libretto U100.. typing is slow and I feel like my fingers are very fat, but I'm happy and satisfied.

After a couple days of struggling, I've got this little beast configured almost the way I want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toshiba Libretto is probably the smallest full-feature laptop I've ever laid eyes on.  It's got a Pentium M 1.1GHz chip, bluetooth, 802.11a/b/g, a dockable CD-RW/DVD+-RW drive, a USB-based fingeprint scanner, 2 USB2 ports, a firewire port, 10/100 ethernet, modem, PCMCIA card slot, a pin for an external monitor, 60GB HDD, 7.2" LCD screen (nice and bright!), and a SD card reader built in.  All this in a form factor of very very small (&lt;a href="http://www.toshiba.ca/web/product.grp?lg=en&amp;section=1&amp;group=1&amp;product=4470&amp;category="&gt;product page on toshiba.ca&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, getting this sucker setup was a bit of a chore and I'm not done yet by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was resize the Windows XP Home partition.  I gave it a little less than half the drive.  Next step was to install Mandriva LE2005.  This worked ok, but I couldn't get wireless working and could only get 800x600 using the fbdev driver, so I gave the 2006 RC1 a go.  Pretty much the same thing.  For kicks, I tried SUSE 9.3.  Different driver (vesa?), but same resolution.  Still no go on the wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can live with 800x600 even though the monitor supports 1280x768; what I can't live without is the wireless.  So I went back to Mandriva 2006 (the devil I know) and decided to get it working with it rather than fight with SUSE (I'm not a big fan of YaST, and SUSE seemed slower on this than Mandriva).  After some farting around, I downloaded the madwifi drivers from CVS (what came with Mandriva didn't work well, and ndiswrapper, which loaded ok, didn't seem to do anything).  Now we're getting somewhere!  Using "iwlist ath0 scan", I can pick up my AP's about 40-50% of the time.  Stupidly, Wireless Assistant (wlassistant) and the Mandriva Control Center could never, no matter how many times I refreshed/re-scanned) would never see the AP's.  As a result, I wrote a few shell scripts to set the connection and WEP, gave myself sudo access to run them as root, and off I go.  In retrospect, that was easier than changing networks via MCC anyways, although using wlassistant would have been nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I'm writing this outside, wireless, and it works peachy.  For anyone interested, I setup ath0 as a static IP address so it would come up and am using variations of the following script to make the connection (named roam-ESSID):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 down
/sbin/ifconfig ath0 down
/sbin/iwconfig ath0 essid [ESSID_NAME] mode Managed \
key [WEP_KEY]
/sbin/ifconfig ath0 up
/sbin/dhclient ath0
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works really well.  I have my doubts that I'll ever use this guy using physical ethernet, so I made sure that eth0 came down.  Oh!  I also removed ifplugd from the system and set MII_NOT_SUPPORTED=yes in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-{eth0,ath0} scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless now works like a hot damn.  I still have to figure out if I can boost the resolution on this (although 800x600 is ok), and see if I can get my MS Bluetooth mouse to work with it (I don't like the little accupoint stick).  Other than that, this machine is pretty slick.  I don't think it's doing any CPU frequency scaling, and the cpufreq package seems to contain just an initscript to load the modules but nothing to set any kind of profile.  I think I'd also like to be able to suspend the machine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still quite a bit to do yet, but so far I'm really enjoying this little guy.  And would you look at that!  My typing seems to be faster on it now too!  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt;  Played with suspending the machine using suspend-scripts.  "pmsuspend2 memory" seemed to work well, my power light was blinking which it never did in Windows when I tried to suspend it (which, incidentally, doesn't suspend worth crap either... oh to be a mac).  Anyways, powering it back on restored the image and then it shut off.  Nice.  Tried to use "pmsuspend2" just to suspend to disk and it worked, turned it on, came up quite quick, then rebooted by itself.  Interesting difference is that when suspending to disk, I got unclean filesystems; suspending to ram didn't although the end result was the same.  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oooo!  Adam Williamson is my fricking hero!  On his suggestion, I tried the i810 xorg driver and set the resolution to 1280x768.  Worked like a charm.  Now I have to squint to read anything again, but I have more screen room.  Thanks, Adam!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only things left to do are to get the SD card reader working and bluetooth (and by the looks of things, trying to get a bluetooth mouse working on it will be an exercise in PITA).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>How I hate thee LDAP authentication...</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/how-i-hate-thee-ldap-authentication" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-07-18T15:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-07-18T15:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-07-18:/blog/how-i-hate-thee-ldap-authentication</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find LDAP for authentication highly irritating.

It's better than some alternatives, like NIS (haven't looked at NIS+ so I don't know how it measures up), but man oh man, it's a real nuisance sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote that LDAP Authentication piece when there was essentially nothing else and it took a long time to figure out all the bits.  Now it seems like LDAP for authentication is all the rage.. everyone uses or wants to use it and I understand why.  In a large company or organization, it makes sense.  From that standpoint, centralized authentication is awesome.  But to administer the beast?  Good Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back when I first wrote the LDAP for Authentication paper, you used pam_pwdb in conjunction with pam_ldap and with a little massaging, you could make it so you could use the passwd program to change (you guessed it) passwords.  Then after a while, distros changed, other stuff changed, and pam_pwdb didn't work so good anymore.  At that point, pam_unix was the solution and it works great for doing lookups for authentication, but I've just realized (at least on my systems) it's pretty poor for handling password changing.  I can authenticate fine, but when I want to change my password, pam_unix is telling me that my username isn't in /etc/passwd or available by NIS.  Well, no duh... it's in the LDAP directory.  You're supposed to silently fail, fall back to pam_ldap, which will tell you everything is ok and I can carry on.  For kicks I tried switching back to pam_pwdb but it's just as dumb and I can't authenticate with it (I'm pretty sure it's trying to read from /etc/{passwd,shadow} directly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, thank goodness for PHPLdapAdmin.  At least I can change my password with it, but boy is it annoying that something that worked for me two years ago no longer works.  The really irritating thing is that it makes my document useful as a reference, but kinda useless for a real-world "hold my hand and let's do it".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerberos is easier than this for crying out loud and I used to think (mind you, about 5-6 years ago) that Kerberos was difficult.  Kerberos is a piece of bloody cake!&lt;/p&gt;

It made for quite a good chuckle at first.  To recap, an &lt;a href="http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/newss/5900/1/"&gt;interview on LinuxPlanet with Ian Murdock&lt;/a&gt; was published yesterday indicating, among other silly rhetoric, that &lt;i&gt;"Not only can they do it, my assertion is if they don't do it, they can't survive"&lt;/i&gt; which is Ian speaking about Mandriva buying a commercial Debian-based distribution to use Debian technologies.  Of course, this comes now that Mandriva (formerly MandrakeSoft) bought Conectiva and then bought Lycoris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really amusing because, for one, Ian Murdock is the "father" of Debian and it sounds very much like he's tooting his own horn here.  He also runs Progeny, which is also a commercial Debian-based distribution.  Does it sound like Ian is asking for a buyout?  A little too much to these tired ears.  Of course, he could be more blunt by saying that Mandriva needs to buy Progeny to survive, but maybe he's a tab bit more subtle than that.  Regardless, it sounds to me like he was doing the interview with his hands out asking for Mandriva to please give him a whack of cash because without it, Mandriva won't survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what are his reasons?  The first is that Debian has a good community.  Well, so does Mandriva.  Part of the reason Mandriva survived bankruptcy is due to the community that ponied up for services like MandrakeClub.  This goes to show that Mandriva does have a strong community.  And if you look at the development arena (cooker) at Mandriva, you'll see a lot of volunteers there doing a fair amount of work.  Sure, Mandriva's community (in terms of developers) isn't as big as Debian's, but that hasn't caused it to falter at all.  If this were a drowning point, Mandriva wouldn't have the assets to even consider these last two aquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His other point is that such a buyout by Mandriva would be a huge win for Debian, who just recently released the latest stable version (Sarge) after a 31-month development cycle.  Ok, sure, this would be nice for Debian, but how does that affect Mandriva's future?  Well, it doesn't.  That directly affects Debian's future (which, in the same article, Ian has some issues with).  How does it benefit Mandriva?  It doesn't.  So, let's be clear here.  Mandriva buying a Debian-based distro benefits Debian's future.  But how does it benefit Mandriva again?  Hmmm... nowhere does he really say &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; buying a Debian-based distro will benefit Mandriva (other than the larger community pool).  Oh wait, he says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Debian has an enormous opportunity in front of it," Murdock stated, if it can remain the center of Debian-based development. Having such a free, non-commercial center would be a strong selling point for any company to use Debian, he added, including Mandriva. Keeping Debian's core non-commercial would prevent any temptations to specialize the core code into something only one distributor could use.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm... how does this benefit Mandriva again?  Oh, it's a strong selling point.  This is because there is some popularity to other Debian-based distros like Xandros, Linspire and most importantly, Ubuntu.  Does Ian think that Mandriva will sell more subscriptions to MandrivaClub and retail boxes because it can stamp a "based on Debian" logo on the box?  I doubt it.  The same people who use Debian now will continue to use Debian.  A few may switch, but probably not enough to make an aquisition worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't get it.  The whole thing is to make this radical change from Mandriva's existing software base to change not only the package management tools (dpkg and apt vs rpm and urpmi), but also to roll-back to Debian-based packages that are largely out-dated by the time they're deemed stable?  Yes, Mandriva is moving towards more stability, but come on... a 31-month development cycle?  Debian in and of itself is still Debian, still ruled by the Debian community, and not overly influenced by outside commercial offerings.  If it were, then Ubuntu would &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the new Debian because at least Ubuntu is moving and moving quickly.  And while I think Mandriva is moving from "bleeding edge" to stable, it's not going to want to use 2 year old apps because someone at Debian is asleep at the wheel.  Which then means that Mandriva development will continue as it has, it would fork Debian's base and maintain it's own repositories which it would use, and then where's the benefit?  A sticker that says "loosely based on Debian"?  Yeah, that'll sell a lot of boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be the end of my morning chuckle if I didn't get another one today.  Now we get this &lt;a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2005-06-23-011-26-OP-DB-MD"&gt;editorial piece from Brian Masinick&lt;/a&gt; on Linux Today that opens with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I think that Ian Murdock is right on with regard to speculation about the future of Mandriva."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What?!?  Has this guy been smoking the same crack Ian was?  No, wait.. Ian's not smoking crack... he's begging for a buyout, probably because Ubuntu has so severely eclipsed Progeny as to make Progeny obsolete to all but it's existing client base.  Brian here is smoking a whole different kind of crack... the blind-eyed zealous kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arguments don't even make sense.  Half his editorial is trying to explain why he has a clue.  So what?  So he started out with Slack in '95 and didn't start to use Linux on the desktop until 2001.  So he used emacs and tar back in the '80's.  That doesn't at all indicate that he has a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arguments are the same.  Community.  Debian's community.  The theoretically bought-out company's community.  Nowhere is there a single piece of technical &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it should be done.  Everything is based on community.  So both Brian and Ian are saying that Mandriva won't survive if it can't buy Debian community.  Huh?  They expect Mandriva to completely overhaul how it does everything simply to buy a piece of Debian-using community?  That just doesn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He indicates that now that Mandriva and Conectiva have merged, Mandriva has &lt;i&gt;"one of the assets in house that can help accomplish a move from RPM packaging to DEB packaging: the great synaptic tool"&lt;/i&gt;.  Eh?  I'm pretty sure synaptic is open source and freely available and it seems pretty darn expensive to buy Conectiva just for a tool any idiot can download and use.  That purchase was for entry into Latin America and the client-base that Conectiva had (read: companies and government, not so much end-users).  See, that's strategy.  Buying users just to have more users from disparate parts of the globe doesn't make sense.  It would make more sense to buy TurboLinux and get a good foothold into Asia than it would to buy XYZ Debian-based distro just to get a bunch of users from who-knows-where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, regarding tools, Brian also says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mandrake did a pretty good job of turning urpmi into a pretty decent installation tool that nearly rivals apt-get, dpkg, aptitude, and synaptic, in terms of handling application and library packaging updates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if that's the case, why on earth would they want to change?  Give me a good technical reason for moving from rpm to deb and urpmi to apt-get!  He just said that urpmi nearly rivals apt-get and these other tools.  Granted, he calls it "decent" and that it "nearly rivals" but he never quite says what's wrong with it or why it doesn't measure up.  Maybe because he doesn't think it's important, or maybe he just doesn't know.  In my experience, urpmi is fast, smart, and pretty darn good.  It doesn't "nearly" rival, it does rival.  Granted, my experience with apt-get is limited to Fink on OS X, but heck, that's enough to give you a taste for the tool, and frankly, I'd be happier using urpmi on OS X than apt-get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is the really amusing part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I like the idea of centering that user community around a Debian approach because the Debian packaging fosters community, but even more importantly, the Debian Social Contract is all about community and freedom.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why is this a compelling reason to buy a Debian-based distro?  Because a &lt;i&gt;package&lt;/i&gt; fosters community?  The only community a &lt;i&gt;package&lt;/i&gt; (manager) fosters is the holier-than-thou-apt-is-god mentality most Debian users have.  I think it's more the idea that no one owns Debian that fosters it's community by and large, not the package management tool.  Sure, some people prefer it and that's why they prefer using Debian.  From a user's perspective, apt is nice.  But urpmi is just as good and just as easy.  So let's look at it from a technical perspective:  dpkg packages &lt;i&gt;suck&lt;/i&gt;.  They are really badly put together... if there's something that needs a change, dpkg is it.  Sure, there are some benefits to it like a package can recommend another package and so on, but the bottom line is working with a dpkg is a pain and RPM has nicely laid out the spec file to do all the work, separate patch files to make maintenance of patches &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; much easier than dpkg's one-file-fits-all mentality.  When I have to pull security patches out of Ubuntu or Debian packages, I cringe because they're so painful to use once you're used to simple spec file and distinct patches.  Pulling a patch out of a Red Hat or SUSE package is 10x easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final point before I wrap this up.  Ian mentioned LSB support and whatnot for Debian as another selling point of Debian.  Guess what Ian...  LSB chose RPM as the defacto packaging system, not DEB.  So if LSB support is such a big thing, why hasn't Debian switched over to using RPM, like the LSB recommends?  For instance, in the original interview Ian says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One such benefit could be the re-establishment of Debian as the central Linux Standard Base distribution, something that was originally intended when Bruce Perens initially proposed the LSB. The LSB, Murdock feels, has been weakened by other commercial distros' lack of full participation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm... Debian is the one lacking full participation.  Has Ian not read the pertinent part of the &lt;a href="http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_2.0.1/LSB-Core/LSB-Core.html#PACKAGEFMT"&gt;LSB specs&lt;/a&gt;?  I'll quote it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Applications shall either be packaged in the RPM packaging format as defined in this specification, or supply an installer which is LSB conforming (for example, calls LSB commands and utilities).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the end of the day, Mandriva, a company committed to the LSB, is on the right track using RPM as the base, and not the non-LSB-conforming DEB packaging system.  It can be argued that DEB falls under "LSB conforming", but it's still not the recommended system.  RPM is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me a break.  I for one hope Mandriva stays as far away from Debian-based distros as possible, not only due to the inferiority of dpkg itself, but because it doesn't need this kind of clueless zealotry advocating it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Using runit instead of SysVinit</title><link href="https://annvix.com/blog/using-runit-instead-of-sysvinit" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-03-21T12:21:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-03-21T12:21:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:annvix.com,2005-03-21:/blog/using-runit-instead-of-sysvinit</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been a huge fan of service-style handling of daemons since I first played with qmail a number of years ago.

When I first decided to start my own proof-of-concept secure Linux distro (&lt;a href="http://annvix.org/"&gt;Annvix&lt;/a&gt;), one of the first things I decided on was to use daemontools to manage supervised services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, daemontools is a little bit encumbered due to DJB's licensing restrictions, and that's when I came upon runit which, in my mind, is the cat's meow. Not only does it do what daemontools does, but it also completely replaces SysVinit which means I didn't have to deal with both systems. This also spurred me to completely port the initscripts for services I was shipping to run scripts for use with runit. No excuse for laziness by keeping both systems. =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this morning I found a nice writeup about using runit called "&lt;a href="http://www.pycs.net/lateral/stories/36.html"&gt;Booting with runit&lt;/a&gt;". This is a pretty good description of what runit is, does, and why it should be preferred over SysVinit. Unfortunately, the author didn't know that Annvix was the first Linux distro to be 100% runit out of the box... so I had to let him know about that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry></feed>
