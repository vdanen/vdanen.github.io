            <p>I&#8217;ve refrained from posting or saying anything about Heartbleed all week because I didn&#8217;t want to add to any sensationalism and hype, and I&#8217;ve also been too busy actually dealing with it (as opposed to simply talking about it or running around with hands waving in the air like a mad man).  Now that the dust has settled a bit, I just want to link to some sites that I think are good to keep handy as we see this play out.  I don&#8217;t need to talk about the flaw itself as all you need to do is google &#8220;heartbleed&#8221; and you&#8217;ll get all the info you want; certainly more than I can provide here (although you will have to distill the sensational from the&nbsp;facts).</p>
<p>So, the&nbsp;sites:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://zmap.io/heartbleed/">Heartbleed Bug Health Report</a>; they&#8217;re keeping it up to date, but it&#8217;s essentially a &#8220;top 1000 still-vulnerable sites&#8221; list
<li> <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/04/09/heartbleed-bug-websites-affected/">Mashable&#8217;s Heartbleed Hit List</a> which has a list of some of the bigger sites/services that were (or were not) affected and whether they still are; when I looked this morning it was last updated as of last night so presumably they&#8217;re keeping it fairly up to date
<li> <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/heartbleed-bug-apps-affected-list/#!DLTZK">DigitalTrends Mobile app list</a> which has a list of vulnerable/not-vulnerable mobile apps
<li> <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">The Heartbleed site</a> which is being kept up to date with regards to linking to various advisories
</ul>

<p>Some of these sites (and the apps that use such sites) have been fixed this week.  There is speculation that this has been known for a while which means the &#8220;window of opportunity&#8221; may be much bigger than was initially thought.  Some of the numbers being tossed around are pretty gross exaggerations though (one I saw was &#8220;66% of the internet vulnerable!&#8221;) so you have to take things with a grain of salt.  The best advice is to look at the sites you use and if they have fixed the flaw (and were previously vulnerable) and recommend you doing something (like changing your password), strongly consider doing as they suggest &#8212; <b><span class="caps">PROVIDED</span> <span class="caps">THEY</span> <span class="caps">HAVE</span> <span class="caps">ALREADY</span> <span class="caps">FIXED</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FLAW</span></b>!  Sorry for the caps but I talked to some people yesterday who had rushed to change their password and when I asked them if the site in question was fixed already, they gave me a blank&nbsp;stare.</p>
<p>It does you <span class="caps">NO</span> good to change your password to a site that is <span class="caps">STILL</span> vulnerable.  You will only have to change it&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Anyways, look at the sites noted above, breathe, and keep in mind that changing passwords occasionally is a good thing.  Maybe now is the time to start using something like LastPass, 1Password, KeePass, or something similar and having it generate pure random nonsense for a password, knowing that you can use this tool/service to remember it for you (although, arguably, this whole situation makes me quite happy that I use 1Password (an app on my computer) instead of a&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>My last point on this is that people need to upgrade if they&#8217;re using an affected version of OpenSSL.  If you are, and your operating system provides it (which is the case with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, among many others) then you really should be updating to the packages provided.  It&#8217;s not a question of whether you should or shouldn&#8217;t &#8212; you should.  Period.  This has been a crazy week and a lot of crazy things have happened and this is a really really bad thing <span class="caps">IF</span> you&#8217;re affected.  So if you are (as in you&#8217;re running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or a current Fedora, etc.) then you really need to update <span class="caps">ASAP</span>.  And then you need to assess your next steps (changing passwords on vulnerable (and now fixed) services, revoking and reissuing certificates if you feel it necessary,&nbsp;etc.).</p>
<p>Anyways, that&#8217;s all I have to say about Heartbleed.  It will be interesting to see what the next few weeks will be like as we continue to get a bigger picture of what&#8217;s happened here, how, and to whom.  And to see what damage has been done, and who responded appropriately and when.  For instance, if there were a site or service I was using and as of today (being Saturday, and this thing exploded on Monday) it was still <span class="caps">NOT</span> fixed, I don&#8217;t think I would be using that site/service anymore.  To put it into perspective, Red Hat had updates out late Monday for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 and the other affected products early Tuesday morning (my time).  Everything was available to customers in under 24hrs.  It&#8217;s not hard to install &#8212; &#8220;yum update&#8221; and reboot (to make sure everything is covered).  So for a site to be still affected by this now?  There&#8217;s really no excuse as far as I&#8217;m&nbsp;concerned.</p>
<p>Finally, just to note that I did get some minor press coverage (so this is more vanity than useful), <a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/FOSS-Community-Hustles-to-Fix-Gaping-Heartbleed-Flaw-80263.html">LinuxInsider reported on Heartbleed</a> and my name is noted, although my answers to the questions must have been less than exciting as there wasn&#8217;t too much noted there other than where Red Hat customers could go for more info.&nbsp;=)</p>
<p>And to finish off, the obligatory&nbsp;xkcd:</p>
