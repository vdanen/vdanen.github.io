            <p>A good friend of mine has over the last little while been feeding me some really great books that have made me re-evaluate a lot of things.  The first book is &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Zen-Simple-Design-Delivery/dp/0321525655">PresentationZen</a>&#8221; (<span class="caps">ISBN</span>: 978-0-321-52565-9) which gives some really great ideas regarding presentation design and delivery of presentations.  While it primarily focuses on design pertaining to things like powerpoint, the &#8220;rules&#8221; the author talks about (be they rules of design or rules of how humans look at and interact with things) are powerful and applicable to everything, including software design/presentation, or web sites, or anything you <em>look</em>&nbsp;at.</p>
<p>The second book, which I haven&#8217;t quite finished yet, but which absolutely blew me away, is &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matter-Great-Design-People-Company/dp/0137142447">Do you matter?  How great design will make people love your company</a>&#8221; (<span class="caps">ISBN</span>: 978-0-13-714244-6).  This book is freaking&nbsp;amazing.</p>
<p>Speaking in the context of Mandriva, this is a book every developer, manager, and <span class="caps">CEO</span> needs to read.  It&#8217;s no revelation that we&#8217;re in a bit of a tough spot and I think (although I don&#8217;t know for sure) that the <span class="caps">CEO</span> is seeking to reinvent Mandriva in some way to make us profitable.  Nothing wrong with the idea, but the execution may be up for debate.  I have no doubt that he can do it (his track record shows he&#8217;s done it before), but the dynamics are different with this kind of company compared to a traditional company.  Which makes the ideas and things brought up in &#8220;Do you matter?&#8221; especially&nbsp;relevant.</p>
<p>The basic premise is that &#8220;design&#8221; is the be-all and end-all, and the ultimate indicator of good design is customer experience and, more importantly, customer <em>emotion</em>.  So much so that the first goal and focus, above all else, should be the customer experience/emotion.  It&#8217;s no surprise to anyone that without customers, no company can survive.  But without happy and satisfied customers, no company can <em>thrive</em>.</p>
<p>To use one of the authors examples, look at Microsoft vs Apple.  In Microsoft&#8217;s case, there is extremely poor design&#8230; in all aspects of the company (we&#8217;re not just talking software here, but the whole &#8220;culture&#8221; &#8212; everything that brings the customer an experience, whether it&#8217;s good or bad).  The basic consensus of people when they think of Microsoft is like that of the utility company &#8212; they don&#8217;t really like them, but they need them.  Contrast that to Apple where most people love the products, be it the iPod, iPhone, hardware, <span class="caps">OS</span>&#8230; whatever.  Apple takes the design-driven company all the way.  From presentations at <span class="caps">WWDC</span>, to the box you get your iPod in, to the ease-of-use and look-n-feel of Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X, the customer experience is the first thing in their minds.  And this is why they can charge a premium on their stuff, and people will willingly pay it.  For the <em>experience</em> the end user gets and the emotions it creates (think warm&nbsp;fuzzies).</p>
<p>You can contrast this to anything.  If you had a rotten experience at one hotel, do you go back?  Or do you try something that is more expensive and find a great experience there?  In the future, do you save a few bucks for a crappy experience, or spend a few more for a great experience?  What about the store you buy groceries from?  Where you buy coffee?  Sure, for some people price rules, but for many people it&#8217;s all about the experience.  If you buy a car, and it&#8217;s a really great price and turns out to be utter crap, do you buy another car from this company?  Or do you spend more to buy a better car, with a better experience?  And what is your perception of the first company?  That they sell crappy cars, have poor customer service, and you&#8217;re damn well going to tell everyone you know to avoid them like the&nbsp;plague.</p>
<p>So&#8230; bottom line is the customer experience and the emotions that experience&nbsp;generates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably blog more about this and break it up into a few pieces, but let me leave you with a few questions asked in the book &#8220;Do you&nbsp;matter?&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li> Who are you?
<li> What do you do?
<li> Do your customers care if you live or die?
</ul>

<p>These are potent&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>Who are you?  An open source company?  How about something deeper than that.  An open source company that provides a Linux distribution?  Still pretty vague.  Who are you <em>really</em>?  An open source Linux company that aims to bring the best possible Linux-based desktop experience?  That sounds pretty good&#8230; but is that who we actually <em>are</em>?</p>
<p>What do you do?  Provide a Linux distribution.  Not deep enough.  Think about it.  What do we <em>do</em>?  What is the actual end <em>goal</em>?</p>
<p>Do your customers care if you live or die?  This is the real question.  With the many blog posts, articles, forum threads, and so forth I have to say that yes, our customers/users care.  Would their lives diminish somewhat if we weren&#8217;t around?  I&#8217;d like to think that yes, it would.  But would it <em>really</em>?  There&#8217;s always Ubuntu.  Always Fedora.  I hear OpenSUSE is pretty decent.  What distinguishes <em>us</em> from <em>them</em> to the point that there would be the equivalent of an online &#8220;riot&#8221; if Mandriva all of a sudden&nbsp;disappeared?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the answers to these questions.  I do know that we used to have pretty clear goals and really strove to meet them.  And we also had a massive community then too.  Extremely active mailing lists, you name it&#8230; Mandrake was <em>the</em> distro.  And somehow, somewhere, we lost our way.  Maybe we lost our focus on the customer experience.  I don&#8217;t know.  I do know that it can be turned around&#8230; it&#8217;s not too late.  I think one solution is to become a design-driven company and put the user experience first and foremost, above everything else.  And then design our technology, methodology, philosophy, business practices, etc. around it.  It wouldn&#8217;t be easy, but it could&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>For anyone running a company, or starting a company, or even anyone involved in any kind of organization or community, I <em>highly</em> recommend reading &#8220;Do you matter?&#8221;.  It provides insight into things I never before thought of and answers the one nagging question I&#8217;ve had for years:  Why is Ubuntu so popular when it&#8217;s technologically inferior?  I don&#8217;t mean to start a flamewar or anything here, but the tools Mandriva has blow away anything Ubuntu has.  I&#8217;ve tried it, and didn&#8217;t like it (possibly because I&#8217;m jaded by too much Mandriva exposure, who knows).  But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that Ubuntu has had such wild success that to many people Linux ==&nbsp;Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Makes you wonder&#8230;  there are a number of tissue-creating companies out there&#8230; Scotties, Kleenex, the no-name brands you find at the grocery store.  Yet what is a tissue commonly called, without even thinking?&nbsp;Kleenex.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave that for you to chew&nbsp;on.</p>
