<p>You know your wife is a keeper when she gets you a YubiKey 4 for your birthday!  I was really excited about this YubiKey because of its support
for storing your <span class="caps">GPG</span> private keys and also for an <span class="caps">SSH</span> private key, in addition to the <span class="caps">U2F</span> (Universal 2nd Factor) support.  I&#8217;ve been using
earlier versions of the YubiKey for <span class="caps">OTP</span> (one-time password) and <span class="caps">U2F</span>, but the new version was especially interesting to me because of the <span class="caps">GPG</span>&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>Plus it&#8217;s a new toy to tinker with, and I like nerdy little things like&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>When I got it, it was easy enough to associate it with the accounts I previously had my <span class="caps">U2F</span>-only YubiKey associated with and also others I previously had not and probably should&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>However, when it came to getting this setup for GnuPG I ran into some interesting things.  First off, I used this <a href="https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide">YubiKey
Guide</a> to get things setup (this is a great guide).  I did it on my Fedora laptop because from the things I
read it seemed that using Linux for the setup would be&nbsp;easier.</p>
<p>That guide is pretty Debian-specific when it comes to the software install, so on Fedora you want to&nbsp;use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$<span class="w"> </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>dnf<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>ykpers<span class="w"> </span>libyubikey<span class="w"> </span>gnupg2<span class="w"> </span>gnupg2-smime<span class="w"> </span>pcsc-list<span class="w"> </span>pcsc-lite-ccid
</pre></div>


<p>Creating the new key on the laptop was easy enough with the instructions provided but I ran into problems writing the keys to the YubiKey.  I could
program the card as root, but as the user that generated the key I was unable to write the keys.  With a bit more hunting around, I found another
blog post about using the <a href="http://stafwag.github.io/blog/blog/2015/06/16/using-yubikey-neo-as-gpg-smartcard-for-ssh-authentication/">YubiKey Neo as a <span class="caps">GPG</span> Smartcard for <span class="caps">SSH</span> Authentication</a> and realized I needed to give myself access to write to the card via&nbsp;udev.</p>
<p>Editing the <code>/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/69-yubikey.rules</code> file to add myself as an owner of the device did the trick and now it looks&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">ACTION</span><span class="o">!=</span><span class="ss">&quot;add|change&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">GOTO</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="ss">&quot;yubico_end&quot;</span>

<span class="n">LABEL</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="ss">&quot;yubico_end&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then reloading the configuration&nbsp;using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sudo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">udevadm</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">control</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--</span><span class="n">reload</span>
<span class="o">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sudo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">udevadm</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">trigger</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now I could finish with the original tutorial and get the keys written to the card.&nbsp;Success!</p>
<p>Or so I thought.  Once this was done, the <span class="caps">U2F</span> logins were no longer working.  Plugging the YubiKey into my mac and trying to use it as the
second factor with some of the sites it previously worked with was no longer&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Given this was already a few hours of work, I went off to eat dinner and watch a show with the family.  When that was done, as often happens when
you give your mind something else to think about, it occurred to me that the command in the original tutorial about changing the mode of the YubiKey might have had something to do with it.  The original tutorial indicates that to configure the YubiKey you needed to&nbsp;do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$<span class="w"> </span>ykpersonalize<span class="w"> </span>-m82
</pre></div>


<p>Checking out the manpage, it seems that this mode of 82&nbsp;sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>MODE_FLAG_EJECT (which is the&nbsp;80)</li>
<li><span class="caps">OTP</span>/<span class="caps">CCID</span> composite device (which is the&nbsp;2)</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess earlier YubiKeys did not enable <span class="caps">CCID</span> which is what we need for <span class="caps">GPG</span> support.  But guess what&#8217;s missing?  Right, the <span class="caps">U2F</span> support.  We need mode 6, which is for <span class="caps">OTP</span>/<span class="caps">CCID</span>/<span class="caps">U2F</span>.  So&nbsp;running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$<span class="w"> </span>ykpersonalize<span class="w"> </span>-m86
</pre></div>


<p>fixed the problem and now <span class="caps">U2F</span> works again (as does <span class="caps">GPG</span>).</p>
<p>The next problem I had was that, while <span class="caps">GPG</span> worked fine on my Fedora laptop, when I tried to do <code>gpg2 --list-secret-keys</code> on my mac, it was telling me there were no secret keys.  Using <code>gpg2 --card-status</code> or <code>gpg2 --card-edit</code> worked fine, and they even showed those card slots&nbsp;occupied.</p>
<p>What the&nbsp;heck?!?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out <span class="caps">GPG</span> 2.1 uses a different format for storing key information that <span class="caps">GPG</span> 1.x and 2.0 don&#8217;t support or understand.  And MacGPG2 for the mac is currently providing 2.0.30 which didn&#8217;t understand this stuff.  And it turns out that fink (which I use for all the extra Linux-like commands and updated <span class="caps">CLI</span> tools that I like) did not provide GnuPG 2.1.  As a result I switched from fink to HomeBrew because it provides GnuPG 2.1, which I found from <a href="https://www.rempe.us/blog/yubikey-gnupg-2-1-and-ssh/">Yubikey, GnuPG 2.1 Modern, and <span class="caps">SSH</span> on macOS</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still some work to be done to clean a few things up.  I need to publish my new <span class="caps">GPG</span> key once I&#8217;m confident with it, and have signed it with
my existing key, and revoked the old key.  Then I need to put the new <span class="caps">SSH</span> pubkey on those servers that are critical and I want the higher security&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Most of what I had to do to get this setup was already out there (thank you citizens of the internet!) but there were a few gotchas that others may
stumble on and since I couldn&#8217;t easily find any answers (maybe I&#8217;m the only one that tripped over the ykpersonalize, or maybe most people use these for <span class="caps">GPG</span>/<span class="caps">SSH</span> and not also <span class="caps">U2F</span>, I have no idea).  Hopefully this will be helpful for anyone stuck in the same&nbsp;boat.</p>
<p>Quick notes on some macOS-specific&nbsp;things:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a MailMate user (awesome email client) but the suggestion of using a command-line pinentry program causes it to crash because it can&#8217;t get input from anywhere.  You want to <code>brew install pinentry-mac</code> first, and then use that as the pinentry program for the gpg-agent.  My <code>~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</code> file now looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>enable-ssh-support
use-standard-socket
pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac
default-cache-ttl 600
max-cache-ttl 7200
</pre></div>


<p>You will also want to uninstall MacGPG2 if you have it installed.  You can re-install it if you want, as it does have some nice tools, but if you do be sure to select &#8220;Customize&#8221; on the installer and de-select &#8220;GPGMail&#8221; and &#8220;MacGPG2&#8221; (basically install &#8220;GPGServices&#8221;, &#8220;GPGKeychain&#8221;, and &#8220;GPGPreferences&#8221; only).  I don&#8217;t know if the GPGMail plugin will work with GnuPG 2.1 (I don&#8217;t use Apple Mail and MailMate doesn&#8217;t need it) so maybe you don&#8217;t need to remove it (and I can&#8217;t be bothered to find&nbsp;out).</p>
<p>As a final note, I had this working fine with two macs and my Fedora laptop, but when I tried it on another mac a day or two later it did not want to work.  I finally figured out that it was because when I started fiddling with this, on the first two macs I had gnupg 2.1.17 but on the other mac it pulled the new version (2.1.18) from homebrew.  This new version does not play well with the YubiKey.  I filed <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions/issues/1522">this bug</a> against homebrew but then after some more digging I found it was actually <a href="https://bugs.gnupg.org/gnupg/issue2933">this upstream bug</a> so hopefully 2.1.19 will fix the problem.  I note it here only because it had me scratching my head for a few days going through my setups wondering if I had done something wrong on the last mac.  Once I installed 2.1.17 on that one, everything worked peachy.  Talk about whacky&nbsp;timing!</p>
<p>Thanks Ang for this awesome birthday present!&nbsp;=)</p>
