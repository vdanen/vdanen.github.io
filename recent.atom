&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to attend Red Hat Summit 2023 which you can &lt;a href="https://reg.experiences.redhat.com/flow/redhat/sum23/regVirtual/login"&gt;watch on demand&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, MA.

Unlike the OSS Summit, this was a 14h door-to-door trip, there and back, due to delays (typically 12h door-to-door).  However the annoyance in travel was more than made up for by the energy of the Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was probably the best Red Hat Summit I've attended.  Unlike last year that was more executive-focued and smaller, this one was a lot bigger, a lot busier, and was absolutely buzzing!  After COVID and so many years or not having an in-person Summit, everyone was happy to be there, energized, talking, and excited.  Beyond that, the product announcements this year were really exciting, things like: Ansible Lightspeed, Trusted Application Platform, Developer Hub and Services Interconnect to name a few.  You can get the lowdown of all the announcements from the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/red-hat-summit-newsroom"&gt;Red Hat Summit 2023 Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; which has a bunch of links to different announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first Summit where I was on the keynote stage giving a quick demo about Red Hat Trusted Application Platform with my friend, and overly experienced presenter, Burr Sutter.  It was gratifying to hear later how well received this demo was!  You can &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0LCmCkwRcOE?t=3565"&gt;watch our demo on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; starting at 59:25 which has Ashesh's preamble and setup first then the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there I was again invited to be on theCube and talked about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvpmNeFvDo8"&gt;Trusted Application Pipeline, supply chain security, open source security, SBOMs and more&lt;/a&gt;.  (Try to ignore the clicking, I'm going to have to get them to mic me up on the side where I have less earrings in the future!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also great to connect with Red Hatters I've never met in person or those I've not been able to meet for some time (and those I was hanging with at the OSS Summit two weeks prior!).  It was an excellent event, very busy, very exhausting, but at the same time very energizing as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="redhat"></category></entry><entry><title>OSS Summit 2023</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/oss-summit-2023.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-13T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-08-20T08:15:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2023-05-13:/blog/oss-summit-2023.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/LF-Event-Logo-_OSS-NA-V-White-01-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Probably the easiest conference I've ever attended, travel-wise, as it was about three hours door-to-door.  Contrast that to Red Hat Summit in Boston, which is about 12 hours door-to-door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to attend the &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/"&gt;OSS Summit 2023&lt;/a&gt; in Vancouver, BC.  Probably the easiest conference I've ever attended, travel-wise, as it was about three hours door-to-door.  Contrast that to Red Hat Summit in Boston, which is about 12 hours door-to-door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was great, I believe there were about 2,000 people in person.  It was awesome to catch up with some folks I've not seen in a while (even ran into someone from SUSE who worked at Mandriva when I did; last time we met had to be around 16 years ago in Paris!).  Unfortunately I didn't get to attend too many talks, although I did attend a few at the OpenSSF day.  My schedule was too busy and I was too busy talking with customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a few other obligations.  I gave Red Hat's keynote, which is typically given by Chris Wright, Red Hat's CTO, but he was in Europe for something else and couldn't make it.  While not my first keynote ever, it was the largest stage thus far.  Presumably it was well-received given some of the feedback I've gotten and you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cgU6M0oXMQ"&gt;watch the keynote here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMMBNLoEn5Y"&gt;interview with theCube&lt;/a&gt; which was great.  We talked about security and open source (what else?!) and it was a lot of fun.  A great conversation, thanks for having me on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was on the &lt;a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2023/07/05/trusted-software-supply-chain/"&gt;Software Engineering Daily
podcast&lt;/a&gt;
talking about all kinds of things from secure software, secure supply
chain, to open source in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a great week and it was good to catch up with and reconnect with some folks I've not seen in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

topics over the last few weeks that have been published.  The most recent
is a blog post I co-authored with Tracy Ragan at
&lt;a href="https://www.deployhub.com/"&gt;DeployHub&lt;/a&gt; entitled &lt;a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2023/04/06/sboms-so-far-so-good-so-what/"&gt;SBOMs, So Far, So Good,
So
What?&lt;/a&gt;
where we take a look at the concerning trend of everyone talking about what
a good SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) should be, but very little on how
to consume it, or what you do once you've got it.  Actually, I was
discussing the topic with my wife and, amusingly, we had watched Conan the
Destroyer a few weeks ago and she said: "Grab it, and take it!" to which I
responded: "Once you've got it, what do you do with it?" -- I didn't think
that was the most appropriate way to title the blog post though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who've never seen Conan the Destroyer, here's a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPkhh5JytYE"&gt;clip of the
scene&lt;/a&gt; although it doesn't
have her followup of "once you've got him, what do you do with him?" 🤣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I was featured in the latest Red Hat Security Detail
episode, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSyEGkX6sX0"&gt;CVE and CVSS explained | Security
Detail&lt;/a&gt; that I had gone to
Raleigh, NC last year to film.  I thought it turned out pretty well, and is
me (again) talking about a risk-based approach to vulnerability management
vs the old-school (and ineffective) check-box-based security.  There's a
companion article entitled &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security/what-is-cve?sc_cid=7013a0000034s1WAAQ"&gt;What is a
CVE?&lt;/a&gt;
to go along with the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had a co-worker who is from Eastern Canada who was in town for a
day and he has this thing on LinkedIn called "Todd Talks" so we did two
videos for that.  The first is again talking about vulnerability management
in my kitchen: &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7043935762429403136/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;Todd Talks security
1&lt;/a&gt;
and the second &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7046704024363921408/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;Todd Talks security
2&lt;/a&gt;
where we talk about risk profiles and vulnerability scoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't things I would necessarily be comfortable doing in the past,
but I'm leaning into them because there's some really good messaging that
needs to go out.  So hopefully these inspire some new thinking about how we
fix vulnerabilities, and when, while also keeping the conversation going.
When I talk to customers 1:1 and explain this, they understand... fixing
all vulnerabilities isn't scalable or effective, and the numbers bear that
out (see the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/product-security-risk-report-2022"&gt;2022 Product Security Risk
Report&lt;/a&gt;
particularly when it comes to known exploitation).  We could spend a lot of
time fixing things that don't matter, or we can spend time fixing what
truly matters, responding quickly when it starts to matter, and focus
engineering and operational effort on things that actually provide value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to talk about there, and a lot of old-school thinking that
needs to be changed.  Let the conversation continue!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Joplin server on TrueNAS Scale</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/joplin-server-on-truenas-scale.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-05T16:42:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-03-05T16:42:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2023-03-05:/blog/joplin-server-on-truenas-scale.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm an avid note taker and have migrated through a series of different

tools to take notes, some proprietary and some open source.  I've gone
through Quiver, Inkdrop, Agenda, and recently I migrated everything to
Joplin.  But I wanted to be able to sync my notes between devices and I
didn't want it anywhere accessible to the public.  Since I run TrueNAS
Scale at home, and there's a TrueCharts application for the beta Joplin
Server... I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked great and I've been syncing the Joplin client on my desktop to
the TrueNAS-based Joplin Server for some time but not without HTTPS, which
wasn't really an issue since it was only available in my home network and
the notes are encrypted, but I was having issues trying to get Joplin on my
iPad to work and from what I'd read, having it sync over HTTPS rather than
HTTP was the way to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a bit of time and effort, had to change the TrueNAS Scale system from
being a single-IP via DHCP to a static IP with an alias, to bind all the
kubernetes applications to the second IP address, setting up another
wildcard Let's Encrypt certificate to work with Traefik (which I also
installed as an application).  Now I can connect to Joplin Server and my
PiHole application via HTTPS on their own dedicated subdomain.  It's
actually quite slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main reason for noting this here is because I have a terrible memory
(hence the long journey through a number of note-taking applications!) and
I wanted to reference this YouTub video: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSMgfz5zrxo"&gt;Secure HTTPS for all your TrueNAS Scale Apps (traefik)&lt;/a&gt;
which was an amazing help and got me through the setup pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find some of the application configuration to be quite overwhelming, so
noting here the most important pieces to remember when configuring an
application to use Traefik in your applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;Networking and Services&lt;/strong&gt; you want to set the "Service Type" to
&lt;code&gt;ClusterIP (Do Not Expose Ports)&lt;/code&gt; because Traefik is your ingress
service, so only expose the application to the internal kubernetes network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;Ingress&lt;/strong&gt; you want to tick &lt;code&gt;Enable Ingress&lt;/code&gt; under the "Main
Ingress" section.  You'll need to add a Host and give it a HostName to
reach the application on (i.e. &lt;code&gt;joplin.subdomain.mynetwork.com&lt;/code&gt; or
whatever (in this example I'd have a Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate for
&lt;code&gt;*.subdomain.mynetwork.com&lt;/code&gt;.  You need to add a Path but it will
typically just be &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;TLS Settings&lt;/strong&gt; you want to add a Certificate Host which will have the
same hostname as your main ingress host above
(joplin.subdomain.mynetwork.com).  In the "Use TrueNAS SCALE Certificate
(Deprecated)" you want to select your wildcard Let's Encrypt certifcate.
Not sure why it's labelled "depricated" because it works (maybe it goes
away in the future?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest can pretty much be left alone.  So even though Joplin Server
listens to port 22300, doing the above you can connect on port 443 of the
wildcard domain, using HTTPS, and synchronize just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obnoxiously, the iPad client is throwing a different error now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Last error: Error: Error 404 Not Found: Invalid origin:
http://joplin.subdomain.mynetwork.com:443
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This error makes no sense as I have the Joplin Server URL in the iPad
client set to https://, not http:// ... so something to figure out later I
suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I didn't get it precisely where I wanted it, but now it has
full end-to-end encryption and I can configure PiHole over TLS which always
makes me happier.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="truenas"></category></entry><entry><title>OpenSSF spotlight</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/openssf-spotlight.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-15T11:55:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-02-15T11:55:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2023-02-15:/blog/openssf-spotlight.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I had the opportunity to be interviewed as a member of the OpenSSF

governing board.  In fact, I'm not sure I mentioned this here before...
I've been an observer on the board for all of 2022 and at the beginning of
2023 I joined the governing board as a member to represent Red Hat and bring my own
extensive experience in open source software, and security, to the table.
The interview "&lt;a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2023/02/14/spotlight-on-openssf-board-member-vincent-danen-vice-president-of-product-security-red-hat/"&gt;Spotlight on OpenSSF Board Member: Vincent Danen, Vice President of Product
Security, Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;"
was a lot of fun to do and hopefully interesting to people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, you can't do this kind of work without tying it to
something that you value.  For me that's people.  Sure, the model of open
source is interesting and awesome, the software produced is amazing, but I
think where a lot of folks suffer from short-sightedness is the focus on
the software itself, not what you can actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with it and the impact
it has on society.  How we have leapt forward so quickly with technology is
parallels how society has evolved from a humanitarian perspective (and I'd
really like to separate that from a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;idealogical&lt;/em&gt;
perspective because I'm not convinced we've progressed in those areas, to
be honest... but that's a topic for another day!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, hope you find the interview interesting.  Would be keen to get
some thoughts on it -- do you feel the same?  Different?  Sadly no comments

&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are at the end of 2022 and frankly, I'm hoping 2023 will be better.  Is it just me or do things seem to continue getting worse?  The economic uncertainty, war, inept governments, broken medical systems, intolerance &lt;em&gt;across the board&lt;/em&gt;, and everyone seeming angry about everything... this year has been a challenging one to remain positive.  And that's just anecdotal.  Apologies for starting this off on such a sour note but I had such high hopes for 2022 that were quite quickly dashed and... well, the world just feels like it's circling the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a lovely way to start this blog post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there have been some good upsides as well.  I wrote a lot more this year, which meant there was more content on this site, even if a lot of it is just pointers to other publications, such as the recent post on &lt;a href="https://opensource.com/article/22/12/tools-open-source-vulnerability-management"&gt;opensource.com&lt;/a&gt;, the article for &lt;a href="https://research.redhat.com/blog/article/when-is-it-secure-enough-vulnerability-research-and-the-future-of-vulnerability-management/"&gt;Red Hat Research Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/do-all-vulnerabilities-really-matter"&gt;Red Hat blog on vulnerability management&lt;/a&gt; and also on &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/curated-tested-and-supported-how-enterprise-vendors-mitigate-open-source-supply-chain-risk"&gt;supply chain risks&lt;/a&gt;, so there was a reasonable amount of writing done.  Also I was interviewed on &lt;a href="https://zerobytesgiven.com/episodes/season_one/vincent_danen/"&gt;ZeroBytesGiven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjXrwx5HOvM"&gt;SiliconAngle&lt;/a&gt;, both of which were a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year I joined the &lt;a href="https://openssf.org/"&gt;OpenSSF&lt;/a&gt; governing board as an observer and at the end of the year I took on the responsibility of representing Red Hat on the board instead of Chris Wright, which is a great privilege and honor.  I'm looking forward to representing Red Hat and the open source communities there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have been pretty good at work this year.  Red Hat is weathering the economic conditions fairly well and while it impacted us by having to slow down hiring, it could have been worse like it's been with some other companies.  We had a fair bit of turnover and really saw the effects of the so-called Great Resignation, but we've gotten some pretty incredible people to take those spots so I feel pretty good about it.  The team has been charging &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; this year, getting a lot done.  If you read the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/channel/security"&gt;Red Hat security blog&lt;/a&gt; there's quite a few articles written by folks on the team about all the incredible work that's been done this year.  It hasn't been without its challenges, and I'm really proud of the team and all they've accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nice to get back to seeing people in person again this year.  After a few years of not traveling (which I didn't mind!) I had actually started to miss it. The first trip this year was pretty nerve-wracking due to lingering COVID concerns, the stupid Arrive-CAN app, chaos at airports...  It was good to start traveling so as to see people in person again, but the travel experience itself was truly painful at times.  This year I went to Singapore for the first time, Boston a few times, Raleigh a few times, Denver for the first time, and Lake Tahoe for the Linux Foundation Member Summit, a first for both the event and the location.  Being in all of these places was great... getting there, or getting home, left much to be desired.  On my way to Boston I had to spend a night in the Pearson airport because, after sitting on the plane for an hour to leave for Boston, there was no ground crew to wheel us back from the terminal, and when all the planes emptied, all of the available hotel rooms nearby were booked solid.  So many planes delayed, so many times running for planes that I didn't need to run to, because they were also delayed.  Took my first WestJet/Delta flights in years and I'll never do that again... delays on the way to California, missed the flight to Reno, stayed in a hotel in LA, was booked on two separate flights from LAX (a morning flight to Salt Lake City and an evening direct to Reno), every time I tried to board the system freaked out because of the evening flight they didn't take me off of... and then when leaving and it was time to check in, my flight from Reno to LA had disappeared and I was cordially invited to checkin for my flight from LAX home -- with nothing to get me to LAX!  🤬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50% of the trips were reasonably good, even though they had delays, but the other 50% were really quite stressful.  Still, it was nice to see people in person and it was really nice to get to Red Hat's HQ in Raleigh again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel bad for those who got stuck over the holidays, and those who are still stuck as I write this, as we've had more airport insanity than we've had for some time and at such a large scale as well.  I'm not keen yet to go on holidays somewhere I can't drive to, such as when we went to Jasper this summer for a week which turned into two nights because of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjmyJazNFsA"&gt;Chetamon Wildfire&lt;/a&gt; that took out power to the townsite (and hence our cabin).  We made the right decision to leave after being without power for about 6h as it turned into a number of days without power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of disappointing holidays, revamping this blog over Christmas was probably the only highlight.  My daughter was sick with a stomach bug, my wife's uncle died on Boxing Day, and my mother-in-law went into the hospital Christmas Day with heart issues that we're hopeful the doctors are sorting out, although we expect her to be there for a few more days yet. Post-Christmas has been spent doing a lot of fretting and going to and from the hospital or to visit my father-in-law to make sure he's not too lonely.  Tragically, my daughter's boyfriend's mother passed away a week before Christmas as well, under some rather sad circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite the way I had wanted to end this year but at this point I can only consider it to be the icing on the cake of a truly terrible year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst for me, however, was my wife's health this year.  It's been another challenging year and a revisit of &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/2018-a-retrospective-resilience"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of the year she's been feeling poorly, and we're a bit stuck on how to make her body properly absorb iron because it seems as though it isn't.  She's been on iron pills for the last number of years, and I suspect that stress is a major trigger to &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in her body not working as it should.  At the beginning of this year we started the work to sell the acreage her parents lived on and move them into an assisted living facility that's located a little closer, and a significant amount of that effort was done by my wife.  In fact, she quit her job so she could focus on it, and that's when she started feeling poorly, almost -- but not quite -- as bad as in 2018 which, looking back, was likely triggered by other stressful family events.  We finally managed to get her a series of iron infusions this summer and her numbers were good, but she got her iron and hemoglobin levels tested three months after the infusion and the iron is low again, while the hemoglobin is still high.  But that will only last for so long with no iron to help produce red blood cells, so I expect she'll need another infusion soon.  Unless some of the help our naturopath is giving us works; we're trying different and additional iron now, along with a few other things, so we'll see in a month whether those iron levels have gone up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, from a work perspective, this was an incredibly challening yet rewarding year.  From a personal perspective, it was an incredibly challeninging and not so awesome year.  In fact, it's been probably one of the toughest since I've started writing these retrospectives.  Yet, we soldier on and take the good days and the bad as they come.  Next year will undoubtably come with its own challenges, although I'm optimistic that we'll finally get things sorted out with respect to my wife's health.  So we put our trust in God and pick ourselves up when we get knocked down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite proverbs is Proverbs 24:16: "&lt;em&gt;For a righteous man may fall seven times and rise again, But the wicked shall fall by calamity.&lt;/em&gt;" It's also a Japanese proverb: "七転び八起き" or "&lt;em&gt;Fall down seven times, stand up eight.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess there's a reason I got this tattooed on my hands a few years ago.  Sometimes it just comes down to reminding yourself that, no matter how tough things get, we always get to choose.  We can choose to lie down and feel sorry for ourselves, we can choose destructive paths that just end up making things worse, or we can choose to get up, dust ourselves, embrace hope, and move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: my mother-in-law was only in the hospital for a week and got
out before New Year's, which was great.  She seems to be doing much better
now on updated medication, had some really great nurses and doctors while
there, so definitely answered prayers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>...

&lt;p&gt;For a number of years, since getting more and more into management, I've
had less time to do any real programming.  So a highlight of the year, for
the first few years at least, was to take time during the Christmas break
to do some work, mostly on this blog …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/pelican-logo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a number of years, since getting more and more into management, I've
had less time to do any real programming.  So a highlight of the year, for
the first few years at least, was to take time during the Christmas break
to do some work, mostly on this blog and for a few other odd projects.  In 2016 I
wrote the platform for this site in Flask, migrating from WordPress (I
think? It's been so long I can't remember!).  At the time I was doing a lot
of work with Flask for work, building a dashboard for our vulnerability
management and incident response processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However in 2018, the demands on my time for work were less programming and
more leading, so the amount of code I was able to write became significantly
less.  And for the last few years it has been nearly non-existant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I talk to customers and others about the risk of updating software and
why an enterprise Linux vendor like Red Hat performs backporting of patches
(and why our customers love it), I often use this blog as an example.
&lt;em&gt;Every time&lt;/em&gt; I try to update python modules or dependencies, things
ultimately break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it had been two years since I did anything with the Flask application
that powered this site.  So a few days ago I spent the day upgrading Flask
and it's dependencies, which included a deprecated Flask-Security module
(so upgraded to Flask-Security-Too) and a whole host of dependencies.  After an entire
day's worth of effort, the site ran but I couldn't log in.  There were some
issues with the CSRF handling, where the tokens weren't matching and after
quite a few hours trying to figure it out I just gave up.  The example I'd
been using all year with customers just became a very real reality.  I had
updated my dependencies like a good security professional and a whole lot
of nothing worked (well, the site worked but no ability to add new
content, such as this blog post, which for me is a bit of a big deal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, yesterday, I was ready to roll up my sleeves and dive in
again when it struck me that the old site had a lot of fancy things I had
implemented because I was using it for work.  Well, that old work dashboard
is long gone and I'm no longer really working with Flask at all -- my
programming these days tends to be quick and dirty scripts to solve small
problems.  So I spent some time thinking, to figure out what I really needed
from this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I need comments?  Well not really, most of them are spam.  Do I need a
login?  Probably not, I'm the only author here.  Do I need something that
looks slick?  It'd be nice, but not necessary.  So rather than diving into
why Flask-Security-Too had become my number one enemy, I started looking
for static site generators and stumbled on &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/index.html"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is a pretty slick static site generator that uses RST or Markdown
as source content.  Pretty quickly I realized that the content here was
probably what was most interesting to people, not all the other
fancy-shmancy features that I had added.  So I decided to focus on the
content, in particular old arcticles I'd written (that still get a
ridiculous number of hits for things that are so old!) and the blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few hours I'd written a quick and dirty script to iterate through
the MySQL database and output a number of Markdown files for both articles
and blog posts, setup Pelican, and troubleshooted it quite a bit as I wanted
the links to blog posts and others to be consistent with the old site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look and feel is ok, it's not exactly what I wanted but it'll do for
now and I may monkey around with it later.  But the maintenance is
effectively zero.  I don't need all the fancy modules since it's not an
interactive site.  With it being 100% static, a lot of concerns about old
python modules, updating code when it breaks, and so forth is just plain
old &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels rather refreshing!  And this is the first post written for this
new site.  And with three days to Christmas, I'm humming the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QPQI5QUs74"&gt;twelve days of
Christmas&lt;/a&gt; but there's no partridge
around here... there's a Pelican in my pear tree ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>A new generation of tools for open source vulnerability management</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/a-new-generation-of-tools-for-open-source-vulnerability-management.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-18T07:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-12-18T07:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2022-12-18:/blog/a-new-generation-of-tools-for-open-source-vulnerability-management.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/cloud_tools_hardware.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first article written there and while the article itself tends to be vendor-agnostic, this truly is an article about Red Hat Product Security team's use of tooling for vulnerability management and the evolution of the same.  We went from no tools, to commandline tools that manipulated Bugzilla, to a monolithic web-based tool (that also manipulated Bugzilla) to a suite of discrete tools to handle vulnerability management with a proper database and proper front-end tools.  The reliance on Bugzilla was historical and we're really looking forward to getting rid of it as our "database" because it never should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you iterate and learn, and the thing I'm most excited about is these tools are now being developed in the open and can benefit others, which none of the earlier tools with their reliance on our modified Bugzilla could do.  So if you're interested in vulnerability response tooling, I'd encourage you to read the above article, checkout the linked github repos (noted below for convenience) and see if there is something you can use or contribute to! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/component-registry"&gt;Component Registry&lt;/a&gt;: which is used to store all of the component information across any number of products and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/osidb"&gt;OSIDB&lt;/a&gt;: the Open Security Issue Database, is the database to store all vulnerability data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/openlcs"&gt;OpenLCS&lt;/a&gt;: the Open License and Crypto Scanner, is the tool to obtain license and cryptography information from shipped components&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of this year I've been advocating for a risk-based vulnerability management approach, rather than the "industry standard" checkbox-based approach.  I've been talking to customers, both directly and at various events (such as Red Hat Summit in Boston, Red Hat Summit Connect in Dallas, directly with customers in Singapore …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/cves-on-fire.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For much of this year I've been advocating for a risk-based vulnerability management approach, rather than the "industry standard" checkbox-based approach.  I've been talking to customers, both directly and at various events (such as Red Hat Summit in Boston, Red Hat Summit Connect in Dallas, directly with customers in Singapore, and virtually with customers).  A few weeks ago I also published on the Red Hat Security blog: &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/do-all-vulnerabilities-really-matter"&gt;Do all vulnerabilities really matter?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gratifying thing is that I'm not alone!  Earlier this week I saw this article: &lt;a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/why-cve-management-as-a-primary-strategy-doesn-t-work"&gt;Why CVE Management as a Primary Strategy Doesn't Work&lt;/a&gt; which nicely dovetails with what I've been talking about, and a few months ago there was &lt;a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/open-source-software-bugs--attackability"&gt;Only 3% of Open Source Software Bugs Are Actually Attackable, Researchers Say&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given there is such a low exploitation rate, and also given there is such a high vulnerability rate that continues to grow YoY, one has to step back and ask oneself: do all of these matter?  Do we need to update all of them?  The answer is, generally, "no" yet it's a little more nuanced.  Sometimes it's hard to know which vulnerabilities will turn into something that we care about.  Yet there are some metrics we can look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/product-security-risk-report-detail#section-5"&gt;2021 Red Hat Product Security Risk Report&lt;/a&gt; we started reporting on known exploits and the data was enlightening.  For example, there was a 10% exploitation rate of Critical-rated vulnerabilities, a 2.5% exploitation rate of Important-rated vulnerabilities, and the numbers kept dropping... 1.7% for Moderate-rated and 0% for Low-rated.  Now, as time goes on those may edge a bit higher for Critical and Important vulnerabilities -- after all, we know that there are ancient vulnerabilities that are exploited years after they're made public (which is why patching these things is so critical!).  But few are exploited immediately.  So if we focus on those most likely to be exploited, and where a successful exploit would have the most damaging impact, focusing on fast fixing (and patching!) of Critical and Important (or High, as some call them) vulnerabilities makes the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's a really tiny number, overall.  Again, using the 2021 Red Hat Product Security Risk Report, there were 293 Critical and Important vulnerabilities, versus 1303 vulnerabilities rated Moderate and Low.  Fixing and patching 293 is a lot easier, for both producer and consumer, than fixing all 1596.  And these are just vulnerabilities that affect a shipping Red Hat product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do a bit of correlation here with data available from NVD.  Unfortunately I wanted to use the allitems.csv from MITRE to import into SQLite but it seems... well, it seems that the CSV file likes to have differing numbers of columns which breaks an easy import.  Hopefully future APIs will help, or the JSON format files like NVD does.  The APIs available from NVD won't help get these statistics either so I downloaded each of the JSON files.  And then because I don't get to nerd out and write much python these days, I created &lt;a href="https://github.com/vdanen/nvd-cve"&gt;nvd-cve on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; which will let me play around with some of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing to recognize is that, as per the NVD data, there has been steady growth in CVEs the last few years (big surprise!).  2021 had 10% YoY growth with a total of 20078 CVEs and thus far in 2022 we're at greater than 8% YoY with a total of 21733 CVEs published on NVD to-date.  That's a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of CVEs to fix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendors can try to keep up, at considerable expense in terms of time and energy.  That's a lot of patches to produce, and the picture is incomplete.  For example, this probably under-represents the number of vulnerabilities in open source because a lot of projects don't bother with getting CVEs assigned or don't know they fixed a security issue.  We know this &lt;strong&gt;vastly&lt;/strong&gt; under-represents proprietary software because they often don't bother labeling Low or Moderate (Medium) vulnerabilities as vulnerabilities and will either fix them silently or ignore them.  Having talked with a number of proprietary PSIRTs, I know this for fact.  And why not?  It's not as though anyone will find out, for the most part.  The beautiful transparency of open source allows for everything to be shown -- warts and all.  We can't hide it and we don't want to hide it, which is great news for consumers.  If a vendor doesn't apply a fix, but you know there's a vulnerability and it concerns you, you have the option to mitigate.  As they say, knowledge is power!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately with proprietary software, you don't have this knowledge and so don't have the power to mitigate on your own.  That's a benefit of open source, even though sometimes it makes things look uglier.  You can assess the risk in what you know -- it's not possible to assess the risk in what you don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave us?  Well, I've been working with open source for over 20 years so I'm obviously biased towards it.  With open source, you're not going to get all the fixes.  And honestly, you don't &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; all the fixes.  It's too expensive to test and patch for every single vulnerability discovered.  With that number going up, the cost will go up too.  Most people didn't start using open source to patch all the things... they got into open source because it provided value and increased the speed to delivery of whatever it is they're building &lt;strong&gt;on top of&lt;/strong&gt; that open source.  Yet, even though you won't get all the fixes, you do get all the information, and can mitigate on your own if you feel so inclined.  That's a benefit you don't get with proprietary software and one we shouldn't quickly forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet at the end of the day, no one wants to deal with CVE lists in the thousands where most of those vulnerabilities don't matter and honestly, whether you care to admit it or not, a lot of vulnerabilities out there aren't even on your little (or big!) list.  So why not do the sensible thing, set the list aside, and focus on the &lt;strong&gt;risk&lt;/strong&gt; of these vulnerabilities.  Critical and Important issues are most likely to be exploited, so concentrate there.  If a Moderate issue does get exploited (the risk of which is quite low and the risk of it causing significant damage even lower) then look to the vendor for a fix.  Typically they'll do the right thing and provide the fix without you having to ask.  That's because most vendors truly do want to protect their customers yet, at the end of the day, the software you're using isn't being used because it has no known vulnerabilities... it's being used to create value for you as a customer, and most likely your own customers further downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be clear, I do work for a software vendor and while the thoughts above are my own, they align with our approach.  We focus on the risky software that could potentially pose a threat to our customers.  You may also be interested in reading &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerability-management"&gt;An Open Approach to Vulnerability Management&lt;/a&gt; which we updated a month or so ago with more information on exploitable vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I took my first shake at some home-grown photo manipulation for fun.  The explosion came from &lt;a href="https://www.freepnglogos.com/pics/explosion"&gt;freepnglogos.com&lt;/a&gt; and the CVE screenshot is from the NVD site.  It's not really a checklist of CVEs to fix but you should get the drift...

It's an article that talks about supply chain risk and associated costs -- after all, no software is truly "free" (which is why we prefer the term open source to free software).  So where is that cost paid?  The article explores that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTUSCXNUvVE"&gt;video interview on open source and security&lt;/a&gt; I did with the fine folks at RedMonk last December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to use my "water treatment facility" analogy that I've been using internally at Red Hat for nearly a year now about what a supply chain looks like and the parallels between what we do for software being akin to what a water treatment facility does for, well, water.  The similarities are striking and ironic, given a few weeks after starting to use the analogy, the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/10/us/florida-water-poison-cyber/index.html"&gt;Florida water treatment hack&lt;/a&gt; was a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think, like many people, I did not expect to be writing this at the end of 2021 and still be in the COVID-19 pandemic.

&lt;p&gt;I think, like many people, I did not expect to be writing this at the end of 2021 and still be in the COVID-19 pandemic.  Simply to get it out of the way because COVID certainly wasn’t the most exciting thing this year, the entire family got COVID in the summer.  It wasn’t pleasant, but I’ve had worse.  Interestingly, that was when I had the flu in Boston shortly after Spectre/Meltdown was public.  Oh how our perceptions of working with sickness have changed in that short period of time.  Some good (let’s keep the hygiene up people!) and some bad (really really tired of masks and restrictions!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I had considered not writing this year and even considered taking the blog down in its entirety.. but by the looks of things, people still visit and find some useful information here (maybe not these retrospectives which are largely for myself) so I’ll keep it around.  Maybe I’ll retool it to be a static-only site given my time to write any code these days is slim to none.  And maybe I’ll post more too (yes, I know I’ve said that multiple times before!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of code, I’ve written some python code this year to do a little digging into the Google APIs, digging into calendar and mail data (such as how much time I spent in meetings, etc.).  A few months after writing that, Google added a feature to the calendar to tell you just that, so it feels like a bit of wasted effort but it was enjoyable nonetheless.  For the rest, most of the “code” I’ve written this year has been formulas in Google Spreadsheets.  Not quite as fun as python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a work perspective, this was a busy year.  Maybe the busiest, although I think I say that every year.  With the SolarWinds news at the beginning of the year we spent a lot of time and effort making sure our handling of the supply chain was good, and investing in making it more resilient.  That was top of mind for most of the year and we got quite involved there.  Of course there was the Executive Order around cybersecurity and that certainly caused some work to make sure we could meet those expectations, particularly around the Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) which I will state is quite disappointing when I read some of the expectations around SBOMs.  Many, particularly in the US government, seem to think the SBOM is a silver bullet for proper vulnerability management.  It’s certainly a part of the puzzle and required information, but not the panacea they seem to think and I strenuously object to the notion that an SBOM should have up to date vulnerability information contained within it.  Simply doesn’t make sense.  The SBOM is a list of ingredients – there are other ways of determining and correlating whether those ingredients are bad or, in a food services analogy, in need of recall.  You don’t print recall information on the packaging of your product.  So there is work to be done there and hopefully we, collectively, get this right or we’ll be producing and consuming SBOMs hourly (which, for a product like ??Red Hat Enterprise Linux, will be massive and wasteful to transfer and generate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this year we were able to add a number of new members to our awesome Product Security team.  I can’t stress enough how thankful and grateful I am for every member of the team.  Truly a top-notch crew.  Included were two new members to my direct staff, both of which were some of the best hires I ever managed.  From a personnel perspective, feeling really great being surrounded and supported by some amazing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I was promoted to Vice President of Product Security this year, which is a great recognition to the team (we’ve only ever had a Senior Director in the past).  So while this is nice for myself, I really see this as a promotion for the team and I’m so proud of them for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a personal perspective, the year was both exciting ?and boring.  We went to the mountains again this year, which is something we like to do each year, and it was amazing.  It felt really good to get away, even if it wasn’t as far as we wanted (we had planned to go to Scotland in 2020 so we’re still looking forward to that one day… maybe 2023?  Fingers crossed!).  But for the rest it was the same old “new normal” of being home bodies.  Which I don’t mind, to be honest, but I am definitely feeling itchy about wanting to travel again.  In fact, last night I was watching XXX (the Vin Diesel movie) and seeing the Czech countryside and Prague really made me miss Brno, so I'm definitely looking forward to being able to go again, hopefully sooner rather than later!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe I’ve mentioned before that my wife and I are marriage counselors.  We’ve, sadly, been quite busy this year.  There was some pre-marital counselling which is always fun, but a lot more of what we call “crisis” counselling this year…  about three times as much as last year even, which is probably the most counselling we’ve ever done.  So that was exhausting but rewarding for the most part.. They didn’t all have happy endings, but most of them did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife also changed jobs this year.  She had been working for the top-rated french bakery for the last 5 years but the owner closed it down.  Interestingly, when my wife served her notice that’s when she found out they were closing so she was there from beginning to end.  My waistline will probably thank me although I’m sad because I enjoyed those every-Friday treats from the bakery.  She’s now working at a not-for-profit operated by our church, in our own community, which is really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I noted in my retrospective for 2021, we lost my best furry buddy, Whiskeyjack, earlier this year.  But we got ourselves (and by “we” I mean my wife) a new little guy, a british shorthair, named Ted.  So we have two cats now: my daughter’s Herbert and my wife’s Ted.  The great thing is, for the first time in probably 30+ years, I’m no longer responsible for doing the kitty litter.  He’s a great companion, even if he does like to sleep between our pillows at night… which was cute when he was small but at a year old he’s now bigger than Herbert, who’s a year older than him.  He might get to over 15lbs (probably closer to 20lbs the way my wife feeds him!), so a big cat sleeping by my head…  Well, I preferred Whiskeyjack (who was by no means small) sleeping at my feet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this with one day left of my two weeks of PTO at the end of the year.  While it’s been a great time off, despite the obligatory Christmas cold, I’m stoked for 2022.  I’m hoping that COVID-19 will become either nothing or something we just deal with, without all of the extras.  I’m hoping to travel again this year; there are so many people in various locations that I’m looking forward to visiting again and connecting with – that has probably been the hardest thing about this pandemic, not being able to connect with co-workers in person.  There is nothing like breaking bread with the people you depend on.  And I’m looking forward to seeing what we can do in the security world – the team here at Red Hat have been working so hard, internally and externally, on doing the right thing not just for our customers but for the industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2021 was an interesting, but fulfilling, year.  I changed who I reported to, which is always interesting.  I think, even in the short term, it will be better for Product Security’s position within Red Hat so even though I was sad to change which organization Product Security sat in, I think this is the best thing moving forward.  The year closed out with a lot of analyst briefings about open source supply chain security, which is new to me.  I even did a talk at Red Hat NEXT, virtually, and I’m hoping to be able to do these in person soon.  I might even come to enjoy them ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>Linux and Cloud Native Security: Red Hat’s Perspective</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/linux-and-cloud-native-security-red-hats-perspective.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-07T13:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-11-07T13:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2021-11-07:/blog/linux-and-cloud-native-security-red-hats-perspective.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently interviewed by my friend Jack Wallen at the New Stack about Linux and cloud native security.

&lt;p&gt;It's taken me some time to even get to the place where I wanted to stop and think about 2020.  We're just over 2 months into 2021 and I've been thinking about writing this since December, but between being plain old tired (physically and mentally) and being busy, every time the thought of writing this came up I shied away, finding some excuse or another not to write it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But 2020 was too much of a year to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; write about it and this will be the fifth year that I look back on a former year and reflect on it.  Before it is too far in the rear view mirror... well, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 started off like any other recent year for me.  In the first 9 weeks I was in Boston twice and Raleigh once.  The pace was similar to prior years, until I was in Raleigh the first week of March for the FIRST PSIRT TC and I remember being in the hotel room in the evenings, watching the news as more cases of COVID-19 were appearing in North America and I distinctly remember: am I going to be able to make it home before they close the border?  I ended up getting home two weeks before the border between the US and Canada was closed.  After that, we went nowhere (like most everyone else).  The staff trip I was planning to host in Toronto in April was cancelled.  My wife and I were planning to visit Scotland - cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, 2020 was when they started working from home full time.  Not an issue for me, I've been working out of my home for 20 years -- not a big deal.  What I found strange that I did not expect, was not traveling anymore.  When I first started having to travel more for work, I didn't particularly enjoy it.  Immensely useful and I appreciated and valued meeting people in person and getting things done.  The value I got out of travel was great but the travel itself wasn't a highlight.  Oddly enough, I think I started enjoying it without even realizing it.  The first 6 months were weird -- I liked being at home with the family, but I missed the travel (heck, I even missed the flights, which I never thought I would miss!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was June before I put away my luggage and backpack, which I never put away due to the frequency of travel.  I think it wasn't until then that I thought we'd be in this for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this point, I wasn't really worried about myself or my family (aside from my parents and in-laws).  I'm fairly healthy, pretty hygiene conscious to begin with, and I have my faith to rest on.  So in that respect, COVID was more of a nuisance to me personally than anything else.  The part where I struggled was with the people in my Product Security team -- a team who is dispersed around the globe.  When things weren't bad here in Canada but were terrible in Spain, where I have some associates, I was concerned.  Every time news of new outbreaks, new lockdowns, new and terrible events around the world came up I was concerned for and praying for those I am responsible for in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, towards the end of the year, it felt that COVID was sucking the life out of me.  Again, not due to concerns for me or my family, but because of my concern for the team.  That is probably the worst thing because while I feel responsibility for these people, there's very little that I could do outside of work flexibility to accommodate their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw in general unrest around the world from "mostly peaceful protests" that burned down the livelihoods of innocent people to political issues.. the so-called "doom scrolling" of 2020 was a real thing.  Of course, this added to the stress as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then throw in the impact of lockdowns to the mental health and livelihoods of people.  I remember distinctly talking with my wife as we were going into our first lockdown that, impacts to the economy aside, the toll this would take on people unable to work or support their families or even get out to burn off some steam, was going to be high.  We're marriage counsellors in our church so this was a real concern for us because it did not bode well for families or marriages.  What would we be seeing?  What would the fallout truly be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, we've seen and counselled a number of people for whom 2020 was the straw that broke the camels back.  The number of separations and divorces, where forced proximity brought things to the surface that caused rupture were high.  We've seen people happily married for over a decade (or so we thought), split up.  We saw someone leave their spouse and children without even telling them before they were already 300km away.  Not personally, but in our province, we've seen men commit suicide because they could no longer take care of their families, kids commit suicide because they were out of school and the isolation was too much.  We've seen substance abuse get out of control, which meant overdoses at a scale we'd not seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 2020 brought out the absolute worst in a lot of people, we've also seen it bring some beautiful things.  We got to do premarital counselling for two wonderful couples.  We were able to bring couples together that were buckling under the strain of everything 2020 brought.  We've seen kindness for neighbours, people helping out others who couldn't help themselves.  If it wasn't for those beautiful things to balance out the ugly...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumstances like these really bring out what's under the surface.  These are times when our character is put in the crucible.  I love this analogy; when precious metal is put in the crucible and the heat is turned up, the impurities always rise to the surface.  They're visible to see.  Those inner parts that make us who we are come out -- and we all have impurities.  How we handle them I think speaks to inner strength and character.  Do we manage and get rid of the impurities as they come out when under extreme heat, or do we hang on to them and when things cool down they once more become a part of us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not by nature a patient person.  This has bubbled to the surface a lot in 2020.  I have been frustrated, angry, annoyed.  But when those emotions or impurities come up, I try to manage them and not keep them.  My hope and prayer for myself is, by the grace of God, I continue to become a better husband, father, manager, counsellor, pastor and friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before Christmas we thought we were going to lose my best fuzzy friend: Whiskeyjack, my faithful companion pictured above.  He was quite sick and losing a lot of weight and we'd seen this before in the other Maine Coons we had.  Thankfully he turned a corner and, while not 100% and still quite thin, we made it to mid-January of this year.  Unfortunately we did have to put him down then.  Silly as it sounds, I'm happy that 2020 didn't claim him.  It's claimed enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also grateful for my team -- 2020 was a year of intense pressure and we stayed the course and accomplished &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, despite what was going on in our lives personally.  If anyone in Product Security is reading this, you already know how grateful I am for each and every one of you but it bears repeating: thank you!  We accomplished a lot in the most trying of circumstances!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows what the future brings.  At this point we're well into 2021 and there's hope on the horizon.  Vaccines are slowly being made available and I hope that things continue to become more and more normal.  I look forward to being able to travel again.  I look forward to visiting offices and thanking people in person.  I look forward to breathing free.  I look forward to less doom-scrolling and more happy news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 is one year in our journey.  2021 may not be a lot better but perhaps the night is coming to a close and dawn is on the horizon.  The night always seems darkest before the dawn, so here's to hope that the near future -- if not fully realized in 2021 -- will be bright!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>Upgrading FreeNAS to TrueNAS Core</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/upgrading-freenas-to-truenas-core.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-22T18:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-12-22T18:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2020-12-22:/blog/upgrading-freenas-to-truenas-core.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/truenas.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given it's the holidays and that's when I tend to have time and energy to poke around the house, I decided to upgrade my FreeNAS box to the newer TrueNAS 12 release.  The upgrade itself went without a hitch, simply switching from the FreeNAS 11 train to the TrueNAS 12 train was sufficient.  However when everything came back, none of my jails started.  I have three jails that are used daily: plex, gitea, and inkdrop (which runs a CouchDB server for the Inkdrop note-taking tool &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/inkdrop-with-couchdb-on-freenas"&gt;I've detailed before&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting this here, as a followup to my earlier blog post about &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/updating-iocage-jails-in-freenas"&gt;updating iocage jails in FreeNAS&lt;/a&gt; was helpful but insufficient.  It might have been sufficient on any day other than today though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to start the jails in the TrueNAS UI yielded no real information as to why the jails weren't starting, so off to the trusty commandline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;inkdrop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;devfs_ruleset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;does&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;exist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;starting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;jail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not overly helpful, but some poking around led me to &lt;a href="https://github.com/iocage/iocage/issues/1140"&gt;this issue on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that described the problem I was having.  You could edit the &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; file directly, but iocage let's you use tooling for this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# sudo iocage get all inkdrop|grep dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;allow_mount_devfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;devfs_ruleset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;min_dyn_devfs_ruleset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mount_devfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# sudo iocage set devfs_ruleset=4 inkdrop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;devfs_ruleset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we set the devfs_ruleset to 4.  Why 4?  No idea, that's what the GitHub issue noted to set it to.  Also note that these were incremental; my plex server had a devfs_ruleset value of 5, gitea was 6, and inkdrop was 7 (incidentally the order in which they were created).  I set all of them to 4.  Now the jail starts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;iocage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;inkdrop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;No&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;gateway&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ipv6&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Starting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;inkdrop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Started&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;devfs_ruleset&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;iocage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;generated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Configuring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;VNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;vnet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Starting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Executing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;poststart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;192&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;168&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the jail started, I pulled in the FreeBSD 12.2-RELEASE with &lt;code&gt;iocage fetch&lt;/code&gt;.  And following previous instructions I had outlined wanted to do the upgrade.  Which &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have worked, except that the FreeBSD folks appear to be monkeying around with their git repos today!  Since I wanted to get this all done today rather than wait, I decided to do some more digging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;iocage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;inkdrop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;RELEASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Traceback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;most&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/local/bin/iocage&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Processing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;candidates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;77&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;candidates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;following&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;77&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;will&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;affected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems to be working well!  The web UI now shows the inkdrop jail running 12.2-RELEASE-p2 which is what I wanted.  Rinse and repeat for the other two jails.  Both of which worked just as well.  All in all, upgrading the jails took longer than upgrading from FreeNAS to TrueNAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far so good!  I still have to upgrade the ZFS pools, and FreeNAS (sorry, TrueNAS... will take some getting used to) also supports being an OpenVPN server which is something I've missed since I switched from pfSense to the Unifi USG.  I'll have to fiddle with that later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it wasn’t for the, hopefully transient, changes to the FreeBSD git repos it likely would have all been fine.  Judging by the GitHub issues, if I had done this last weekend it probably wouldn't have been an issue.  If you do opt to do like me, make sure you have a backup and probably take snapshots of your jails first so you can rollback if you have any problems (which, as I'm typing this, made me think that would have been a good idea that I neglected to do myself...).  I'll be fiddling with this new TrueNAS release over the next few days, but so far it seems pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also don't forget to revert the changes to &lt;code&gt;ioc_upgrade.py&lt;/code&gt; when you're done!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Bsd"></category><category term="freenas"></category><category term="truenas"></category></entry><entry><title>COVID-19 in Edmonton</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/covid-19-in-edmonton.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-07T19:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-11-07T19:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2020-11-07:/blog/covid-19-in-edmonton.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/covid.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Alberta government has some excellent visualizations about &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm"&gt;COVID-19 statistics in Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, I felt there was a little too much missing.  The province is quite transparent and you can export the data in CSV.  Since these days most of my "technical work" is dorking around in spreadsheets, I fiddled with the data a bit.  It's not quite to my liking because the data isn't complete.  For example it doesn't tell you when a person with COVID had it detected and when they recovered so we can't see the average length to recovery, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was more interested in my own city so sliced out the data to just focus on Edmonton.  The chart below is ok and updated as I update (which depends on when I get around to it and when their data set is updated).  Unfortunately due to how they publish I can't automate it like I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may fiddle a bit with some Python to do some more interesting digging with the data, but I'm not sure how much further I can get with the limited data available.&lt;/p&gt;

All I know is it's not getting better and folks need to exercise a bit more communal responsibility.   As the Premier and Chief Medical Officer of Health have said numerous times, COVID-19 isn't something to be afraid of, but it is something to respect.  Alberta did a great job over the summer and I expect it lulled us into a false sense of security which is why we're seeing things get worse.  Having said that, our numbers are not insanely high like other places around the world, for which I'm grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping everyone is staying safe, practicing communal responsibility, and staying healthy!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Interview about CVSS</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/interview-about-cvss.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-09T18:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-06-09T18:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2020-06-09:/blog/interview-about-cvss.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently interviewed by my friend Jack Wallen (whom I've known for 20 years as he actually coerced me to start writing for TechRepublic &lt;em&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; ago!).

It was about a topic near and dear to my heart: CVSS (or Common Vulnerability Scoring System).  With the explosion of security scanning vendors, particularly around containers, the reliance and misunderstanding of CVSS has been a thorn in my side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't often blog about challenges at work or in the security industry, but I had considered writing about CVSS and some deficiencies around it (I may yet still do so).  When Jack reached out to Red Hat to be interviewed, I jumped at the opportunity because it's an important topic and because I could trust Jack not to twist or sensationalize what I had to say.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important topic, irrespective of who is talking about it.  There is &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; wrong with the way CVSS is being used today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had someone at our home to look at replacing the front and back doors.  The rep for the company was exceptionally personable and we probably spent more time with him than the simple transaction of selecting and ordering new doors for our home warranted, but my wife and I are "people" people so we enjoyed the conversation and engaged with this young man.  He told us about his life, how he came to Canada by way of Israel and originally from Russia.  How his first main job here was actually working immigrations to make it easier for people to come to Canada than it was for him (a bit of a shocker in how long it took and how much it cost, to be honest) and how he rather randomly ended up as a rep for a door and window installer.  It was rather fascinating to learn more about how he got here, how we viewed Canada coming from both Israel and Russia, and how he feels his life is improved living here (another reminder of why I'm a grateful Canadian!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was interesting though was last night, after my daughter's new super-energized kitten (Herbert) went to bed and I could enjoy a glass of wine in peace without our new feline Edward Scissorhands taking to my legs, I began to think about my own career journey and what got me here and, as I'm sure many folks randomly do every once in a while, I stalked myself online to get a sense of history that under normal circumstances I wouldn't normally think about or remember without prompting.  Apparently I am so full of "today" stuff that I forgot about the "what got me here" stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with a search for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?cirrusUserTesting=glent_m0&amp;amp;search=vincent+danen&amp;amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;amp;go=Go&amp;amp;ns0=1"&gt;my name&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-focused_operating_system#Annvix"&gt;Annvix&lt;/a&gt; on wikipedia.  Not a lot there, but it did remind me that I had devoted 5 years of my life to a security-focused Linux distribution based on Mandriva, the last version of which was released over 12 years ago.  I actually had no idea that it had been reviewed on &lt;a href="https://www.linux.com/news/annvix-stable-secure-no-frills-server-distro/"&gt;linux.com&lt;/a&gt; probably a few months after the last stable release and a few months before I decided to call it quits with my last commit on April 10 2008 to 3.1-CURRENT (last stable release was 3.0-RELEASE on Feb 3 2008), so it was interesting to find a review on it over a decade later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I think one of the Sun Fire X4100 machines in my rack still has Annvix installed on it and I bet if I fired it up it would boot... with no idea of what the passwords might be!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the other references on wikipedia were to articles I had written for TechRepublic.  When I looked, there were &lt;a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/search/?q=%22vincent+danen%22"&gt;28 pages consisting of 286 results&lt;/a&gt;, with articles from Feb 2000 to June 2011, mostly Linux-related but the last few years had a bunch of Mac-related articles as well.  Looking through the list of things I wrote about was a definite trip down memory lane, as I used my writing for TechRepublic as an excuse to learn about new software so that I could write about it.  Anything that looked interesting merited a review or how-to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinciding with that, I also stumbled across a &lt;a href="http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/9986/index.html"&gt;joint Debian, Mandrakesoft, Red Hat, and SUSE response to a Forrester Research report&lt;/a&gt; that claimed Microsoft Windows was more secure than Linux, which was also noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2563965/linux-vendors-claim-forrester-report-favored-microsoft.html"&gt;ComputerWorld article&lt;/a&gt;, back in 2004.  Sadly, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Is+Linux+more+Secure+than+Windows%3F%22+2004&amp;amp;oq=%22Is+Linux+more+Secure+than+Windows%3F%22+2004"&gt;despite looking&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn't find the original report, just a number of articles discussing it.  The Forrester Research site only appears to retain reports back to 2006, otherwise I would link to the original report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never would have guessed in 2004, when I co-wrote that statement with Mark Cox at Red Hat, that he would end up being my boss 5 years later when I left Mandriva for Red Hat in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when I started writing for TechRepublic, I was a volunteer packager for Linux-Mandrake (at the time) -- akin to a Fedora contributor today.  I quit my job (in bill collections) and started my own consulting company, predominantly writing for TechRepublic and a few other sites, and it was that period of volunteering and writing that got me the gig at Mandrakesoft, as a documentation writer and packager (by invitation, I never applied for a job).  It wasn't until about a year later that I started doing the security work at Mandrakesoft, preparing updates for users of Linux-Mandrake to correct the (then-rare) security vulnerabilities in our products.  At this point in time I had pretty much zero security skills and, as security in software slowly came to the fore emerging as something we really needed to pay attention to, I did all of my learning on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth pointing out that, at Mandrakesoft, I was the sole member of our security team for most of that time.  We didn't have an incident response process or tools to handle security updates.  Much of what we did was modelled after what Red Hat was doing (we started using CVE names shortly after Red Hat did, our errata (MDKSA) was similar to Red Hat's RHSA, etc.  I built the program and everything around it.  Unlike Red Hat where we have Engineering write patches and build software, Release Engineering to release the software to customers, and QE to quality test, the entire process was handled and driven by one person --- I found out about the issues, backported the patches, tested the packages, and used my own self-written toolchain to publish the advisories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward seven years of running and managing the small security team (PSIRT, but we didn't call it such back then) at Mandriva (formerly Mandrakesoft) I made the leap to join Red Hat in February 2009 as a Senior Software Engineer as part of the Security Response Team (now known as Product Security).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Red Hat, for the first 5 years I spent my time doing vulnerability analysis before becoming a manager in late 2014, where I remained as a manager (of a few different functions in Product Security) until late 2017 when I assumed the leadership of our entire Product Security team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in 1998 when I was first introduced to and started to use Linux, 22 years ago.  Half of my life has been spent working on open source and being part of the open source ecosystem.  I've ended up in a position that I didn't even dream was possible 22 years ago and, if I'm honest, wasn't anything I ever aspired to.  This wasn't even a proverbial twinkle in my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why write a blog post about this?  Well, like my new friend who will be installing doors in my home in a few months, I've had a very interesting and rather unorthodox career journey.  Grit, hard work, getting involved and putting in the extra mile (or ten) got me to where I am today.  Yes, unorthodox.  Yes, unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today's world where we have a huge cybersecurity skills shortage, I don't think my story is unique.  At least, I hope it isn't.  And, if it is, it needs to not be unique.  There are a number of people who found their way into security by means of "accident", "happenstance", or "divine intervention" (I attribute it to the latter).  I get frustrated when I see people on Twitter who are smart and begging for a chance to get into the security field to be sidelined by lack of certifications or training.  If I could hire you all I would!  I believe security is something you can train and teach, if you have sufficient technical proficiency and, most importantly, and insatiable curiosity to understand and break things, or what I call "the spark".  I learned security on-the-job.  When I started at Mandrakesoft, it wasn't with security certifications and experience.  I learned on the job because someone suckered me into the "one to two updates a month" job of taking on security updates.  If I had a team to support me and teach me, maybe things would have moved faster.  Who knows?  The point is that we, as security practitioners who are looking for people to hire, have to accept the fact that there is more work than there are "qualified" people.  And that's ok!  Because there are a lot of curious and smart people out there without degrees and CISSPs and other certifications that we can &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt; and grow into amazing security people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if their career journey is unexpected because someone took a chance on them, I say good for the company willing to take that chance.  After all, my career journey was entirely unexpected and turned out better than I could have expected.  I suspect the same will be said of many in the next 22 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a terrible memory, which means that I rely on a lot of tools and methodologies (like GTD, Getting Things Done) to help me track things.  This also means that I have a lot of different tools ,and I regularly re-evaluate and change them if something new can meet my ever-changing needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last two years I've been using &lt;a href="https://happenapps.com/"&gt;Quiver&lt;/a&gt; to categorize and keep notes.  These are notes for myself of people, projects, interesting things, escalations, etc.  These are also notes on nearly every meeting I attend.  For obvious reasons, these are sensitive and need to be kept under my own control.  Prior to Quiver, I was using &lt;a href="https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/"&gt;EagleFiler&lt;/a&gt; (incidentally, I still use EagleFiler, just not for note keeping -- it's a great way to organize and collect files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Quiver worked quite well, it has limitations.  As I try to do more work from my iPad rather than my laptop, the companion Quiver iOS app was showing it's limitations.  I could share the notes via my own internal WebDAV server, but it was read-only.  That is great if I only want a reference, but to fully move to my iPad for the "normal day to day" stuff I needed something where I could review and edit notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came across &lt;a href="https://inkdrop.app/"&gt;Inkdrop&lt;/a&gt; which is a note-taking application similar to Quiver with a more robust set of features, including iOS applications that will edit, and a better way of synchronizing those notes.  While Inkdrop does provide a server to store the data (which is no good for me since I want to retain full control of my data), it does allow you to use a local CouchDB server.  It also has a subscription of $5/mo which, if it can do what I need it to do, is worth it to me (particularly with the travel I've been doing of late).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things for me were standing up a CouchDB server (never played with it before) and being able to convert my Quiver library into a format that Inkdrop can use.  Fortunately, both Quiver and Inkdrop use JSON files for the metadata so with a little bit of elbow grease I figured I could make it work.  This post covers a few things: standing up the CouchDB server, getting Inkdrop to sync to it, and finally converting the data I already had in Quiver (nearly 1800 notes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CouchDB in a FreeNAS jail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to create the FreeNAS jail in which I was going to run CouchDB.  This needed to be running on my local network and not accessible to the internet.  It also needed to use HTTPS.  The first step was to create a new jail named &lt;code&gt;inkdrop&lt;/code&gt; in FreeNAS (using the web UI).  Once that was done, I logged into the FreeNAS server, entered the jail, and installed the &lt;code&gt;pkg&lt;/code&gt; tool to install what I needed for CouchDB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo iocage console inkdrop
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pkg&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pkg install couchdb2 curl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# cd /usr/local/etc/couchdb2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# vi local.ini&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we need to assign the admin user a password and note it in the &lt;em&gt;local.ini&lt;/em&gt; file.  There are other files to edit as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# vi vm.args
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;vm.args&lt;/em&gt;, change the &lt;code&gt;setcookie&lt;/code&gt; option from its default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# vi /etc/rc.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;rc.conf&lt;/em&gt; set &lt;code&gt;coudchdb2_enable&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;.  Now we can start the service and initialize our database.  The database will be named &lt;code&gt;inkdrop&lt;/code&gt; and the admin user's password is &lt;strong&gt;passwd&lt;/strong&gt; in the following examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# service couchdb2 start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X PUT http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_users&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X PUT http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_replicator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X PUT http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_global_changes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X PUT http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/inkdrop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install nginx as the CouchDB proxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to use nginx as the proxy for CouchDB so that we can have HTTPS requests rather than HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# pkg install nginx
# cd /usr/local/etc/nginx
# vi nginx.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you want to follow the &lt;a href="https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/synchronizing-in-the-cloud/#how-to-set-up-your-own-sync-server"&gt;Inkdrop instructions for setting up your own sync server&lt;/a&gt;.  That should get nginx nicely configured.  The next step is to use Let's Encrypt in the FreeNAS jail.  I've blogged about this in the past here, with &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/using-letsencrypt-on-freenas"&gt;Using LetsEncrypt on FreeNAS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/using-letsencrypt-with-plex"&gt;Using LetsEncrypt with Plex&lt;/a&gt; so I won't go into a lot of detail, but will simply note the commands used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pkg install git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# cd /root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# git clone https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh.git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# cd acme.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ./acme.sh --install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# cd /root/.acme.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# export CF_Key=&amp;quot;api_key&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# export CF_Email=&amp;quot;email_addr&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ./acme.sh --issue --dns dns_cf -d inkdrop.hostname --fullchain-file /usr/local/etc/nginx/fullchain.pem --key-file /usr/local/etc/nginx/privkey.pem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# crontab -l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/root/.acme.sh&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;acme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/root/.acme.sh&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb nb-Type"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our SSL certificate setup and making sure the cronjob is set as well, we can now start nginx and test if we can connect to our CouchDB server over HTTPS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# vi /etc/rc.conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# service nginx start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X GET https:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//127.0.0.1:6984/_all_dbs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;error&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;unauthorized&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;reason&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;You are not a server admin.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X GET https:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:6984/_all_dbs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;_global_changes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;_replicator&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;_users&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;inkdrop&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;rc.conf&lt;/em&gt; you want to set &lt;code&gt;nginx_enable&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you intend to use Inkdrop on your mobile device, you now need to create the mobile design document as per &lt;a href="https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/synchronizing-in-the-cloud/#support-mobile-sync"&gt;Inkdrop's mobile sync documentation&lt;/a&gt;, which is effectively running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# curl -X PUT https:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:6984/inkdrop -d &amp;#39;{ &amp;quot;_id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;_design/mobile&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;filters&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;sync&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;function (doc) { return doc._id.indexOf(&amp;#39;file:&amp;#39;) === -1 }&amp;quot; } }&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mobile Sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you should have a fully functional CouchDB running behind nginx in a FreeNAS jail.  Now you can point Inkdrop to your server for syncing.  You can set this up to be accessible from anywhere, or you can leave it accessible only internally.  That's the way I chose to do it since you can edit documents while disconnected and it will sync back to the server when the client is able to connect.  This allows for complete privacy by not making it available outside of your own network, but makes it portable enough that you can take your notes with you so you can add and edit as you're out and about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that would make this even better for me would be for Inkdrop to have PIN or TouchID/FaceID protection on the mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Converting from Quiver to Inkdrop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you're like me and you've used Quiver in the past, there is good news!  You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; convert from Quiver to Inkdrop.  I had to scratch my own itch here as there was no conversion tool available.  Thankfully, Quiver uses JSON files that can be parsed and, for Inkdrop, I can talk directly to the CouchDB server.  Because of this I could see the content/format of what I had in Quiver, and what Inkdrop expected in CouchDB.  It wasn't terribly difficult to figure out, just took a bit of trial and error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My script for the conversion is available on GitHub: &lt;a href="https://github.com/vdanen/quiver-to-inkdrop"&gt;quiver-to-inkdrop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a nice amusement for me, to be honest.  I always enjoy playing with new software, something I don't get to do as often as I used to (when I wrote for TechRepublic years ago I was playing with new things all the time).  Everything here aside from FreeNAS was new for me and I'd never played with CouchDB before, and I always enjoy doing a bit of Python and hacking things to make them work.  Hopefully there is something interesting or useful here for others to use as well!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="freenas"></category><category term="couchdb"></category><category term="inkdrop"></category></entry><entry><title>Updating iocage jails in FreeNAS</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/updating-iocage-jails-in-freenas.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-17T19:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-02-17T19:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2020-02-17:/blog/updating-iocage-jails-in-freenas.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/freenas.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running FreeNAS as a file and application server for quite a while and love it.  The FreeBSD jails are awesome for running applications like Plex or gitea in isolation.  Recently the base FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE went end of life and 11.3-RELEASE was the new stable version (actually …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/freenas.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running FreeNAS as a file and application server for quite a while and love it.  The FreeBSD jails are awesome for running applications like Plex or gitea in isolation.  Recently the base FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE went end of life and 11.3-RELEASE was the new stable version (actually, it went EOL last October but I only realized it the other day).  Updates for packages can still be done within the jails, but upgrading the base jail can't be done from within the jail itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions are around on how to do it, however I like blogging things that I know I'll be coming back to and "consumer 1" for this blog is me.  If you're looking for a quick tutorial on how to upgrade the base jail on FreeNAS, then this may be of use to you.  Undoubtably it will be useful to future me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as of the current FreeNAS 11.3-RELEASE this cannot be done in the GUI, so we need to resort to the shell.  Open a console or ssh into your FreeNAS server, to an account with sudo privileges, and get a list of jails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;$ sudo iocage list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;Password:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+-----+-------------+-------+--------------+------+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;| JID |    NAME     | STATE |   RELEASE    | IP4  |&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;=====&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;=============&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;=======&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;==============&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;======&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;| 2   | gitea       | up    | 11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;RELEASE | DHCP |&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+-----+-------------+-------+--------------+------+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;| 3   | inkdrop     | up    | 11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;RELEASE | DHCP |&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+-----+-------------+-------+--------------+------+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;| &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;   | openproject | down  | 11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;RELEASE | DHCP |&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+-----+-------------+-------+--------------+------+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;| 1   | plex        | up    | 11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;RELEASE | DHCP |&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;+-----+-------------+-------+--------------+------+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my system. the plex, gitea, and openproject jails were created quite some time ago and are running the 11.2-RELEASE version of FreeBSD.  The inkdrop jail was created recently using the 11.3-RELEASE template.  We'll upgrade the openproject jail first since that one means less to me than plex or gitea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to make sure it is at the latest patch release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iocage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;openproject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Snapshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iocage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;jails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;openproject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ioc_update_11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RELEASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p15_2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;created&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Updating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;jail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Updating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;openproject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;installed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;skipped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Looking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mirrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mirrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I did this first, update it looked like it created a snapshot.  I don't know if this is a feature or not (or I did something by accident?), but either way it's a good idea to make sure you have a current snapshot.  You can examine whether or not that is the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;$ sudo iocage snaplist openproject&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do see your snapshots are out of date, you can create one using &lt;code&gt;sudo iocage snapshot openproject&lt;/code&gt;.  It also appears that it creates a snapshot as part of the upgrade, but I personally wouldn't rely on the good will of computers and would create a snapshot anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshots look current so we'll go ahead and do the upgrade to the new version.  This will take about 10 minutes and may interactively ask you to do things like merge or edit configuration files.  I note this not because it asked me for any of the three systems I upgraded, but because I had read elsewhere that it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output below is trimmed but you should get a sense of what to expect.  You need to specify the version to upgrade to (&lt;code&gt;11.3-RELEASE&lt;/code&gt;) and the jail name (&lt;code&gt;openproject&lt;/code&gt; in this case).  When you're asked about the the components that appear to be installed or not, and are asked whether it looks reasonable, answer &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to continue (to be honest, I have no idea but it seemed reasonable enough to me!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iocage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;11.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RELEASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;openproject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;installed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;skipped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Installing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;updates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;openproject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upgraded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;11.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RELEASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;11.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RELEASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this is done, enter the jail using &lt;code&gt;sudo iocage console openproject&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;pkg update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pkg upgrade&lt;/code&gt; to upgrade all of the packages inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you can use &lt;code&gt;sudo iocage list&lt;/code&gt; to verify the release is as expected as well, or use the web UI to verify.  That's pretty much all there is to it.  Everything should work properly.  I successfully did this with all three jails with a minimum of fuss.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Bsd"></category><category term="freenas"></category></entry><entry><title>2019: A Retrospective - Grit</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/2019-a-retrospective-grit.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-02T18:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-01-02T18:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2020-01-02:/blog/2019-a-retrospective-grit.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/grit-success-workthrough-it.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed reading (and writing) these annual retrospectives.  This will be the fourth that I've written.  There are two recurring themes I read from the past retrospectives: &lt;em&gt;tough&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;.  Life is tough -- be that in work or personal life.  But there is hope.

&lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed reading (and writing) these annual retrospectives.  This will be the fourth that I've written.  There are two recurring themes I read from the past retrospectives: &lt;em&gt;tough&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;.  Life is tough -- be that in work or personal life.  But there is hope.  Every year I look back and see how much was painful and hard and yet, at the end of each year, I see the accomplishments.  The things that made &lt;em&gt;tough&lt;/em&gt; worth it.  The things that make me hopeful come the next time I write one of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 was no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like every year I say this was the toughest year.  Then the next year I say "no, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; was the toughest year!"  Will I say the same thing again?  Probably!  What I'm coming to see is that as we grow and look back and experience new things, it's always harder.  As we move forward, as we accomplish more, there is more adversity to conquer.  There is more growth to experience.  There is always &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; that we strive for and in that striving comes cost and sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we say about this year?  We'll start on the work side of things.  When I look at what was accomplished at work, I'm honestly blown away.  This was my first year of really feeling settled in the role I unexpectedly found myself in just over a year ago.  Last year was hard because I felt like I was treading water just figuring out how to lead the team -- no training, no instruction, just expectations.  It's like learning anything new: riding a bike or surfing.  There was a lot of unsteady riding, a lot of figuring out how to keep balance.  I remember teaching my daughter how to ride a bike -- there was a helmet, training wheels, a bike her size.  As she grew more confident the training wheels came off but those first few "solo" rides saw me running behind her hanging on to the bike to keep it balanced.  And then she was riding free, all on her own using her own muscles and her own skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was like a kid learning to ride an adult bike with no training wheels, no helmet, and no parent hanging on to the back to keep me upright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 was not mastering the ride, but remaining upright more often than not, catching my balance, falling and dusting myself off and getting back on and riding for all I was worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it isn't about how much I stayed balanced on the bike, pedalling like a crazy person.  It was about how many times I fell off the bike and chose to get back on and keep going.  It's for that reason that my word for this year is &lt;em&gt;grit&lt;/em&gt;.  Because without a huge dose of grit I don't think I would have gotten back on the bike as many times as I did, or went as far on it as I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't get into all the details of what I accomplished at work, but suffice it to say there was a lot!  I hope my team, who had the opportunity to live through and hopefully experience the benefits of those things, would agree that we did a lot in 2019 that we'd never done before and there was a lot of change made.  A lot of "back to basics" to reset some things, some pivoting, some chasing of new things that have profound impact on not just us but our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back I feel really good about what was accomplished this year, even if there were some mishaps.  I also feel good about finishing ALDP (Advanced Leadership Development Program), which consumed a lot of time and effort for the first 6 months of the year.  Graduating that program was, to me, a huge benefit.  Not for my career, although there is that, but for me personally.  I learned a lot about myself through that program that I might not have learned otherwise.  When you're stretched to the point where you're ready to snap -- yet stay held together -- you learn a lot about what your capacity is, about the load you can bear... even if just for a time (and I certainly wouldn't recommend doing it for a prolonged period of time!).  One of the things I appreciate about Red Hat is the investment in people -- growing and stretching leaders in hugely positive ways so that we can take what we learn to then grow and stretch those we are responsible for.  Our whole point as leaders is to grow and build people, so programs like this are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midway through the year we got our new "parents in blue" and I don't have much to say about that aside from it made things feel different and challenging at a meta level.  The day-to-day didn't change, at least not for me or my team, but the feeling of no longer being masters of our own destiny was there.  Whether this is an accurate statement or just a feeling remains to be seen... I'm well aware that feelings are often wrong so, as they say, the proof is in the pudding.  I did get a chance to meet with the IBM PSIRT in person which was cool and I think they're a great crew.  We'll see what that means for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the personal side of things.... well, life continues to be messy.  The health challenges my wife was facing last October are unfortunately back again and we still have no answers.  But now we recognize the symptoms and can manage them even if we don't yet know the underlying cause.  Hopefully we will have answers soon this time around.  Honestly, the last year with her has been a gift because I know that without God's intervention she would have died a year ago.  It is a bonafide miracle that she was around this year, and I'm immensely grateful for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter became an adult this year which has proven to be interesting.  All the things the father of a daughter knows is coming are here now -- she is her own person and making her own way in the world.  I only hope I did a good enough job!  She's shown a lot of grit this year in her own way and while she didn't do everything the way I would have or wanted her to (makes sense, she is her own person), she's done pretty good.  Especially the last few months of her schooling, I've seen her adapt to the new realities of adulthood and I couldn't be prouder.  2020 will be a good year for her, I think, as she's getting out the gate well and really wants to do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's even reading David Allen's GTD book which is pretty astonishing =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I've done far too much traveling this year.  Again.  I've been to NC twice, Boston three times, Atlanta, Victoria, to the Czech, Israel, and Australia.  I actually obtained status with Air Canada which is a bit mind blowing.  2020 is shaping up to be more of the same.  The nice thing about having an adult child is that my wife will be able to come with me on some of these trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, 2019 was hard -- lots of challenges, lots of new things, and a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of blood, sweat, and tears.  But here at the beginning of 2020, I'm grateful because through adversity you find where your true strength lies.  And when you've found it, and you know it exists, it is something you can always lean on and it will always serve you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a final note, years ago I read the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  One of the main things I pulled from that book was to create a set of personal guiding principles, a personal mission statement, that serves as a compass for everything you do.  I cannot stress enough how invaluable an exercise like this is.  Every circumstance, choice and decision has to stand the test of alignment to that compass.  When you have a thousand things coming at you a thousand different ways, having that compass to steer you to your True North is beyond valuable -- it's absolutely critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created the personal mission statement, and then because I'm both a nerd and a Christian, I aligned them to verses from the Bible because I knew that if they were the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; things to have, I would find substance to support them in the Bible.  I've had this for years and I'm not sure whether I shared it before.  I'll share it now as an example of what is my personal mission statement and, perhaps, this may inspire some to figure out what their own compass is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus Christ is first in all things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek and merit divine help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never compromise honesty or integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitate the success of those who work with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen twice as much as I speak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money is my servant, not my master&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be generous with my time and money to those in need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take an honest interest in the people around me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always believe the best in and about others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be courageous in the face of obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never give up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With God's help, be the best husband and father that I can be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain disciple and properly manage my time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control my emotions, never let them control me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers, and my hope and prayer is that everyone who reads this has an &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; 2020 of learning, growing, and developing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>Replacing pfSense with a Unifi Security Gateway</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/replacing-pfsense-with-a-unifi-security-gateway.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-25T15:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-12-25T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2019-12-25:/blog/replacing-pfsense-with-a-unifi-security-gateway.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/usg-pro4-hero-mobile-01-2x.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a Unifi Security Gateway for over a year now but never had the time or patience to make it work properly.  Turns out my ISP &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; likes to cache MAC addresses so getting the USG to present the pfSense MAC address solved the problem pretty quick.  The rest …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/usg-pro4-hero-mobile-01-2x.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a Unifi Security Gateway for over a year now but never had the time or patience to make it work properly.  Turns out my ISP &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; likes to cache MAC addresses so getting the USG to present the pfSense MAC address solved the problem pretty quick.  The rest of my gear is all Unifi (48 port switch, 3 APs, Cloud Key Gen 2, 4 video cameras) and I love it.  Probably the most reliable network gear I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of the USG is a bit of a PITA though and finding information is hard because they have &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; networking gear out there and it seems they're all configured in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will share the two important things I needed: first, how to change the MAC address for the WAN1 port and secondly, restoring similar behaviour to pfSense's pfBlockerNG utility which blocks all ad-serving systems by replacing their IP address with 0.0.0.0.  Reading a page on macworld.com this morning on my phone made me really sad because of all the ads.  I do some surfing outside my home network, rarely... mostly I notice that the weather network app has ads when I'm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; home that aren't present when I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; home.  But loading that page this morning was an intolerable regression from what I'm accustomed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Custom MAC address&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I needed to do to get my USG to even talk to the internet and this is what stumped me the few times I had tried before.  I probably would have figured it out sooner if I'd had more time and/or patience.  At any rate, you need to create a &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/unifi/data/sites/default/config.gateway.json&lt;/code&gt; file with contents similar to the following (assuming you're using the Cloud Key; if you run the controller software on a different system you'll have to find the right spot):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    &amp;quot;interfaces&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;ethernet&amp;quot;: {
            &amp;quot;eth2&amp;quot;: {
                &amp;quot;mac&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;00:00:00:00:00:00&amp;quot;
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change that MAC address to whatever you need it to be.  Depending on the port, &lt;code&gt;eth2&lt;/code&gt; may not be correct.  On my USG 4 Pro, eth2 is the WAN1 port which is what is connected to my cable modem.  eth0 is LAN1.  Note that this &lt;code&gt;config.gateway.json&lt;/code&gt; file goes on the Cloud Key and once there you need to force-provision the USG and it will get copied over to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ssh into the USG and double-check by grepping for that interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@ubnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;eth2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ether&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;brd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;inet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;brd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;255.255.255.255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;eth2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it shows your external IP (1.1.1.1 in the above) and the right MAC address (00:00:00:00:00:00 in the above) then you're good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;pfBlockerNG-like ad blocking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is easy enough and the credit comes from this article: &lt;a href="https://medium.com/server-guides/how-to-integrate-ad-blocking-using-a-unifi-usg-a165dc2233c1"&gt;How to integrate ad blocking using a Unifi USG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the instructions from there, but the &lt;code&gt;update-adblock-dnsmasq.sh&lt;/code&gt; script I'll include below has been updated to suit me better.   For one, it's using an old URL for the block list.  Secondly, I don't like the idea of calling out to the internet with curl as root so I changed that.  Finally, I also made sure it validates the dnsmasq configuration before it restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# original writeup: https://medium.com/server-guides/how-to-integrate-ad-blocking-using-a-unifi-usg-a165dc2233c1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# note this script needs to run as root, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean everything&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# has to run as root&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;whoami&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; !&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Script must be run as root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; -f &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;temp_ad_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    sed -i -e &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/googleadservices\.com/d&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;temp_ad_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    chmod &lt;span class="m"&gt;644&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ad_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Error building the ad list, please try again.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;

rm -f &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;temp_ad_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# before restarting, test the validation so we can remove the ad file if&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# it&amp;#39;s going to cause problems&lt;/span&gt;

    /etc/init.d/dnsmasq force-reload
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    rm -f &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ad_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Removing ad configuration due to validation errors&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the article notes, this should be placed in &lt;code&gt;/config/user-data/&lt;/code&gt; where you can run it the first time using &lt;code&gt;sudo sh -x update-adblock-dnsmasq.sh&lt;/code&gt; so you can see what it does and if it spits out any errors.  When that's done, I added it to root's crontab: &lt;code&gt;sudo crontab -e&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@ubnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;crontab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;opt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unifi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getsig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;adblock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final question is why change from pfSense to USG?  Honestly, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; pfSense.  It is one of the best firewalls out there and arguably better than the USG.  But the USG ties in so nicely with the UI and dashboards with the rest of my Unifi gear.  With the USG I can get deep packet inspection and threat monitoring and it's all in one spot.  Yeah, I can get a lot of the same with pfSense but it's disjointed and as I'm getting, ahem, older and with much less time on my hands (as evident through the fact that I really only blog around Christmas and my other times off!) I don't want to fiddle as much.  My fiddle time is reserved for LEGO these days =) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, now that I have this thing working more or less the way that I want to, I'm sure I'll be making more time to fiddle... at least in the next week and a half!  Hopefully this is helpful to others thinking about either switching or standing up a USG of their own.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="dnsmasq"></category><category term="pfsense"></category><category term="usg"></category></entry><entry><title>Replaced GPG key (2019)</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/replaced-gpg-key-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-18T05:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-11-18T05:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2019-11-18:/blog/replaced-gpg-key-2019.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently got another yubikey and due to poor handling of the old key (can't load it onto the new card) I've generated a new key.

&lt;p&gt;With my move to PythonAnywhere a few weeks back, I got my Flask-based applications up and running quite easily (I have two, this blog and another application).  Then I had a bit of a heart attack on Friday realizing that Python 2 will be EOL at the end of the year.  I guess I've been hiding under a rock and far too busy with my other work -- I've not done much coding in a few years now.  At any rate, this caused a bit of a late-night panic for me so I spent Saturday thinking I would start converting both applications to Python 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I completed both on Saturday as well.  I was expecting to have to refactor and potentially rewrite more than I did, so come Saturday night I was more than pleased to realize that both were done and working as expected.  There weren't even a lot of things that needed to be changed so if I'm being honest, more time was spent refactoring code to silence pylint warnings than actually getting things to work with Python 3.7.  There were obvious things like using &lt;code&gt;print('foo')&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;print 'foo'&lt;/code&gt; and I found the &lt;a href="http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#compatible-idioms"&gt;Cheat Sheet: Writing Python 2-3 compatible code&lt;/a&gt; to be exceptionally helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a list of all I really needed to change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;print 'foo'&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;print('foo')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;urllib.urlencode()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;urllib.parse.urlencode()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;needing to UTF-8 encode a string before using hashlib on it, so:&lt;code&gt;'hashlib.md5(self.email.lower()).hexdigest()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;hashlib.md5(self.email.lower().encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ConfigParser became configparser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sgmllib is gone, so someone helpfully made sgmllib3k which will work for now but likely I'll need to find a solution for the future since it won't be maintained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;unicode()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and using BeautifulSoup4 rather than BeautifulSoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was relatively painless and there wasn't a lot that needed to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably a ton of little scripts that need to be updated, especially for the print changes, but this gives me some peace knowing it's not going to be that difficult to change existing Python 2 scripts to Python 3.  For some reason I figured this would be a terrible thing to have to do (like the stories I've heard about Perl 5 to 6).  Turns out it was not bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking at doing things like &lt;code&gt;'Some {} to print'.format(thing)&lt;/code&gt; vs using &lt;code&gt;'Some %s to print' % thing&lt;/code&gt; but after some poking around and looking in particular at &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5082452/string-formatting-vs-format"&gt;this StackOverflow question&lt;/a&gt; I figured that some things still work and are better left alone.  I'm sure there are a ton of optimizations and things I can do to make my code better now that it's running on Python 3, but that's stuff I can do in the future be it another Saturday spent hacking on some code or over Christmas holidays.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Moved to PythonAnywhere</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/moved-to-python-anywhere.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-12T02:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-08-12T02:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2019-08-12:/blog/moved-to-python-anywhere.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/logo-234x35.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note that I've moved my blog from Liquid Web (which used to be WiredTree) since I didn't really need a full blown VPS anymore.  I was looking at a number of different solutions to host this blog, given it's python-based and, after a lot of reading and reviews, I settled on PythonAnywhere and so far I'm pretty happy.  Between CloudFlare for DNS and PythonAnywhere to do the actual hosting we'll see how it goes for the next month and if all is good... well, I'll save a pile of money each month which is always a good thing.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>2018: A Retrospective - Resilience</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/2018-a-retrospective-resilience.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-28T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-12-28T12:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2018-12-28:/blog/2018-a-retrospective-resilience.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/apple-on-tree.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sit here taking my first real break of the year, suffering with fever, chills and a ridiculously stuffy nose that has lasted since before the holidays began, I turn once again to a retrospective of 2018 after reading the &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/2017-a-retrospective"&gt;one I wrote last year&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;As I sit here taking my first real break of the year, suffering with fever, chills and a ridiculously stuffy nose that has lasted since before the holidays began, I turn once again to a retrospective of 2018 after reading the &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/2017-a-retrospective"&gt;one I wrote last year&lt;/a&gt;.  Once again, life provided no shortage of "interesting things" this year and since I appear to be doing this on an annual basis (and enjoying looking back), why break with a new(ish) tradition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to define this last year with a word it would be &lt;em&gt;resilience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple other choice words for 2018.  Crazy.  Insane.  Busy.  Challenging.  Frustrating.  Stressful.  The list could go on, but I don't like any of those words because they just define the period in time.  I like &lt;em&gt;resilience&lt;/em&gt; because it defines &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.  How I handled all of those other choice words is summed up in this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was going to be a challenging year, without a doubt.  I knew that towards the end of last year when I found out I would be leading the Red Hat Product Security team, at least on an interim basis.  I started 2018 as the interim Director of the team and the only things in my favour were experience and a crap-ton of tenacity and determination.  It was not a given thing that I would remain in this role (I did not know if I wanted it, or if it wanted me).  Before taking this role I had spoken with my new manager once for about five minutes, three years prior.  He was a new unknown.  My new peers were entirely unknown.  Would I like working with them?  I have this thing about working relationships, so knowing the answer to this question was important for me.  Thankfully, they're all awesome, a really great group of people.  My new boss is fantastic and I really enjoy working for him.  But this was a great unknown for me given I had reported to my predecessor for 9 years; he was an amazing boss and it was a distinct honour to work for him.  I'd changed roles a few times in Product Security in the last few years but my manager was my single constant throughout that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I also went with some friends from our church and my family to take a 2.5 week tour of Israel, Egypt and Jordan which was awesome.  It was time off but I think I "worked" harder on that trip than I do at work (at least insofar as the walking is concerned!).  Shortly after we came back, it was to the permanency of my role within Red Hat Product Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which kicked off a whole new level of responsibility and ownership for a team that I have had the amazing privilege of working with for almost a decade.  There was a ton to learn, a whole world of "stuff" that I never had to think about before.  The weight of this responsibility settled on my shoulders and I think it actually settled pretty well.  At least it felt &lt;em&gt;comfortable&lt;/em&gt;.  Hard to describe, honestly, but I never felt overwhelmed.  Out of my depth at times, certainly.  There were days that the "imposter syndrome" felt very very real.  And this year I pushed harder, worked harder, worked longer, than I ever had before in the past.  And while there were weeks that felt really rough and were really draining, I didn't ever feel empty or drained.  I think the sheer challenge in and of itself energized me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, from a work perspective, this was a very busy, very challenging, but very &lt;em&gt;fulfilling&lt;/em&gt; year.  I found how to be resilient and adapt to the change and come out of it at the end of the year better than I went into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the personal side, things this year were also tough.  There were some really significant medical things to deal with, from a family member suffering with depression, to another with acute pancreatitis, to another with a bleed in the brain, and finally to my own wife who by the doctors accounts really shouldn't be celebrating Christmas with us this year (but who, by the grace of God, is!).  Thankfully all of these are either resolved or looking so much better, but this was a real personal strain on me this year, while at the same time trying to lead my amazing team and grow into the role I thought I would have had a lot more time to prepare for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either one of these personal or professional scenarios on its own is pretty tough.  When you throw both of them together, it's been one heck of a year.  But here I sit, writing this at the end of the year, looking back on all of these challenges and feeling no worse for it.  (I do actually feel worse right now having gotten my daughter's cold.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having a conversation with some other leaders in Red Hat earlier this month as part of the ALDP (Advanced Leadership Development Program) that I am in, and we were talking about resiliency.  Resilience was defined as: &lt;em&gt;how quickly and effectively you are able to take steps that are positive and moving forward in the face of adversity or challenges&lt;/em&gt;.  Without that conversation and that definition, I probably wouldn't have defined 2018 by &lt;em&gt;resilience&lt;/em&gt;.  However when I look back over the last year, it simply must be defined that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the purpose behind sharing this?  Well, I've learned that resilience isn't necessarily something that you're born with and it can certainly be learned.  Like a muscle exercised over time you can grow your resilience.  I look at 2018 as setting me up to handle the challenges I'm sure to be facing ahead (without pointing to the big... ummm... "purple elephant" in the room).  This muscle has been exercised a lot this year.  With the perspective of time and distance, I can honestly say that it is stronger now (and was probably stronger than I thought to begin with).  I imagine this is true for most of those reading this if you're honest with yourself.  None of us thinks we can do it until we're put into a position where we have no choice &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; to do it.  The amazing adaptability of humans will never cease to amaze me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I've realized is that the world is much more volatile and the pace of change is increasing.  We all &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be more resilient in this volatile, uncertain and ever-changing environment.  Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher, once said, "Change is the only constant."  How true this is.  Jesus, in Matt 6:34 said, "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."  This too is absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can paralyze ourselves with what-ifs.  All we can really do is take care of today and prepare for tomorrow.  Worrying and stressing about it, or what it might bring, does us no good.  Doing the best that you can &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; is all anyone can ever ask and honestly it's all you can deliver.  You can't deliver tomorrow today, so why worry about it?  Show up at your best today and worry about tomorrow, well, tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I think a lot of what kept me going through everything this year boils down to a number of factors.  First and foremost is my relationship with Jesus.  I am simply no good without Him.  Secondly, the faith and support of my amazing wife who put up with a 390% increase in travel this year compared to last year, not to mention a 50% increase in time spent working.  I am simply no good without her.  And finally to my amazing team, who put up with me for more hours a week than they probably should have had to and who do such a stellar job and, for the most part, make my job pretty straightforward.  I could not do what I do without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said last year that I would blog more.  That didn't happen, unfortunately.  I make no promises for next year... we'll see what happens.  I hope everyone had an amazing Christmas with friends and family, as well as a safe and prosperous New Year!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>Using LetsEncrypt with Plex</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/using-letsencrypt-with-plex.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-24T10:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-12-24T10:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2018-12-24:/blog/using-letsencrypt-with-plex.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/plex-plex.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I blogged about using LetsEncrypt with FreeNAS.

&lt;p&gt;The other day I blogged about using LetsEncrypt with FreeNAS.  There were another two things around the house that I wanted to have proper SSL certificates on: my Plex server and the Unifi Controller.  The latter looks like far too much effort to go through, but I did get it up and running for Plex pretty quickly this morning.  Since I also used the same CloudFlare-based API updates for DNS, this one goes through a bit more detail than the previous post simply because I had to go through it again and could capture the steps along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that my Plex server runs in an iocage jail on FreeNAS so if you're running Plex on Linux it will look a bit different since this is FreeBSD-based.  One notable thing is that md5sum, which I needed to use, is apparently not something that FreeBSD provides by default (who knew?) so you'll need to &lt;code&gt;pkg install coreutils&lt;/code&gt; and use gmd5sum if you happen to be using FreeBSD (on most Linux distros you simply get md5sum as part of the base install).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step is to install the acme.sh client that will obtain the LetsEncrypt certificates.  We'll checkout from git since I prefer to see shellscripts before I run them, particularly when doing so as root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# cd /root
# git clone https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh.git
# cd acme.sh
# ./acme.sh --install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now want to exit the shell or reload the environment to get the new environment that the installer setup.  At this point you'll also want to get your CloudFlare API key.  Below we'll assume the hostname for the Plex server is "plex.hostname.com".  Once you've reloaded your environment (logout then login works):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# export CF_KEY=&amp;quot;[API key from CloudFlare]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# export CF_Email=&amp;quot;[CloudFlare login email address]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# cd /root/.acme.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ./acme.sh --issue --dns dns_cf -d plex.hostname.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will take a little over two minutes to run.  Once it has completed, if it is successful, your certificates will be in &lt;code&gt;/root/.acme.sh/plex.hostname.com/&lt;/code&gt;.  Also note that these commands are not run in the git repo we checked out; you can remove that repo if you want to, you won't use it again unless you want to keep the acme.sh script up to date.  The directory to run the script is &lt;code&gt;/root/.acme.sh&lt;/code&gt; (note the initial dot in the  directory name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to create a PKCS #12 certificate file, which is an archive file format used to store the server certificate, private key, and any intermediate certificates in a single encrypted binary file.  These files often have a p12 or or pfx extension, however  Plex seems to like pkfx for the extension.  We will need to use openssl to combine the files that acme.sh provided for us into one for Plex to use.  Since it is encrypted, we need to provide it with a passphrase, which we will tell Plex about later.  In this example, the passphrase is "foo".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# openssl pkcs12 -export -out plex-certificate.pkfx \&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;inkey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hostname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;\&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hostname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;\&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;certfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fullchain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;\&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;passout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create a &lt;code&gt;plex-certificate.pkfx&lt;/code&gt; file in the current directory.  I moved this file to &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/&lt;/code&gt; although you can put it anywhere that the Plex server will be able to get at.  Next, go to the Plex web UI and navigate to &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Server&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Network&lt;/em&gt; and then click &lt;em&gt;Show Advanced&lt;/em&gt;.  You will be able to enter the following values as per our example above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom certificate location: &lt;strong&gt;/usr/local/etc/plex-certificate.pkfx&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom certificate encryption key: &lt;strong&gt;foo&lt;/strong&gt; (the password)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom certificate domain: &lt;strong&gt;https://plex.hostname.com:32400&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also suggest keeping &lt;em&gt;Secure connections&lt;/em&gt; to Preferred, at least for now, to ensure you don't get locked out if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should be able to navigate to your Plex web UI using HTTPS rather than HTTP.  You shouldn't have to restart the Plex server.  If all works well and you get no errors or insecure warnings in your web browser, we can then turn to automating certificate renewals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acme.sh install put an entry into cron which runs daily:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;/root/.acme.sh&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;acme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;/root/.acme.sh&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to change this because we have to create the PKCS #12 file out of the acme.sh output.  We'll create a wrapper that will run the above command and if we find any changes, will create the needed certificate file, put it in place, and restart the Plex server.  Because we're using CloudFlare and doing updates via the API key (which acme.sh dutifully stored for us as part of the configuration information for this host), this will be a very simple script to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can call the script whatever you like and put it wherever you like, I created &lt;code&gt;/root/update-plex-cert.sh&lt;/code&gt; with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;plex.hostname.com&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ACMEHOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/root/.acme.sh
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CERTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ACMEHOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CERTPASS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DESTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/usr/local/etc/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PKFXFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;plex-certificate.pkfx&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;TMPFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;mktemp&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
gmd5sum &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CERTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;.cer &amp;gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;TMPFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ACMEHOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/acme.sh --cron --home &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ACMEHOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
gmd5sum -c &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;TMPFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# nothing has changed&lt;/span&gt;
  rm -f &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;TMPFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
openssl pkcs12 -export -out &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DESTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PKFXFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -inkey &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CERTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;.key &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -in &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CERTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;.cer &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -certfile &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CERTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/fullchain.cer &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -passout pass:&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CERTPASS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
chmod &lt;span class="m"&gt;644&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DESTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PKFXFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
rm -f &lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;TMPFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

service plexmediaserver_plexpass restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the script is saved, make it executable and then edit the crontab entry to point to the new script.  You may need to tweak a few things based on your operating system (using FreeBSD it uses &lt;code&gt;gmd5sum&lt;/code&gt; but on Linux you'd use &lt;code&gt;md5sum&lt;/code&gt;; also the service likely needs to be changed depending on the Plex media server's service name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# chmod 700 /root/update-plex-cert.sh
# crontab -e
# crontab -l
16 0 * * * /root/update-plex-cert.sh &amp;gt; /dev/null
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it!  You can give it a try to see how it would work by modifying the script to force the update by using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ACMEHOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/acme.sh --cron --force --home &lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ACMEHOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and running the script (using &lt;code&gt;sh -x /root/update-plex-cert.sh&lt;/code&gt; is a great way to see what it is doing).  You should see it obtain a new certificate and everything that follows.  Re-start your browser and connect to the Plex web UI, examine the certificate details and you should see a later date than the first time you did it.  If that works, be sure to remove &lt;code&gt;--force&lt;/code&gt; or you'll be updating the certificate every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, this is pretty straightforward and hopefully helpful to someone out there (including future-me).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Bsd"></category><category term="plex"></category><category term="ssl"></category></entry><entry><title>Using LetsEncrypt on FreeNAS</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/using-letsencrypt-on-freenas.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-22T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-12-22T11:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2018-12-22:/blog/using-letsencrypt-on-freenas.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/freenas.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week my LetsEncrypt certificate expired on FreeNAS which effectively locked me out of my FreeNAS UI when using Chrome (my default browser).  Thinking perhaps that I had forgotten something during my upgrade to FreeNAS 11.2 I set out to figure out what the problem was, only to realize two things: one, I hadn't setup a cronjob to renew and two, I didn't blog about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually I write blogs primarily for my benefit on these things so that I can go back and look at some of the things I've done.  So this is an attempt to repair that and record information for future-me, although perhaps it will be helpful for some of you as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, I use CloudFlare for DNS for the domain I use for home.  For the moment lets assume I use &lt;code&gt;annvix.com&lt;/code&gt; for home and we'll also assume that the hostname for my FreeNAS server is &lt;code&gt;freenas.annvix.com&lt;/code&gt; (neither are obviously true).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to install the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh"&gt;acme.sh&lt;/a&gt; client on the FreeNAS server.  You could go through a bunch of hoops by installing it in a dedicated jail, etc. but I opted not to.  Instead I have it installed as the root user on my FreeNAS server and it ends up in &lt;code&gt;/root/.acme.sh/&lt;/code&gt;.  Second, install the &lt;a href="https://github.com/danb35/deploy-freenas"&gt;deploy-freenas&lt;/a&gt; python script; it ends up as &lt;code&gt;/root/deploy_freenas.py&lt;/code&gt;.  Create the config file as described, mine lives in &lt;code&gt;/root/.deploy_config&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/tree/master/dnsapi"&gt;instructions for using acme.sh with CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; are pretty simple; I'm not going to repeat them here.  I chose to use CloudFlare because it's free and has an API which makes this all very simple and very transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is you should have a config file in &lt;code&gt;/root/.acme.sh/freenas.annvix.com/freenas.annvix.com.conf&lt;/code&gt; and the only thing really to point out is that you want it to contain this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Le_ReloadCmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/root/deploy_freenas.py --config /root/.deploy_config&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That reload command will automatically update the FreeNAS web UI with the new certificate.  Note that it doesn't remove certificates, so you might want to manually prune them every once in a while in the FreeNAS web UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and the big part that I missed, is you want to enable a cronjob to run this every day.  This should be done via the web UI.  In the web UI navigate to &lt;em&gt;Tasks&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;Cron Jobs&lt;/em&gt;.  Add a new daily task that runs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;/root/.acme.sh/acme.sh --cron --home /root/.acme.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll know in March whether or not it works, but I'm pretty sure it will.  You should be able to see the certificate listed in the web UI in &lt;em&gt;System&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;Certificates&lt;/em&gt;.  This is also where you'll want to prune any old certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I'm going to look at how to use LetsEncrypt with Plex since I hate seeing the "Not Secure" label whenever I go to the Plex UI.  This time I'll be sure to blog about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Bsd"></category><category term="freenas"></category><category term="ssl"></category></entry><entry><title>Migrate plex from a warden jail to an iocage jail</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/migrate-plex-from-a-warden-jail-to-an-iocage-jail.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-04T16:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-11-04T16:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2018-11-04:/blog/migrate-plex-from-a-warden-jail-to-an-iocage-jail.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/plex.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running FreeNAS 11.2 beta for a while (currently on 11.2-RC1).  I've got a bunch of media on it from when I started running FreeNAS 9 (home videos, music, etc.) and I've not taken the step to migrate the old warden-based jails to the newer iocage jails …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/plex.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running FreeNAS 11.2 beta for a while (currently on 11.2-RC1).  I've got a bunch of media on it from when I started running FreeNAS 9 (home videos, music, etc.) and I've not taken the step to migrate the old warden-based jails to the newer iocage jails.  This meant that my Plex jail was not listed in the web UI.  I could get into the jail using &lt;code&gt;jexec&lt;/code&gt; but couldn't really configure it or use the web UI to control it.  This was sufficient to apply Plex upgrades and other things that I needed to do, from within the jail, which was all CLI-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst other fiddling today, I decided to create a new jail in the FreeNAS web UI and try to migrate the old jail to a new one.  It had to take 10 minutes or less or I wasn't interested (I didn't want to fight with it on a Sunday!).  I was pleasantly surprised.. it took maybe 15 minutes including testing.  But I had prepared the old jail a long time ago in that I had all of the media and data files in storage volumes outside of the jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one pool named "storage" and within this pool I have two datasets: "plex" and "plex_media".  The first contains all the media files for Plex, the second has all the data files (basically &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/plexdata&lt;/code&gt;).  This meant that all configuration data for Plex existed outside of the jail.  If you have these local to the jail, you'll want to create a dataset, stop the Plex server, mount the dataset in the jail, and copy the data files over.  Plex respects symlinks so it works out pretty good (you'll see what I mean in a moment).  I had &lt;code&gt;plex&lt;/code&gt; mounted in the jail at &lt;code&gt;/media&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;plex_media&lt;/code&gt; mounted in the jail at &lt;code&gt;/plex_media&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating the new jail involved very little "special sauce".  When I created the jail, I added similar mount points as those described above to the jail.  I also made sure before I started the new jail to stop the Plex server running in the old jail since having two Plex servers accessing the same metadata at the same time would probably cause issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this using (in the old jail):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# service plexmediaserver stop
# sysrc plexmediaserver_enable=NO
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, you can see where those datasets are mounted in the jail using &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; on the FreeNAS host:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;/mnt/storage/plex on /mnt/iocage/jails/plex/root/media (nullfs, local)
/mnt/storage/plex_media on /mnt/iocage/jails/plex/root/plex_media (nullfs, local)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new jail, which was pristine, I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pkg upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;tool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;yet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;installed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;want&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ln -s /plex_media plexdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# service plexmediaserver start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept the old &lt;code&gt;plexdata&lt;/code&gt; directory just as a precaution; you could easily delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this I grabbed the MAC address of the jail so that I could update my static DHCP mapping to give it the IP address of the old jail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@plex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ifconfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ether&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ether&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;fa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After updating the DHCP server and flushing the ARP cache, I restarted the jail using the web UI.  After that, Plex was running properly with all of the old media, at the old web address, available to Google Chromecast and my mobile devices, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you can run Plex as a plugin but I like running it in a jail as you get a bit more control over it and don't typically have to wait too long for Plex server upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is to remove the old warden jail.  I'll likely wait a few days before I do that to ensure the new jail is working properly.  In the meantime, with the new DHCP map and the Plex server disabled in the old jail, it shouldn't be running and interfering with anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was actually a lot easier than I had expected!  This is the second migration of Plex I've done and the first was so painful I didn't want to try again, but this one was really easy (granted the first was from a macOS server to FreeNAS so there was a bit more effort, but it completely hosed all of my metadata so it was like starting from scratch).  At any rate, I know a lot of people in the FreeNAS community that use Plex were having difficulty with migrating jails so I thought I would quickly write this up for anyone who might still need it (keeping in mind that 11.2 is still technically a beta product although it's worked pretty well for me thus far, your mileage may vary).  For the record, it took me longer to write this than to do the actual upgrade!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step is to setup another jail to play with OpenProject and possibly move my GitHub setup from a separate machine here at home onto the FreeNAS server (those are likely Christmas shutdown projects though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the parable of the stonecutters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favourite parables/stories because it speaks of purpose and passion in a very simple to understand way.  If you’ve not heard the parable before, let me relay it briefly.

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the parable of the stonecutters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favourite parables/stories because it speaks of purpose and passion in a very simple to understand way.  If you’ve not heard the parable before, let me relay it briefly.  There are three stonecutters doing the same, back breaking, tedious, difficult work of cutting stone.  This is not an easy job.  There’s no air conditioning.  There’s no power tools.  There is simply you, a chisel, and stone.  Imagine the effort, the heat… the day after day effort of doing the same thing, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day a traveler comes down the road and sees these three men, working away cutting stone.  He asks the first man what it is that he is doing and the man replies that he is cutting stone.  The traveler moves on to the second man and asks the same question and the man replies that he is building a wall.  Finally, he moves on to the third man and asks him the same question to which the third man replies, “I’m building a cathedral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each man is doing the same work, putting in the same effort.  The first man is clearly there for the sake of the job -- he does what he needs to do to collect the money he is going to be paid.  This man had a &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second man sees a little further than the work itself.  While he’s not laying the stone in the wall, he knows the purpose for which he works.  He knows what his work contributes to.  This man had a &lt;em&gt;career&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third man, however, saw beyond the work of his hands and even where the stone he was cutting would be laid.  He saw the big picture, he saw the end result.  This man, although he was doing the same work as the others, had been inspired with a vision.  This man had a &lt;em&gt;calling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine each man also had a different response to the work.  When all you see is the stone, with no idea of its place, perhaps the finished product doesn’t matter so much.  After all, you’re given the dimensions, you know how big to make the pieces, but what happens after that doesn’t really matter.  I expect this man wasn’t so precise in the work he was doing.  Maybe he took shortcuts just to get the job done quicker.  Maybe it didn’t matter to him if a cut wasn’t perfect or the size was slightly off.  After all, what difference did it make?  He was simply there to do a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second probably took a little more pride in his work.  After all, he knew someone else after him would take the stone he cut and would fit it into the wall.  Maybe his measurements were more precise, the cuts smoother to ensure the pieces fit together.  He knew what the stone was for and he knew they would have to fit well together.  Perhaps he took a bit more care to roughen the edges of the stone so the grout would hold the pieces together better.  At any rate, he knew the project, the work, was bigger than just the stone he was cutting in the moment and I imagine his effort rose with that belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third man, however, looked at his work in an entirely different light.  This man knew he was doing more than just cutting stone, knew he was contributing to something grander than just a wall.  This man I imagine putting in the time and effort to make sure the stone was cut to perfection… every piece just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;.  Whether this stone he was cutting would be used for a wall or a buttress or the floor, it didn’t matter.  He cut it to exact dimensions, he ensured each piece was beautiful.  He wasn’t building a simple building or a road, he was building something grand and majestic and he put in the time, patience, effort, and all of his skill because he knew he was contributing to something great, something that would survive him, something that would benefit many people and be admired by them.  I imagine this man put his heart and soul into it and would accept nothing less than precision because what he was helping make would be incredible -- beyond what one man could make himself.  He was a part of it, he contributed to it, his pieces helped make this cathedral a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story came to my mind as I was watching my garage get constructed this week.  The first crew that came in to pour the cement were an interesting bunch.  They showed up to do the work, usually late.  They came and dug out where the concrete pad would sit one day.  Two days later they framed it.  The next day they poured the concrete.  A week and a half later they came and dug out the sidewalk in the backyard, which was meant to be 3’ across yet they used a 6’ skid steer to dig out the path.  And tore the lawn to pieces while they did it.  Then tore up the driveway so badly that they needed to replace the gravel.  And left a pile of dirt that still needs to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They framed up the sidewalk and apron to the garage four days ago.  They were meant to have the concrete done before the garage was framed.  They guaranteed they would be here yesterday, the day the framing was to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could arguably say they were doing the job they were paid to do.  But they were careless.  They didn’t respect the property they were on.  They left nails in the alley, empty water bottles and orange peels on my deck, nails in the yard.  This crew was the first man.  They did their job, technically (I do, after all, have concrete in place).  Because they chose an expedient way to do the work, they ended up having to replace the gravel on a perfectly good driveway; I imagine that ate into their profits due to the cost of the gravel and the time to lay it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framing crew, however, are a different class.  They were here this morning before I was even awake and had the side walls framed by the time I realized they were here.  They worked fast, but with precision.  They knew what needed to be done and in what order, and they did it well.  When I knew the framing was going to happen yesterday, I expected the frame alone to be done.  Yet the walls, trusses, and roof are complete.  Obviously there is siding, drywall, insulation, electrical, and much more that needs to be done but these four fellows measured twice and cut once, worked together to get this raised, and at the end of the day I was very much impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I should also mention that they did it in 35C weather and in poor air quality conditions due to wildfires a province over (you can taste the smoke on the air and feel the irritants on your eyes).  And after a long day in these conditions?  Before they even drank any of the ice water I brought out for them as they were packing up, they cleaned the workplace so it was spotless.  Picked up the garbage, moved discarded pieces out of the way.  The left the site cleaner than they found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way these two crews approached their work were vastly different.  They both had jobs to do and arguably they both did it.  One at additional cost (someone’s going to pay for the lawn they tore up!) and one being methodical, precise, and diligent.  The first crew did their job.  The second crew, perhaps they recognized this as their career and were willing to do the exceptional work.  I don’t know for certain if they think building homes or garages is their calling, but their approach to the work stands in stark contrast to the first crew.  To one I’m &lt;em&gt;grateful&lt;/em&gt; they did their job, although I certainly would have liked it to be better, but to the second I’m &lt;em&gt;pleased&lt;/em&gt; with their work.  Would I recommend the first crew?  Probably not.  The second?  Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it this far you’re probably wondering what the point is.  Maybe you see it already, maybe not.  It does make me wonder if we simply show up to do the job, one &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, at a time.  Or are we taking this work and using it to hone our craft, to become increasingly &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; so that we can see the vision, the cathedral, built through our efforts and labour?  Do we see the &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; to our work, the change to the world we strive to make?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting purpose to the work is important.  Purpose is what allows you to see the big picture, the vision for the work being done, no matter what role you play in the process.  Without that purpose, without that vision, you never see beyond the task at hand which means missing the grandeur of what is being built.  In fact it robs you of that connection to the bigger picture -- it robs you of inspiration, it robs you of ownership, it robs you of feeling that you are a part of something bigger than you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all a part of something bigger than we are.  The whole is always greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="leadership"></category></entry><entry><title>Pictures of Israel</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/pictures-of-israel.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-01T22:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-06-01T22:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2018-06-01:/blog/pictures-of-israel.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/41784128904_e496ddb419_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favourite places in Israel were the Garden of Gethsemane, Madasa, Shiloh (who wouldn't want to stand basically where the Ark of the Covenant rested?!? plus the budding almond trees were beautiful) and Tel Dan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for this taking so long... I know there are quite a few people who have been after me to post the pictures.  Unfortunately due to time constraints I have skipped to the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of the trip to post pictures from Jordan (since there are less than those of Israel).  One of my favourite places on the trip was Petra, so the bulk of the pictures are from there.  This is, of course, just a small sampling of the better pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and I hope to not take as long to get the pictures of Israel up (apologies again to those who really want to see those pics, you'll have to wait a wee bit longer..)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are far too many pictures taken of my recent trip, but since I'm being (graciously!) hounded by friends I figured I'd note when some of them were available so I've gotten the first few up, just of the Egypt part.

&lt;p&gt;There are far too many pictures taken of my recent trip, but since I'm being (graciously!) hounded by friends I figured I'd note when some of them were available so I've gotten the first few up, just of the Egypt part.  The Israel part will take longer though as that is where the bulk of the trip was.   I think these ones are a good sampling of the many pictures I took.  I hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, standing on the pyramids was pretty darn amazing, something I had never expected to do in my life.  And the pictures of the cave church really don't do justice to how amazing it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One downside of the trip is that I forgot the battery charger for my Nikon so took more pictures on my iPhone than I would have if I knew I could charge the battery for the Nikon.  Miraculously, the battery did not die and made it to the end of the trip although that was because I was pretty disciplined with saving it for the scenic pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past last half of February I took a trip with my family and members of our church on a tour of the "land of the Bible" (Egypt, Israel, and Jordan).

&lt;p&gt;This past last half of February I took a trip with my family and members of our church on a tour of the "land of the Bible" (Egypt, Israel, and Jordan).  This was a 15 day trip that took us to and through five countries in four continents.  It was a whirlwind trip... super busy, amazing in a lot of ways, and offered a lot of opportunities for quiet reflection.  This post is the first of two, I think.. there simply isn't space to record both the places we went and the thoughts I had about them, so this one will focus on the trip itself and all the places we went.  The next post, hopefully in the next week or two, will share some of those thoughts and reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left Edmonton on February 14 heading to Toronto, then Munich, then to Cairo.  We landed in Cairo on Feb 15 and went straight from the airport to the Nile river where we boarded a boat to have dinner on the Nile itself.  Given it was pretty late by the time we got on there, we didn't see much of Cairo other than that the Nile is a hopping place at night... plenty of river boats with food and music.  Sadly I did not see any crocodiles, just some stray cats and dogs along the shore.  And a donkey.  After our trip along the river for an hour or so, we got back on the bus and headed to our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, my eye must be very tuned to Shadowman.  I saw him briefly on a building while in the bus... what are the odds of seeing him in Cairo?  It must have been a partner company as he was alongside a Dell and HP logo if I remember correctly.  Anyways, it went by too fast to snap a pic, but it was neat to see nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we woke up to a view of the pyramids from the hotel room which was pretty amazing.  We then went to the pyramids and the sphinx.  At first it was pretty hard to see.. the pollution in Cairo is insane.  It is apparently &lt;a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/user-resources/sensing-our-planet/a-black-cloud-over-cairo"&gt;one of the most polluted cities on the planet&lt;/a&gt;.  My wife even developed what we called the "cairo cough".. it lingered until a day or two after we left.  Anyways, the pyramid was amazing.  To think that people, thousands of years ago, built these magnificent things makes me think again of the power of unity -- people banded together, with one vision, can accomplish fantastic things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then made our way to the Cairo Museum which was neat (lots of artifacts, mummies, old things).  Honestly if not for the pictures I wouldn't remember much... the fatigue hit &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; while there and it was hard just to remain vertical.  After the museum, we drove up to the &lt;a href="http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/09/the-cave-church-of-zabbaleen-in-cairo.html"&gt;cave church of the Zabbaleen&lt;/a&gt; which is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been.  The trip getting to and from the church, conversely, is one of the most depressing things I've ever seen.  You need to drive through an area inhabited largely by Coptic Christians who collect garbage.  Given Egypt is a Muslim-majority country, these Coptic Christians have a hard go of it to begin with, but the living conditions (to this Canadian) are somewhat horrific.  Yet, for all that, finding a happier group of people might be a challenge!  The people were friendly, happy, and very interested in this group of 18 Canadians who travelled up to their church.  The church itself, carved out of the rock, was amazing.  The stone carvings in and around the church were beautiful.  The pyramids were cool, don't get me wrong, but this church was breath-taking.  In our short time in Egypt, this was my highlight.  The trip up and down to this beautiful place was challenging and offered the sort of perspective that I think a lot of people in North America, at least, could benefit from.  It was a sobering ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, we headed to the airport again to fly up to Sharm El Sheikh where we spent the night at a resort hotel and the morning along the Red Sea enjoying the beach and nice weather.  In the afternoon we got on the bus and drove to Nuweiba where we spent the night and planned to climb what they believe was Mount Sinai (up to Saint Catherine's Monastery).  The intent was to go at 3am to watch the sunrise at the top of the mountain but due to poor weather, most of us opted out since it would make the climb challenging.  And given the smell of camel I experienced at the pyramids I was unwilling to deal with a camel ride up the mountain.  A few of the group did, though, and they said it was amazing.  The rest of us caught up on sleep and enjoyed a morning on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mountain climbers got back (and showered!) from Mount Sinai, we drove to the Egypt/Israel border, crossed, and headed to Eilat where we went to &lt;a href="https://www.coralworld.co.il/en/"&gt;Coral World&lt;/a&gt; and the Underwater Observatory.  This was a pretty cool place seeing a bunch of fish and other marine critters.    It was also the first place in Israel that we were, and I can tell you that the contrast between Egypt and Israel is dramatic.  Where Egypt, for the most part (especially Cairo) was dirty, full of garbage, chaotic, and horribly smelly, Eilat was clean, smelled great, and people actually paid attention to traffic laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the night in Eilat then drove to &lt;a href="http://www.parktimna.co.il/en/"&gt;Timna Park&lt;/a&gt; where we got to see a life-size replica of the Tabernacle of Moses.  This was really neat because standing in something that was built to the specifications noted in the Bible was quite different than seeing a picture or model.  We also went to Solomon's Pillars here, which were amazing.  I'll update this article in the next week or so with a link to pictures so you can see them.  After this we drove through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhtesh_Ramon"&gt;Makhtesh Ramon&lt;/a&gt; where a meteor caused a great crater in the Negev.  I thought it would be more exciting, but it just looked like the rest of the desert other than we had to drive up, then down, through it, then up again.  Taking some pics from the observation point was pretty neat.  I spotted no Kryptonians.  We then continued driving up to Tel-Aviv where we spent the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we picked up the last 8 people who were just joining us for the Israel/Jordan part of the trip (the Egypt part was an optional extension to the tour).  Now we were 22 people and we drove up to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarea_Maritima"&gt;Caesarea Maritima&lt;/a&gt; where we saw ruins of the ancient city, the theatre, the hippodrome and the aqueduct.  Then we drove up to Mount Carmel which was exciting to me as I love the story of Elijah and the priests of Baal (1 Kings 18).  We headed back to Tel-Aviv for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday (Feb 21) we headed out to Shiloh, where the Tabernacle of Moses had been.  This was a really neat moment and place because as I was standing there I realized I was in the very place where the Ark of the Covenant actually resided... literally on the spot where it sat on the ground.  This was not something I would have ever thought I would be able to do in my lifetime, so it was quite profound for me.  But that was just the beginning of profound moments for me that day.. this was probably the most personally reflective days of the trip because after this we headed into Jerusalem where we went to the Mount of Olives, the Garden of Gethsemane, Golgotha (Skull Hill), and to the Garden Tomb.  Each of these locations were quite solemn for us as this is where Jesus spent that last night before heading to the Cross, dying, being buried in the tomb, and then rising from the grave.  The opportunity to take communion at the Garden Tomb was an experience I can't even describe.  Suffice it to say, this was probably the most memorable part of the trip for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this we went to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zedekiah%27s_Cave"&gt;Zedekiah's Cave&lt;/a&gt; which was pretty cool, and the Pool of Bethesda which was neat because it proved to be real when many had thought it wasn't (because they hadn't excavated it yet).  It also had a cool church with amazing acoustics; one of the young ladies in the group can really sing and in this church it sounded &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;.  This would be a great place for some good Gregorian Chants!   Then from there we went into the old city bazaar where we could do some shopping.  Honestly, we were in for a few minutes and I wanted out... it was crazy, busy, congested, and hard to breathe.  I could live my life without going into a bazaar like that again!  I'll take the open-air kind or the farmer's markets we have at home.  We then went to the Tower of David for a neat &lt;a href="https://www.tod.org.il/en/"&gt;sound and light show&lt;/a&gt;.  After this, back to the hotel in Tel-Aviv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, we went to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_David"&gt;City of David&lt;/a&gt; which is the entrance to Hezekiah's Tunnel (or the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siloam_tunnel"&gt;Siloam Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;).  This tunnel has you going through water, but there's a shorter (and drier) side tunnel you can take which some of us who didn't feel like getting hip-deep in the water opted to take.  We then took a shuttle to the Dung Gate so we didn't have to walk so far (I will have you know that each day we walked on average 10km!) and while we waited for our bus we watched a bunch of Bar Mitzvahs that were heading to the Western Wall.  These were really fun to watch!  (These guys know how to have a good time!).  We then went to the &lt;a href="http://allaboutjerusalem.com/attraction/jerusalem-archaeological-park-davidson-center"&gt;Davidson Archeological Centre&lt;/a&gt;, spotted the fake Tomb of David (great for tourists I guess?), and then visited the Upper Room where Jesus and the disciples had the Last Supper.  We then visited the Western Wall, which was an interesting up-close view of traditional Judaism, and went underneath them in the &lt;a href="https://english.thekotel.org/western_wall_sites/core_excavations/about/"&gt;Kotel Excavations&lt;/a&gt; which was really neat to see all that is below the temple mount.  When we made our way out, we saw what remains of &lt;a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Nehemiahs-wall-uncovered"&gt;Nehemiah's Wall&lt;/a&gt; which was really neat as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One note about Nehemiah's Wall... according to Nehemiah 6:15, they built the wall around Jerusalem in 52 days.  52 days!  Now it says they worked on it day and night, but you don't really grasp what those walls looked like by just reading about it.  Seeing it in person... that was an impressive feat!  Like the pyramids, it made me think about that power of vision and people united.  The things that can be accomplished by a team of people, united, working together, is amazing.  For someone who leads a team of people, this was a very reflective moment for me... what kinds of things can we, as professional teams, accomplish together if we put ourselves out of the way and collaborated to build and do important things?  Visiting the remnants of this wall really made me think about work and the upcoming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Wall we went back to the hotel in Jerusalem.  The next day, Friday, we drove out to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masada"&gt;Masada&lt;/a&gt; which was incredibly cool.  Masada is a mountain fortress built by Herod the Great and it has an amazing view and is fairly well preserved considering it's over 2000 years old.  From Masada we went to En Gedi, where David hid from king Saul who was hunting him (neat water springs) and the Qumran Caves where they found the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Then we went down to the Dead Sea itself (on the Israel side) but it was pretty much a gong-show with tourists and locals all over the place, super muddy, and just plain chaotic.  A few folks went into the Dead Sea (my daughter included) and floated, covered themselves in mud, etc.  My daughter says this was one of her most favourite parts of the trip.  After this we headed into Bethlehem to spend the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning we got up and went to the Shepherd's Fields in Bethlehem, which is where they say the angels appeared to the shepherds.  It's plausible, but I don't know if it's the exact field or not.  Doesn't really matter, it was neat to see and think about that time in history.  We then drove to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Megiddo"&gt;Megiddo&lt;/a&gt; which is on the edge of the Jezreel Valley.  The neat thing about this place is that the Jezreel Valley is also known as Armageddon, or where the end-time battle will be fought according to the book of Revelation.  There is debate as to whether it is symbolic or literal... we'll leave the theology alone but suffice it to say, it was an interesting place to be!  From there we went to the &lt;a href="http://www.land-of-the-bible.com/Gideons_Spring"&gt;Gideon Springs&lt;/a&gt; which is a really pretty place, and then to &lt;a href="http://www.nazarethvillage.com/"&gt;Nazareth Village&lt;/a&gt; which is a neat little place that recreates what things would have looked like in Nazareth 2000 years ago.  We saw an old wine press, an old olive press, some very interested-in-humans sheep, a woman who spun wool into thread and was making a blanket, an old tomb, old synagogue, etc.  It was really neat.  Nazareth does not look like that anymore!  Here in Edmonton we have a place called Fort Edmonton Park that recreates what it looked like for the settlers here.. this was the same kind of idea.  From there we went to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Precipice"&gt;Mount of the Precipice&lt;/a&gt; where Jesus announced himself as Messiah and the crowd tried to push him off the cliff.  The view from up here was stunning... you could see the countryside and the Valley of Jezreel for miles in all directions.  Got some really neat pictures up here.  No one tried to leap off, thankfully.  After this we headed to Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee where we spent the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday we got up and drove north through the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights"&gt;Golan Heights&lt;/a&gt; which was beautiful on our way to Tel Dan.  This place was amazing!  We got to see the old city gates and an old altar, and then found the place where &lt;a href="https://bible.org/seriespage/9-tel-dan-worshipping-altar-convenience"&gt;Jeroboam had built an altar to God&lt;/a&gt; and told the people that if it was too much effort to go to Jerusalem to sacrifice to God, they could do it there (a big no-no you can read about in 1 Kings 12).  We also saw a Canaanite gate that they call &lt;a href="https://www.haaretz.com/4-000-year-old-abraham-s-gate-reopened-to-public-after-painstaking-restoration-work-1.5089039"&gt;Abraham's Gate&lt;/a&gt; which they estimate is 4000 years old.  This was incredible to see!  After that we went to the Sea of Galilee and took a boat ride on it, looked at the Boat Museum where we saw the remains of an excavated fishing boat that is 2000 years old (they call it the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Galilee_Boat"&gt;Ancient Galilee Boat&lt;/a&gt; or the Jesus Boat).  After this we went to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Primacy_of_Saint_Peter"&gt;Saint Peter's Primacy&lt;/a&gt; where they figure he was when he became the first pope of the church (only Catholics think this of course).  After this we went to the ruins of Capernaum, then to the Jordan River baptism site (this place amused me because the Jordan River is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; clean, yet they sell Holy Water from the Jordan that is as crystal clear as... tap water... hmmm... perhaps Purified Water from the Jordan River?).  Finally we went back to the hotel in Tiberias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Feb 26, we travelled to the Israel/Jordan border and crossed into Jordan.  We went to the ruins of Gedara, which was one of the cities of the Decapolis.  I have fallen in love with ruins... ghost towns with so many stories to tell!  The basalt theatre ruins were really neat to see.  From there we went to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerash"&gt;Jerash&lt;/a&gt;, another of the Decapolis (Decapolis was a group of ten cities in the ancient Roman Empire) which are better preserved than Gedara and also exceptionally cool to see.  We then drove to Amman and saw the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman_Citadel"&gt;Amman Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, in the ancient home of the Ammonite people.  We spent the night in Amman (not at the Citadel).  Amman is an interesting city.. whereas the rest of Jordan that we saw was dirty with lots of garbage lying around,  Amman is a mix of "modern big city" they are keeping clean and "old city" that looks rough like other parts of Jordan.  I was surprised by how modern parts of it there where given what I had seen to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday we drove out to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt; which was one of my favourite parts of the trip.  Petra is absolutely breathtaking!  Too bad it's ruined by so many peddlers of cheap wares that get really obnoxious and in your face.  Some merchants were respectful enough, but a lot were downright rude and constantly in your face which made it hard to really enjoy it.  I think I spent more time walking in the long entry to get to and from Petra just because it was quieter and the rock formations are amazing.  After Petra we headed to the Dead Sea on the Jordan side and spent the night there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday we spent the morning at the Dead Sea which was much nicer and cleaner than on the Israel side (maybe because this hotel resort was right on the beach, and private, so they had incentive to keep it clean).  We then headed out to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Nebo"&gt;Mount Nebo&lt;/a&gt; where Moses got a look at the Promised Land before he died.  The view from up here is stunning!  After that we crossed the border back into Israel and drove through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho"&gt;Jericho&lt;/a&gt;, a city that is 11,000 years old (I was impressed with the Canaanite Gate at 4000 years!).  We saw a sycamore tree, the one they call the &lt;a href="http://shalomholytours.com/the-sycamore-tree/"&gt;Zacchaeus Tree&lt;/a&gt;.  I didn't know what this kind of tree looked like even though I've known the story of Zacchaeus since I was a little kid, so that was neat to see.  Finally we went to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_Elah"&gt;Valley of Elah&lt;/a&gt; where David fought Goliath, but it was too dark to really see much.  This was on our way back to Tel-Aviv and the hotel we would spend too few hours sleeping in since we had to get up at 03:00 in order to leave for the airport at 04:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Thursday was up at 03:00 (or 18:00 on Wednesday, Edmonton time) and from there we flew to Frankfurt, then to Toronto, then home.  By the time we walked in our home on Thursday it was 22:00, or 28 hours after we had woken up to head home.  None of us got much sleep on the flight so we were pretty bagged when we got home on March 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some final thoughts.  If you've made it this far, you no doubt are thinking that this wasn't much of a "vacation" because it was really busy most days and you'd be right!  We knew going into it that this was going to be busy... busier than work or school in terms of time (every day was, for the most part, leave the hotel at or around 8am and return at or around 7pm).  Then there was all the walking.  And hours in the bus.  When my family takes a vacation we enjoy a leisurely pace and visit a handful of places during the day and take time at each place.  But this was a once in a lifetime trip and given what we were going to see, we thought it worth it.  At our normal pace, we would have required five trips of two weeks or would have had to stay two or three months to see it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what we got to see was incredible.  This was my first time to the Middle East, even though I've been reading about what I visited almost my entire life.  It was exceptionally cool to see all the places and things, although I take the "this is the site of X" with a grain of salt.. some of it is proven historically, some of it is just based on tradition.  Either way, if we weren't at the exact place, we were near it, which was enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while it wasn't a relaxing vacation in the traditional sense, it was an awesome experience.  And it was a much-needed mental break from work and computers and security (although it wasn't all entirely avoided!).  And I've walked away with some new insights that I think will help me in the future, both on a practical and theological level.  I've got a new appreciation for the culture and country of Canada, and have a new interest in the history of Israel &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the events of the Bible as our local tour guide Angelina was great in sharing some of the more recent history of the places we were going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'd like to thank my good friend Mario who was our &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/guriontourcanada"&gt;tour guide&lt;/a&gt; (you can see some of his pictures from the trip on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/guriontour/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.  I wouldn't have wanted to go with anyone else.. he did an amazing job and I know it was stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll get some pictures up on Flickr in the next few days... there are about 1000 pictures to go through and cleanup, but I'll get a few up there soon!  I'll also write about some of the thoughts I had from a few of these places... most of this post just described the trip and not what I thought about in a lot of these places.  To be honest, I'm still reflecting and thinking about things and still putting the pieces together... so much was crammed into such a small amount of time.  Even writing this was helpful as it helped me remember some of the things we did, so while this may be interesting for some of you it's mostly to help me remember the trip!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="egypt"></category><category term="israel"></category><category term="jordan"></category></entry><entry><title>Open Source is 20; Let's Wander Down Memory Lane</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/open-source-is-20-lets-wander-down-memory-lane.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-11T00:45:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-02-11T00:45:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2018-02-11:/blog/open-source-is-20-lets-wander-down-memory-lane.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/Mandriva_family_tree_11-06.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Red Hat has a nice recap of what happened then in its &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/20th-anniversary-open-source"&gt;Celebrating the 20th anniversary of open source&lt;/a&gt; blog post; ZDNet has another great writeup entitled &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-turns-20"&gt;Open source is 20: How it changed programming and business forever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My purpose in writing about this amazing milestone is mostly to wax nostalgic.  I remember when Navigator's source code was released.  At that time I was in the collections industry bouncing around between being a collector and a sysadmin at one of the collection agencies I worked at then.  Actually, as hateful of a job as that was, I'm grateful for it because it introduced me to HP-UX, which piqued my interest in operating systems other than DOS or Windows.  In fact, it was when I was working at the first collection agency where I did sysadmin work that I picked up my first non-Microsoft operating system to play with at home (OS/2 Warp 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first foray into Linux was trying out Slackware (I don't remember which version, I just remember borrowing a bunch of floppies from a friend to try it).  I also remember trying out Yggdrasil, and I'm pretty sure that one was on CD.  Neither of them at that time (probably mid-90s) were very attractive to me.  Using an already installed and configured HP-UX system at work was one thing, installing Linux back then was not very user-friendly for someone getting into *nix for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first Linux install that really took was Red Hat Linux 5.0.  OS/2 was my day-to-day system, but Linux was interesting to me for a variety of reasons.  This was back when the term "free software" was used; "Open Source" was yet to come.  I remember it being pretty ugly compared to OS/2 and I remember fighting with it, trying to make my SCSI CD-Writer work.  I also remember my wife being annoyed that I spent so much time tinkering with garbage hardware (since I scrounged up anything I could) and fiddling with something that equally fascinated and frustrated me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a BBS enthusiast, having run a BBS from high school, originally on DOS and then under OS/2 (which was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; for running a BBS and being able to use it while others were dialled in).  I moved through a bunch of different BBS software (Maximus/2, Renegade, Telegard... I'm actually shocked I remember some of these names so many years later!) and ended up using software called BBBS.  It should be noted that during my BBS days I ran two different Fido-style networks (one for sysops and one for fantasy topics), wrote documentation for a number of different BBS-related utilities, wrote some utilities of my own, and was generally very much involved in the BBS "tools" community.  When I started using BBBS I also &lt;a href="https://www.bbbs.net/sysop.html"&gt;took over the documentation&lt;/a&gt; and ran a documentation project on my Freezer Burn web site back then (more on Freezer Burn in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, BBBS/2 under OS/2 worked great until IBM decided to muck up a few fixpacks and I had a lot of trouble with OS/2 running my BBS.  Thankfully, I had some exposure to Linux, and BBBS had their BBBS/Li version that ran on Linux.  So I had an option to get my BBS running on a different, hopefully more stable, operating system than OS/2.  The problem was I had only half-heartedly tinkered with Linux before and if I was going to do this I really needed to learn it.  At that time, Linux-Mandrake 5.3 was my operating system of choice and I dove into learning it while trying to keep my BBS running and still doing my work as a collector (I made a conscious choice to fully remove OS/2 and replace it with Linux -- no fallback and no choice but to learn by doing).  And since I needed some utilities for my board that were not provided by Linux-Mandrake, I started getting involved in the community by providing fixes, patches, documentation updates, and new RPM packages and that's where things really got weird because within months I was writing Linux-related articles for a number of web sites like Tech Republic, trying to evangelize Linux locally and through my Freezer Burn web site, started my own consulting company, and eventually was asked to work for MandrakeSoft (which I started to do in 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local evangelism didn't work out well, although I did meet some interesting like-minded people locally as a result.  The "general packager and documentation" role turned into docs and "the odd security fix" so that Chmouel (our then security packager) could focus more on kernel work.  I was assured it wouldn't take much time (which was largely true, for about a year).  And the rest, as they say, is history.  There was soon enough no more time to work on documentation &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; security, so security took precedence and I was a one-man security team for Mandriva for many years until I got a few people able to help.  Fun fact: the entire security build and release system for Mandriva ran in my basement, built and written entirely by me.  Another fun fact: the entire release system for advisories and package uploads, urpmi metadata updates, etc. was done by a series of commandline PHP scripts (I did mention earlier that I didn't write in C, right?).  Say what you want, but the original scripts that I started with were written in Perl and the PHP rewrite was about 2x as fast and much easier for me to work on (because while working for MandrakeSoft I also did a lot of web design and hosting, so I spent a lot of time working in PHP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the real kicker: Open Source allowed me to fork Mandriva, reduce it and change it into Annvix because I wanted something with a greater security focus.  It gave me the opportunity to learn and spend a significant number of years building my own community, reusing the work others had done, and giving away the changes I had made to that work -- to everyone who was interested.  I couldn't have done that with any other operating system at the time, and the learning opportunities it afforded me were invaluable.  Without Open Source, that sort of thing would not have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after 9 years at Mandriva I left to come to Red Hat and celebrated 9 years here when Open Source celebrated its 20th anniversary.  Even the shift and growth in Open Source in the last 9 years amazes me.  When I joined Red Hat, RHEL6 was in beta and the current release was RHEL 5.3.  Things that I take for granted now, like OpenStack and OpenShift, containers... these things didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look back and see that out of the 20 years of Open Source, I've spent 18 of them working directly for Open Source companies... companies that devoted all they had to benefit from and contribute to Open Source.  One didn't make it, despite being an excellent distro and having some amazing co-workers (many of whom, thankfully, are now also at Red Hat!), and one that did.  I remember the shock and pride when we were able to say we were &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/its-official-red-hat-becomes-the-first-1-billion-open-source-company-2012-3"&gt;the first $1B Open Source company&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.  Four years later in 2016 we were &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-becomes-first-2b-open-source-company/"&gt;the first $2B Open Source company&lt;/a&gt;.  While there are many companies that bet on Open Source and failed, there are many that succeeded -- but those are not the only success stories of Open Source.  The fact that companies like IBM and Microsoft embrace Open Source today is a testament to the work that the Open Source community has done in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that non-tech companies like WalMart and other retailers not only use Open Source but create it, is amazing.  The fact that home stereo systems, TVs, cell phones, and much of the technology we take for granted today would not exist without Open Source really makes me grateful that I am able to be a part of this epic journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I honestly don't know what I would be doing today if it wasn't for Open Source.  My mind can't even fathom its absence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="redhat"></category></entry><entry><title>2017: A Retrospective</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/2017-a-retrospective.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-30T15:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-12-30T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2017-12-30:/blog/2017-a-retrospective.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/2017-eyeball.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/2016-a-retrospective"&gt;I wrote a retrospective&lt;/a&gt; and was interesting to read it at the end of this year so I've decided to do it again.  What can I say about 2017?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a work perspective, this was a crazy year.  The vulnerabilities we had to deal with this year were …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/2017-eyeball.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/2016-a-retrospective"&gt;I wrote a retrospective&lt;/a&gt; and was interesting to read it at the end of this year so I've decided to do it again.  What can I say about 2017?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a work perspective, this was a crazy year.  The vulnerabilities we had to deal with this year were pretty significant, things like Blueborne and KRACKS and others that created a lot of work for the team.  To say it was a painful year would be an understatement, to be honest.  We put our &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2950971"&gt;Customer Security Awareness&lt;/a&gt; (CSAw) process to work more times than I would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, just the goings-on (that didn't affect Red Hat) were simply painful to watch.  The Equifax breach was bad.  Really, really bad.  And watching how it was handled was distressing.  Thankfully we did not have to deal with that Struts2 vulnerability.  And there were other data breaches that were bad as well -- the news that the Yahoo! breach was even worse than originally reported, Uber having paid off the miscreants that ran off with their data... there were others and if we thought 2016 was bad, I think 2017 took the cake and 2018 will be even worse.  IdentityForce has a &lt;a href="https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2017-data-breaches"&gt;list of the 2017 data breaches&lt;/a&gt; that you can read.  2018 will be interesting in that these breaches will be painful &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; expensive, thanks to the European GDPR (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt;) which I think is ultimately a good thing even though it will make life miserable for the people who need to be compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the personal side, this was another year of growth.  Personally, within the area of work, there were more responsibilities and more people to be responsible for.  It was a challenging year of new responsibilities.  Very little code was written in 2017, probably the least amount of code I've written in the last 15 years or so.  Except the last two days -- I spent the last two days taking the time to finally get this site updated; you should notice the differences.  They're subtle, but I think they give it a nice level of polish and the entire look is a little simpler.  I've not had the opportunity all year to spend this much time fiddling with code and it was nice (even if most of it was HTML, it was still fun work).  I think the days of putting my head down and losing myself for hours at a time writing python code are behind me, which makes me a little sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hats I wear is that of a District Pastor for Christcity church, which is effectively nothing more than being a shepherd (or leader) for a small flock (our church has seven districts in and around the city and my wife and I are in charge of one).  This means we're available to help those in need, pray for people, provide guidance and counsel, and just be available for people.  We visit sick people in the hospital as well, and this year we had to deal with our first death as District Pastors.  It was even harder as this wonderful woman who passed worked with us when we used to teach at the women's prison years ago.  She was an amazing woman, very gentle and quiet, and a good friend to my wife and I.  My wife used to take her to cancer treatment appointments, we'd visit with her, helped her move when her apartment got to be too much for her to handle, and so on.  It was tough to watch her go from a woman full of life and energy to a shadow of herself.  We were fortunate enough to visit her a few days before she died, although that was a difficult visit to make.  We've lost people in the past and this certainly was not our first funeral, but this was different because she was in our spiritual charge.  Barb, you will be missed.  Thank you for who you were and it was a distinct honour and privilege to be able to know you and count you as a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn't really get much time to blog this past year.  I had hoped to write more.  I also didn't have much time for podcasting either... this was a busy year.  How much time I will have for either next year is a huge unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 was a tough year, but overall it was good.  I feel like a lot of the change and challenges in 2016 prepared me for 2017, which in turn prepares me for 2018.  I think 2018 is going to be another year of growth and change.  There are a lot of professional challenges that need to be taken on and I'm glad I work with some amazing people that get to share in the work with me.  There is much yet to be done!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>Working Remotely</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/working-remotely.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-30T20:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2017-09-30T20:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2017-09-30:/blog/working-remotely.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/busy-1972122_1280.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read a few articles lately about working from home and some best practices for working remotely, and other topical guidance around the subject of working from home.  I always find these articles fascinating because I want to see if there's something I am missing or doing wrong.  Maybe there's …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/busy-1972122_1280.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read a few articles lately about working from home and some best practices for working remotely, and other topical guidance around the subject of working from home.  I always find these articles fascinating because I want to see if there's something I am missing or doing wrong.  Maybe there's a way I can boost my own productivity.  Some insight.  &lt;em&gt;Something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably I finish the article, sigh, and carry on.  The suggestions they make are sometimes silly, and sometimes they are no-brainers.  And since I've not written on this blog for a while, I figured I would write about what my day as a remote worker looks like.  It may also be useful for friends and family to realize that just because I'm home, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm available.  Sometimes I think people figure I don't work and can drop anything whenever &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; like.  (I wish!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as a preamble, I've worked from home since 2000.  It's not something I've done for a few weeks or months or even years.  I've been working from home for about 17 years now, and as a result I think I've developed an allergy to working in the office.  I find it very, very difficult to work from an office these days.  I do have to work from an office maybe once or twice a year (usually in a different country though!).  The benefits of meeting some of my coworkers and associates outweigh the temporary discomfort of putting jeans on and working in an office, so I do want to state up front that when working from an office is required, I usually don't mind... probably because it doesn't happen too often.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could sum up working from home in one word it would be &lt;strong&gt;discipline&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is absolutely the 100% most useful skill you need (and can develop) to work remotely from home.  Every time I read articles on this topic, however, they don't call it out specifically.  They give you ideas and routines to adopt, but they don't tell you that in order to adhere to these things you need to be &lt;strong&gt;disciplined&lt;/strong&gt; to be successful.  Tools and tricks are helpful, but they are easy to work around.  So from here on out, every topic has one underlying premise: you must have, or you must develop, discipline in order to be successful and performant when working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, let's go through some of the things that are usually suggested for remote workers and I'll share my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Dressed for Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these sites tell you that you need to get dressed for work, even if work is at home.  I suppose this is because we've conditioned ourselves that "dressing for success" is a requirement, but I expect it's more basic than that.  Just get out of bed!  Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work in your bed.  Beds are meant for sleeping in, and the same reasoning behind going to bed to sleep rather than play games or read or watch YouTube goes here: if you turn your bed into something other than a place to sleep, your brain won't properly shut down when you get into bed.  You're conditioning your brain to think of your bed no differently than your couch or your desk -- places where sleeping is generally a bad idea.  Well, for most people.  This doesn't seem to be the case with my wife who can watch YouTube, roll over, and be out.  This is not the case for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, having said that, here's my perspective.  I am a gloriously unapologetic pajama-wearing person.  My "pajamas", mind you, usually consist of a t-shirt and pajama pants, so I'm semi-dressed: I just don't put on jeans.  Ok, maybe this is TMI but the conventional suggestion of "dressing for work" doesn't cut it for me (and while I may mow the lawn in pajama pants, I've certainly never showed up to an office in pajama pants).  Sitting long hours behind a computer make me desire to be comfortable.  Pajama pants are &lt;em&gt;comfy&lt;/em&gt; and so I wear them.  I do get dressed when I need to go somewhere though.. the idea of being stranded on the side of the road in pajama pants is a little horrifying.  But from home, why not?  This is one of the perks from working from home.  Big thing is getting out of bed and moving to a working space.  Oh, just don't wear the pajamas you sleep in during the day, at the very least put on your "daytime" pajamas and set aside your "nighttime" pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Designated Work Space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people/articles suggest you have a designated work space.  I couldn't agree more.  If you live alone, I suppose it could be just about anywhere that isn't your bed.  If you don't, I would strongly suggest a space with a door.  A different or dedicated room devoted to all things work so that when you're in it, you know you're working (and just as importantly, others know you are working).  Maybe it's the psychological aspect of it, but being in a separate dedicated "office" (with a door) is a great way to maintain focus.  I actually don't ever close my door.  My daughter or my wife can wander in as they please.  They know that when my headset is on, chances are if they walk too far in someone will spot them via a video chat so that's enough of a deterrent.  But they know when I'm in here, I'm (usually) working.  And more importantly, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; know when I'm down here that I'm working.  It's a way to set that boundary between work and home.  Which leads to the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintain Work/Life Balance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the hardest things to do, because one of the great benefits of working from home is that you can take care of personal things while also dealing with work things.  But, without the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;discipline&lt;/em&gt; you can find yourself doing more personal things than work things and this can be an easy trap to fall into, particularly if you're new to remote work.  For me, having a set of firm understandings with myself and with those around me really helps.  So here's my list of required things for making sure that I can maintain that work/life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set a start time and stick to it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get up every morning at 6:30 and start at 8:00 on the nose.  There are odd days when I need to get up earlier, but I never get up later.  This 1.5 hours before I start working gives me a lot of time to get started and alert without starting my work day 10 minutes after I roll out of bed (been there, did that for many years).  This gives me ample opportunity to use what could have been a commute to get myself oriented for the day.  I'm not a breakfast person, so this involves some coffee, some time spent reading the Bible, some time spent in prayer, and some time spent exercising.  Skipping this routine usually means I'm not at my best.  Whatever your routine needs to be, set out enough time before you start so that your work time is highly productive time (some people go for meditation, go for a swim, play with your kids, whatever it is that gets your blood moving and your mind alert).  I don't know about you, but 10 minutes after I get out of bed I don't even register my own name so starting to work at that time, and trying to be performant, doesn't really happen and that first hour of work would be spent simply walking up and not being very effective.  Also note that I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a morning person so when I started doing this it took a huge amount of disciple and not a little internal complaining, but it has been well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of huge importance.  My family knows that my working at home isn't because we're independently wealthy and that the work done here actually pays the bills.  They also know that without the job, we don't eat, which makes it rather important.  They also know that if I can get the work done, I have more time for them in the evenings.  Making this understanding clear, they treat me, at home, as though I were in the office.  They don't sneak around like little church mice so as not to disturb me, but they know to keep their disturbances to a minimum.  I am, however, always available if they need it and no one gets barked at if they do interrupt me with good reason.  I also try (and mostly fail) to step away from the computer and get out of the office for a break every hour or so (either to grab coffee or water, etc.) and they grab me at those times if they need to.  The big point here is to make sure that those significant people in your life know that if they interrupt you when you're working you will be distracted. Those interruptions are costly, and tend to get paid for with "over time" and that simply robs everyone of quality time later.  I am not someone who wants to be thinking about work for 16 hours a day because of constant interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say it takes you, on average, about 10 minutes to get "into the zone" when you're doing creative work.  When you're in the zone and interrupted, not only does it cost you the time of the interruption (say, 5 minutes) but it also costs you another 10 minutes to get back to where you were before.  If you get two 5 minute interruptions every hour, you're only doing 30 minutes of efficient work every hour.  That is not what I would consider performant.  Forbes has an interesting article called &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2016/10/30/interruptions-at-work-are-killing-your-productivity/#45a746a01689"&gt;Interruptions At Work Are Killing Your Productivity&lt;/a&gt; that is worth a read on this topic.  Suffice it to say, if you want to feel good about (and maintain) an 8 hour workday, you want to minimize those interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time away from work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect to working at home is to make time for other activities away from work.  This is where having a separate workspace is useful, but sometimes it also means being intentional about how tethered to work you're going to be.  I used to get work email going to my phone, along with the wonderful dings to remind me that someone wanted something from me.  This doesn't help!  Now, while I can still check work mail on my phone if I want, it no longer alerts me in any way (not even visually).  I can still be reached easily enough in an emergency (a voice call, text message, etc.) but I don't let mail alert me when I'm away from my desk.  While not everyone can do this if they're on call or have certain obligations, being binged about things that I really don't need to care about at this point in time can be a real distraction in what should be downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, given you're working at home and not in an office with it's implicit social environment, you need to take time to get around people (unless you hate people, in which case ignore this advice).  I love hanging out with my family and I have plenty of home projects to do so there is no shortage of  things to do outside of work.  I'm not a big bar/club/coffee person, so am not one to go out to social environments like that.  For me, I spend quite a bit of my time at my church and with my church family and that meets my social needs and gets me hanging out with people.  I really value these times because they get me out of my work environment and keep me away from that ever-present temptation of work around the corner (which is literally the case for a remote worker).  They also keep me centred and keep me focused on the important things in life and keep my priorities in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, working remotely is a huge benefit to me, to my family, and to Red Hat as well.  I find I'm more productive since I've managed to minimize interruptions from home (still working on managing those from work, but at least you can ignore an IRC ping a little easier than someone walking into your office!).  And if I can be more productive at home in those regular working hours, it means that time spent away from work can be had without thinking about work.. if the internet isn't on fire, that is.  Remote work can be exceptionally rewarding, but for it to be effective for both you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your employer, some care has to be taken to do it well so that you can reap the benefits, and your employer can as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy reading articles about working remotely, and see the value in them given so many more people are working remotely now than when I started.  They've not really taught this old dog any new tricks, but for those new to this working from home game, or for those struggling with it, take some time to hunt them down (I won't list any, but there are a lot), read the advice and instead of overhauling everything at once, go for those incremental and impactful changes, and consistently seek to improve yourself.  Remember, it boils down to one thing: &lt;em&gt;discipline&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="remotee"></category></entry><entry><title>Red Hat Container Health Index</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/red-hat-container-health-index.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-02T14:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2017-05-02T14:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2017-05-02:/blog/red-hat-container-health-index.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/rhsummit.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of the big things that we've been working on for a while that was announced today is the Container Health Index within our &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/containers"&gt;Red Hat Container Catalog&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm not going to go into detail here as I've already done that via a blog post in the Red Hat Customer Portal entitled &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/product-security/posts/container-security-scoring"&gt;Security Scoring and Grading for Containers and Images&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also read the &lt;a href="https://investors.redhat.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2017/05-02-2017-143054640"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; for more information as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty exciting because it's great to see the realization of all this effort between a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people across a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of teams.

There's just something about goofing off with operating systems that appeals to me; this is likely what caused me to devote five years of my life to working on Annvix back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running a local &lt;a href="https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page"&gt;IPA&lt;/a&gt; install for quite a few years, but because you really need IPA to run on its own dedicated system (and given I have enough machines running in this house) I've been using KVM to handle the virtualization of an IPA server.  IPA is really cool and allowed me to discard my homegrown LDAP+Kerberos setup for something with some enterprise gusto to manage authentication, identification, and authorization policies for my home network (insert obligatory comment about overkill here).  I started using IPA on CentOS 6 and a year ago moved both guest and host to CentOS 7 which is working pretty good other than, for some odd reason, python is randomly segfaulting at times.  I don't know what the cause is, I've filed abrt reports, and it's a concern when the language that your system updater is based on decides to start crashing before installing updates or, even worse, during the installation of updates and making a mess of things (this does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make RPM happy!).  The oddest thing is that none of the other CentOS 7 systems (on bare metal) exhibit this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other problem is if my IPA server decides to tip over, I don't have a failover setup (again this being at home).  So while I was thinking about the best way to stand up another IPA server as a replicating slave to then promote it to the master and migrate away from whatever is causing all these nasty segaults, I was reminded by FreeNAS that an update was available for it, and I started thinking about jails and whether they would run Linux.  After starting down the rabbit trail, I found out about &lt;a href="ttps://github.com/pr1ntf/iohyve"&gt;iohyve&lt;/a&gt; which is a FreeBSD (what FreeNAS is based on) &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhyve"&gt;bhyve&lt;/a&gt; manager.  Byhve is a hypervisor that runs on FreeBSD, basically like KVM (which I've been using) or OpenVZ (which I've used with VPS hosting), or Xen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bhyve is for FreeBSD what KVM is for Linux.  And this is where the sysadmin/tinkerer/geek in me thinks "cool" and away disappears a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this post/tutorial, you need to be running FreeNAS 9.10 (you can probably do this easily enough with FreeBSD, but I've not tried).  There is also documentation on &lt;a href="https://doc.freenas.org/9.10/jails.html#using-iohyve"&gt;Using iohyve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From your FreeNAS system you need to know your ethernet interface name (in the web UI go to &lt;strong&gt;Network -&amp;gt; Network Interfaces&lt;/strong&gt;, in my case &lt;em&gt;em0&lt;/em&gt;) and the storage pool name (&lt;strong&gt;Storage -&amp;gt; Volumes&lt;/strong&gt;, in my case the pool is named &lt;em&gt;storage&lt;/em&gt;).  The actual setup of iohyve needs to be done as root over SSH, so you'll need that running as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As root, we need to create the environment iohyve requires.   I used the following commands to create the pool for its use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# iohyve setup pool=storage kmod=1 net=em0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Setting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iohyve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;On&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FreeNAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;installation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Checking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;symbolic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iohyve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iohyve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Symbolic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iohyve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mnt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iohyve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;created&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kernel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;modules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;bridge0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;already&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;machine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Setting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;correct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sysctl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;up_on_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells iohyve to install the required ZFS datasets and kernel modules.  We use &lt;code&gt;kmod=1&lt;/code&gt; to tell iohyve to load the required kernel module, &lt;code&gt;pool=storage&lt;/code&gt; tells it which pool to use for files (in this case, &lt;em&gt;storage&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;net=em0&lt;/code&gt; sets up the network bridge to this interface (iohyve can only be bound to a single interface).  You can use multiple pools for iohyve, however I only have one pool on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to create a few tunables in FreeNAS.  Heading back to the web UI, go to &lt;strong&gt;System -&amp;gt; Tunables&lt;/strong&gt; and create the following two tunables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variable: &lt;strong&gt;iohyve_enable&lt;/strong&gt;, values: &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;, type: &lt;strong&gt;rc_conf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variable: &lt;strong&gt;iohve_flags&lt;/strong&gt;, values: &lt;strong&gt;kmod=1 net=em0&lt;/strong&gt;, type: &lt;strong&gt;rc_conf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;iohyve_enable&lt;/strong&gt; variable tells FreeNAS to load iohyve support at boot, and the &lt;strong&gt;iohyve_flags&lt;/strong&gt; are the same kmod and net options we used when setting up iohyve initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to download an ISO image for iohyve to use for installing a virtual machine.  In my case, I want to run CentOS 7.  There are plenty of &lt;a href="http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1611.iso"&gt;mirrors&lt;/a&gt; to choose from for the minimal ISO which is probably what you want since you can install any specific software required using yum after it's installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# iohyve fetch http://centos.mirror.iweb.ca/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1611.iso
Fetching http://centos.mirror.iweb.ca/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1611.iso...
/iohyve/ISO/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1611.iso/C100% of  680 MB    9 MBps 01m08s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to use iohyve to fetch the ISO image (somewhat annoyingly) so you can't just copy an existing ISO over (although I believe you can do a fetch over NFS or provide it locally via HTTP from another system on your network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the ISO downloaded, you can configure a new virtual machine.  Check to make sure you have the ISO available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# iohyve isolist
Listing ISO&amp;#39;s...
CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1611.iso
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, to create the machine with 20GB of space (the same size as my existing KVM machine for IPA, which is more than enough):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# iohyve create ipa-slave 20G
Creating ipa-slave...
# iohyve list
Guest      VMM?  Running  rcboot?  Description
ipa-slave  NO    NO       NO       Sun Mar 12 16:39:10 MDT 2017
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can configure the specifics of the machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# iohyve set ipa-slave ram=1G cpu=1 os=custom loader=grub-bhyve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Setting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Setting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cpu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Setting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cuscom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Setting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;grub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bhyve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sets my virtual machine to have 1GB of RAM, use one virtual CPU, use the "custom" operating system type (we need this later, even though we will be using CentOS 7), and uses the grub-bhyve loader which is required by Linux guests.  The &lt;a href="https://github.com/pr1ntf/iohyve/wiki"&gt;iohyve wiki&lt;/a&gt; has more details on operating system types and which values to use depending on which Linux operating system you intend to install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using a CentOS 7 guest, iohyve currently cannot boot from an XFS partition (which is the default), and due to the limitations of the commandline installer, we can't tell Anaconda to use something other than XFS.  Another thing I found, with some trial and error, is you want to use traditional partitions and not the LVM-based partition scheme (so plan out your filesystem in advance to ensure you have enough size!).  This is the main reason for using the "custom" operating system type.  We'll fix that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work around this, we'll use a simple kickstart file to get us to a minimal working system from which we can install the rest of what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make grub boot and use the kickstart file, you need to edit &lt;code&gt;/iohyve/ipa-slave/grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; so it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;linux (cd0)/isolinux/vmlinuz inst.ks=http://somewhere.internal/ks.cfg
initrd (cd0)/isolinux/initrd.img
boot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the &lt;code&gt;ks.cfg&lt;/code&gt; file would look something like (see the &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/sect-kickstart-syntax.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more info):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#version=RHEL7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# System authorization information&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enableshadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;passalgo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sha512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# Use CDROM installation media&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;cdrom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# Use text install&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# Run the Setup Agent on first boot&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;firstboot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ignoredisk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# Keyboard layouts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vckeymap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xlayouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting the installation, make sure you can retrieve that file with something like curl.  Next, start the installation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From another terminal, ssh into your FreeNAS server again in order to connect to the serial console by using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Starting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;automated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;..&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
...&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now sit back while it automatically installs.  This will be quite the minimal install, however it will get you up and running with an ext4-based system that iohyve can boot up, and from there you can install individual packages or package groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the install is complete, you will see something like this on the console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;[  OK  ] Started Restore /run/initramfs.
[  OK  ] Reached target Shutdown.
dracut Warning: Killing all remaining processes
Rebooting.
[  819.859124] Restarting system.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it's not actually restarting the system.  Switch back to the other console and you will see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unhandled ps2 keyboard command 0xf6

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; command, the virtual machine is not running even though it said it was restarting.  In order to start the machine, you must use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;If&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;terminal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;appears&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hanging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iohyve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;terminal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;complete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GRUB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now switch back to the original console (that you've not disconnected) and you will see the system booting.  I had some difficulty with dracut-initqueue warning about incessant timeouts, so it took some time for the system to boot and even then I ended up in a rescue shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As annoying as this is, it's not too terribly difficult to solve although I hate how hackish it needs to be.  The root of the problem &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to be that dracut wants to connect to this kickstart file before the network is up.  So we need to do some chroot shenanigans and fix the initramfs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# mkdir /mnt
# mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
# chroot /mnt
# cd /boot
# cp initramfs-3.10.0-514.el7.x86_64.img initramfs-3.10.0-514.el7.x86_64.img.bak
# dracut -f /boot/initramfs-3.10.0-514.el7.x86_64.img 3.10.0-514.el7.x86_64
# ls -al initramfs*
-rw-------  1 root root 45180381 Mar 14 08:24 initramfs-0-rescue-715baff9360a47a89af2ddbc55b9f0cf.img
-rw-------  1 root root 44766225 Mar 14 09:26 initramfs-3.10.0-514.el7.x86_64.img
-rw-------  1 root root 17437682 Mar 14 09:25 initramfs-3.10.0-514.el7.x86_64.img.bak
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging by the difference in size between the rescue image, the newly created image, and the previous one that was copied, this is a pretty strong indication that something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there are a few more steps to do before we can get CentOS 7 booted properly.  The first is to edit &lt;code&gt;/iohyve/ipa-slave/grub.conf&lt;/code&gt; and remove the kickstart reference.  I'm not 100% sure this is required after we perform the next action, but after a lot of beard-tugging (and to spare you the same) I'm suggesting you remove it.  Also, you need to set the operating system type back to CentOS 7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# iohyve set ipa-slave os=centos7
Setting ipa-slave os=centos7...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've stopped the virtual machine, great, if it's still waiting for network timeouts, you can forcibly stop it with &lt;code&gt;iohyve destroy ipa-slave&lt;/code&gt; and then we can use &lt;code&gt;iohyve start ipa-slave&lt;/code&gt; to start it back up again (this from the session not attached to the console, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on the console, you should be able to watch the virtual machine boot and arrive at a login prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you login, you probably want to install a few other things given we opted for the minimal install:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# yum update -y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# yum install net-tools vim-enhanced zsh ipa-server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# systemctl status sshd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last is to make sure that sshd is running so you can ssh in and carry on (at least for me, an 80x25 console is pretty darn tiny).  I also prefer the enhanced vim, and having tools like ipaddr and ifconfig are just plain old handy, and of course the whole point of this exercise was to set this up as an IPA server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, once you verify you can ssh into the server, disconnect from the console by typing the tilde and CTRL-D (so &lt;code&gt;~ + CTRL-D&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish up, let's give the virtual machine a decent description and tell it to start at boot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# iohyve set ipa-slave description=&amp;quot;IPA Slave server&amp;quot;
Setting ipa-slave description=IPA Slave server...
#  iohyve set ipa-slave boot=1
Setting ipa-slave boot=1...
# iohyve list
Guest      VMM?  Running  rcboot?  Description
ipa-slave  YES   YES      YES      IPA Slave server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can make a backup or snapshot of the virtual machine (which is one of the first things I wanted to do after all of the effort of figuring out the above!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iohyve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;snap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20170314&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Taking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;snapshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20170314&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iohyve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;snaplist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20170314&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there doesn't seem to be a way to remove snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't played with it enough to know whether or not the performance is better than KVM on Linux, but I enjoyed fiddling with this to get it figured out and working.  Hopefully this is helpful to others; there have been quite a few references to the desire to run CentOS 7 on FreeNAS using iohyve, but even the upstream site indicates it is currently not possible (although according to &lt;a href="https://github.com/pr1ntf/iohyve/issues/224#issuecomment-274279896"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;, it's on the roadmap).  With a bit of fiddling, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step now is to figure out how to get an IPA replication slave setup because the documentation is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; intuitive at all and setting up a replicated slave is about the only way to migrate IPA from one machine to another.  Wish me luck, and I hope this is helpful to people interested in running CentOS 7 with iohyve.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Bsd"></category><category term="iohyve"></category><category term="freenas"></category><category term="centos"></category><category term="ipa"></category></entry><entry><title>Replaced GPG Key</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/replaced-gpg-key.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-12T16:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-02-12T16:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2017-02-12:/blog/replaced-gpg-key.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quick note to indicate that I've revoked my old GPG key (key id &lt;code&gt;0x94BE833CE8B86CAB&lt;/code&gt;) and replaced it with my new one (key id &lt;code&gt;0xBD51CB9670DF9DE7&lt;/code&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;You know your wife is a keeper when she gets you a YubiKey 4 for your birthday!  I was really excited about this YubiKey because of its support
for storing your GPG private keys and also for an SSH private key, in addition to the U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) support.  I've been using
earlier versions of the YubiKey for OTP (one-time password) and U2F, but the new version was especially interesting to me because of the GPG support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus it's a new toy to tinker with, and I like nerdy little things like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got it, it was easy enough to associate it with the accounts I previously had my U2F-only YubiKey associated with and also others I previously had not and probably should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when it came to getting this setup for GnuPG I ran into some interesting things.  First off, I used this &lt;a href="https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide"&gt;YubiKey
Guide&lt;/a&gt; to get things setup (this is a great guide).  I did it on my Fedora laptop because from the things I
read it seemed that using Linux for the setup would be easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That guide is pretty Debian-specific when it comes to the software install, so on Fedora you want to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo dnf install ykpers libyubikey gnupg2 gnupg2-smime pcsc-list pcsc-lite-ccid
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating the new key on the laptop was easy enough with the instructions provided but I ran into problems writing the keys to the YubiKey.  I could
program the card as root, but as the user that generated the key I was unable to write the keys.  With a bit more hunting around, I found another
blog post about using the &lt;a href="http://stafwag.github.io/blog/blog/2015/06/16/using-yubikey-neo-as-gpg-smartcard-for-ssh-authentication/"&gt;YubiKey Neo as a GPG Smartcard for SSH Authentication&lt;/a&gt; and realized I needed to give myself access to write to the card via udev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editing the &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/69-yubikey.rules&lt;/code&gt; file to add myself as an owner of the device did the trick and now it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;ACTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;add|change&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;GOTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;yubico_end&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Udev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;letting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Yubikey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Yubico&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Yubikey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ATTRS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;idVendor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;1050&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ATTRS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;idProduct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;0010|0110|0111|0114|0116|0401|0403|0405|0407|0410&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;OWNER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;[me]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ID_SECURITY_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;LABEL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;yubico_end&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then reloading the configuration using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;udevadm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;udevadm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I could finish with the original tutorial and get the keys written to the card.  Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought.  Once this was done, the U2F logins were no longer working.  Plugging the YubiKey into my mac and trying to use it as the
second factor with some of the sites it previously worked with was no longer possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this was already a few hours of work, I went off to eat dinner and watch a show with the family.  When that was done, as often happens when
you give your mind something else to think about, it occurred to me that the command in the original tutorial about changing the mode of the YubiKey might have had something to do with it.  The original tutorial indicates that to configure the YubiKey you needed to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ykpersonalize -m82
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking out the manpage, it seems that this mode of 82 sets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MODE_FLAG_EJECT (which is the 80)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OTP/CCID composite device (which is the 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess earlier YubiKeys did not enable CCID which is what we need for GPG support.  But guess what's missing?  Right, the U2F support.  We need mode 6, which is for OTP/CCID/U2F.  So running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ykpersonalize -m86
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fixed the problem and now U2F works again (as does GPG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next problem I had was that, while GPG worked fine on my Fedora laptop, when I tried to do &lt;code&gt;gpg2 --list-secret-keys&lt;/code&gt; on my mac, it was telling me there were no secret keys.  Using &lt;code&gt;gpg2 --card-status&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;gpg2 --card-edit&lt;/code&gt; worked fine, and they even showed those card slots occupied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the heck?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out GPG 2.1 uses a different format for storing key information that GPG 1.x and 2.0 don't support or understand.  And MacGPG2 for the mac is currently providing 2.0.30 which didn't understand this stuff.  And it turns out that fink (which I use for all the extra Linux-like commands and updated CLI tools that I like) did not provide GnuPG 2.1.  As a result I switched from fink to HomeBrew because it provides GnuPG 2.1, which I found from &lt;a href="https://www.rempe.us/blog/yubikey-gnupg-2-1-and-ssh/"&gt;Yubikey, GnuPG 2.1 Modern, and SSH on macOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still some work to be done to clean a few things up.  I need to publish my new GPG key once I'm confident with it, and have signed it with
my existing key, and revoked the old key.  Then I need to put the new SSH pubkey on those servers that are critical and I want the higher security on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what I had to do to get this setup was already out there (thank you citizens of the internet!) but there were a few gotchas that others may
stumble on and since I couldn't easily find any answers (maybe I'm the only one that tripped over the ykpersonalize, or maybe most people use these for GPG/SSH and not also U2F, I have no idea).  Hopefully this will be helpful for anyone stuck in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick notes on some macOS-specific things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a MailMate user (awesome email client) but the suggestion of using a command-line pinentry program causes it to crash because it can't get input from anywhere.  You want to &lt;code&gt;brew install pinentry-mac&lt;/code&gt; first, and then use that as the pinentry program for the gpg-agent.  My &lt;code&gt;~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf&lt;/code&gt; file now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;enable-ssh-support
use-standard-socket
pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac
default-cache-ttl 600
max-cache-ttl 7200
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also want to uninstall MacGPG2 if you have it installed.  You can re-install it if you want, as it does have some nice tools, but if you do be sure to select "Customize" on the installer and de-select "GPGMail" and "MacGPG2" (basically install "GPGServices", "GPGKeychain", and "GPGPreferences" only).  I don't know if the GPGMail plugin will work with GnuPG 2.1 (I don't use Apple Mail and MailMate doesn't need it) so maybe you don't need to remove it (and I can't be bothered to find out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, I had this working fine with two macs and my Fedora laptop, but when I tried it on another mac a day or two later it did not want to work.  I finally figured out that it was because when I started fiddling with this, on the first two macs I had gnupg 2.1.17 but on the other mac it pulled the new version (2.1.18) from homebrew.  This new version does not play well with the YubiKey.  I filed &lt;a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions/issues/1522"&gt;this bug&lt;/a&gt; against homebrew but then after some more digging I found it was actually &lt;a href="https://bugs.gnupg.org/gnupg/issue2933"&gt;this upstream bug&lt;/a&gt; so hopefully 2.1.19 will fix the problem.  I note it here only because it had me scratching my head for a few days going through my setups wondering if I had done something wrong on the last mac.  Once I installed 2.1.17 on that one, everything worked peachy.  Talk about whacky timing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Ang for this awesome birthday present!  =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been spending a lot of time thinking about this past year and all of its challenges and accomplishments, the moments of growth and clarity, the opportunities taken and the opportunities missed.  I'm not one to get deeply personal in public, and won't get into a lot of the nitty gritty as I write this, but the end of a year is an opportunity to look back and do some self-reflection.  I'm a firm believer that if you don't know where you came from, you'll have no idea where you're going.  I've come to learn that &lt;em&gt;perspective&lt;/em&gt; is key in a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a very interesting year for me, personally, and for my family.  There has been a lot of stretching and a lot of growth.  There have been some hard times and some &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard times, but there have been some awesome times as well.  The security industry is probably going to note 2016 as the year of "the suck" (for a lot of really valid reasons!) and it would be easy for me to get sucked into the same doom-and-gloom point of view, especially when I consider all of the personal stuff this year brought.  But I am an eternal optimist (although I've not always been so) and so I don't look at 2016 as "the suck" but "the stretching".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a work perspective, this year has been challenging.  At Red Hat we have been doing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of stuff, and within Product Security we have had a lot on our plate.  The growth of branded high-visibility flaws has been a real challenge to manage.  And manage it we did, sometimes not as well as we would have liked or hoped, but in the end we accomplished what we set out to.  There were some really big projects (and a lot of little ones) that kept us busy with the aim of streamlining, enhancing, and strengthening the work that we do.  This was incredibly challenging and I can honestly say that I don't think I've worked harder in my life than I have this year.  This was a period of significant growth for me personally as well, and a lot of personality quirks needed to be dealt with.  I absolutely need to thank the folks I work with for being some of the most awesome people on the planet.  I have peers that are amazing and the folks that report to me... well, I would not want to work with anyone else.  You guys blow my mind and you know who you are.  If any of you wander across this and read it, know that I highly value each and every one of you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to go to the Czech Republic twice this year and meet with most of my guys and this is something I thoroughly enjoyed.  I'm not a big fan of travel and it's quite the hike to get there, but again, I get to hang out with some awesome people and work on some amazing things.  Hopefully I have the opportunity to head back again soon as I really enjoyed spending time with these guys and weekly video chats just don't cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So work this year was &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; but in the end, I'm glad it was hard.  Strength through adversity and all that jazz right?  Growing and learning.  I've read a ridiculous number of management books this year and try to put these things into practice and with it comes a lot of uncomfortable self-examination.  Things that are easy to ignore or overlook when you're doing purely technical work (which I don't anymore, in fact I don't seem to be doing much hands-on technical stuff at all anymore).  These are, however, a critical mirror when you're dealing with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also retired as the "IT guy" from the church this year which I've been doing on a regular basis for the last five years and an irregular as-needed basis for the five or so prior to.  That was a huge change as well, but allowed me to focus on more important things like my work with Red Hat, my family, my work as a marriage counsellor and district pastor.  Ultimately it gave me back a lot of time, so while that was a very hard decision to make, I'm glad for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a non-work front, thirteen months ago we "adopted" a 17 year old and had her come and live with us.  Her story is her's to tell, so I'm not going to get into the how or why she became part of the family, but suffice it to say this was one of those situations where God was clearly at work.  Having a 17 year old come and live in our home (our daughter was 14 when she moved in) was one heck of a challenge.  Everything was turned upside down as we adjusted to living with not just another person, but one we were responsible for and who needed us.  And when I look back over the last thirteen months, I realize we needed her as well.  Obviously not in the same ways, but she brought things to our home and our lives that caused us to stretch and grow.  We live and think a certain way and our ways were not her ways and so there was a bit of a "culture clash" that caused all of us to grow and develop that under-used skill called &lt;em&gt;perspective&lt;/em&gt;.  She moved out a few days ago (she's 18 now) to make a go of life as an adult on her own (she calls it "adulting").  And while this is sad, it's also exciting.  I'm excited to see what she does with her life.  I'm excited to see if those late night conversations made a difference.  I'm excited to see what comes of the foundational changes and opportunities God has given her, and He's given her plenty of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, God gave us a young lady to take care of but in 2016 He gave us a forever daughter and I'm immensely grateful for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this year I've been thinking a lot about my faith and service to Jesus Christ and what that means on not just a personal level, but a practical one as well.  I've had the opportunity to speak at church on a variety of occasions in the last few years and I felt led to share some of that outside the confines of the church walls.  And that's where the podcasts come in.  I have no idea where they will go or what will happen with them, but I'm making and taking the time to speak to those who are interested in listening and whatever God wants to do with it is up to Him.  I've written about my faith here and there in this blog, but now I'm going to speak about it as well.  I don't plan on a particular cadence, but as things come up with counselling or things that I read, I'll be taking the time to talk about it, not just write about it.  I think this is especially important in our day where a lot of Christians are going off the rails and are doing and saying things that are not in line with the Bible we profess to believe says to say or do.  I don't think a lot of people who call themselves Christians read their "instruction manual" and find themselves in places they were never meant to go.  So my hope is to bring some clarity to that confusion as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, fair warning, if you're not interested in the Bible, you probably want to avoid the podcasts.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on.. so much has happened this year.  It has literally been a crazy year and looking back on it I'm amazed at just how much got jam-packed into 365 days.  It seems like such a small amount (it's only 2.5% of my life or 5% of my productive adult life).  Some people I know can't wait for 2016 to be over and done with (hang on! it ends tomorrow!) with almost a superstitious zeal that writing a 7 instead of a 6 will make everything magically better.  2017 will come with it's own challenges and opportunities for growth -- of that I am certain.  Looking back on 2016... I'm grateful for the challenges and the opportunities.  I am not the same man on Dec 30 as I was on Jan 1 and for that I am thankful.  Zechariah 4:10 tells us not to despise the day of small beginnings, and if your beginnings seemed small in 2016, know that often they are the essential building blocks, foundation stones, to greater things in the future.  We all start off small but we almost never end that way if we are committed to the growth process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God bless and Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="yearend"></category></entry><entry><title>Using GitLab CI to deploy to remote host over ssh</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/using-gitlab-ci-to-deploy-to-remote-host-over-ssh.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-08T18:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-12-08T18:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2016-12-08:/blog/using-gitlab-ci-to-deploy-to-remote-host-over-ssh.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/gitlab.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been using GitLab for a while now and I really like it.  I can't objectively say whether it's better than GitHub or not (I have a few projects on GitHub but I rarely make any changes to them and even more rarely use the web UI), but one of the things I appreciate about GitLab is the fact that I can run my own copy of it and store my own stuff in it.  I also use it every day for work and at home so am much more familiar with it than GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been playing with the CI aspect of GitLab.  I've used Jenkins to handle "CI duties" in the past, and GitLab and Jenkins work quite well together, but I wanted to play around with GitLab's built-in CI because of how tightly integrated it is (and since I run a small GitLab here at home, I can use the same system for my runners and don't have to worry about setting up Jenkins).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it quite easy to setup, although there are a few things to be aware of and I wanted to note them here.  Partly so if I need to do it again in the future it'll be easy for me to refer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the user to run the service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# groupadd -g 2001 otter
# useradd -u 2001 -g 2001 -d /srv/www/otter -s /bin/bash otter
# chmod 0711 /srv/www/otter
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above creates the "otter" user and group which will run the service and makes &lt;em&gt;/srv/www/otter&lt;/em&gt; traversable since we will checkout the git repository (as user otter) and it will live in &lt;em&gt;/srv/www/otter/otter/&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# su - otter
$ mkdir otter
$ cd otter
$ git clone https://[gitlab-url]/otter.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is public so there is no need for authentication.  If you had a private project you could still authenticate over HTTPS by creating a &lt;em&gt;~/.netrc&lt;/em&gt; file that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;machine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab-host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gitlab-user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this I added the otter user to &lt;em&gt;/etc/sudoers&lt;/em&gt; to be able to restart the otter.service but that didn't work out so well.  When I used the following in &lt;em&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;otter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;cd otter &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git pull &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo /bin/systemctl restart otter.service&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the CI does not allocate a pseudo-terminal, which is ultimately required for sudo (even though we set up the private key without a password), the deployment failed.  This means that while we can deploy the new code via calling &lt;strong&gt;git pull&lt;/strong&gt;, we cannot restart the gunicorn daemon that is serving the content.  A work-around for this is to setup a cronjob to run every minute and look for a specific file, since we can easily do something like &lt;strong&gt;touch /srv/www/otter/otter.restart&lt;/strong&gt; with our ssh call after doing the git pull.  So editing &lt;em&gt;/etc/crontab&lt;/em&gt; and adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;* * * * * root test -f /srv/www/otter/otter.restart &amp;amp;&amp;amp; /bin/systemctl restart otter.service &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rm -f /srv/www/otter/otter.restart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;does the trick.  This actually is a bit nicer than trying to use sudo because it's still only root that can restart the service and given &lt;em&gt;/srv/www/otter&lt;/em&gt; is writable only by the otter user, and outside the git repository, nothing else that isn't either a root or otter process can create the file.  This removes the need to change anything in &lt;em&gt;/etc/sudoers&lt;/em&gt; or give this user any kind of special permissions.  The downside is this will add an entry every minute to &lt;em&gt;/var/log/cron&lt;/em&gt;, but change the threshold to whatever you want (i.e. use "*/5" to check every 5 minutes if preferred).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this, the &lt;em&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/em&gt; file was updated to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;otter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;cd otter &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git pull &amp;amp;&amp;amp; touch /srv/www/otter/otter.restart&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are other considerations that can and should be done here.  For instance, if you have database changes, the above isn't sufficient for an automatic deployment so a script to make changes to the database as part of the deployment would probably be good.  This could be an external script or something that your systemd initscript handles, or the web application itself.  One thought that comes to mind is to use a table in the database for configuration information and store a version in the database that can be compared and if less than what the script expects, automatically perform the migration at start.  (Note to self, I should implement this...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, the full &lt;em&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/em&gt; file looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;centos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;stages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;before_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;yum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;which&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is handled using a project variable in GitLab which can be set by going to the project in question, clicking the gear icon and selecting "Variables".  You want to add a variable named &lt;strong&gt;SSH_PRIVATE_KEY&lt;/strong&gt; with the contents of a private key you generate.  The corresponding public key would be added to the &lt;em&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/em&gt; file for, in this case, the otter user on "production.host".  You can read more about &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/variables/README.html" target="_blank"&gt;GitLab variables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and I mention this because I found using systemd's initscripts a little bit painful at first (especially with mod_uwsgi, which is why I opted to use gunicorn and mod_proxy instead, see &lt;a href="https://annvix.com/blog/current-progress-of-new-blog-platform"&gt;my earlier blog post about this&lt;/a&gt; for more details), I leave you with the service scripts.  There are two scripts in question, the &lt;em&gt;otter.socket&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;otter.service&lt;/em&gt; scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;otter.socket&lt;/em&gt; sets up the listeners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;otter socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Socket]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ListenStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/run/otter/socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ListenStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;0.0.0.0:5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Install]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;WantedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;sockets.target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;em&gt;otter.service&lt;/em&gt; runs the gunicorn service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;otter daemon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Requires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;otter.socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;After&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;network.target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Service]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;PIDFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/run/otter/pid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;otter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;otter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/srv/www/otter/otter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExecStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/srv/www/otter/otter/flask/bin/gunicorn --pid /run/otter/pid --access-logfile /srv/www/otter/otter.log app:app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExecReload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExecStop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/bin/kill -s TERM $MAINPID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;PrivateTmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Install]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;WantedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;multi-user.target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These files need to live in &lt;em&gt;/etc/systemd/system/&lt;/em&gt; and are enabled using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# systemctl enable otter.socket
# systemctl enable otter.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a &lt;em&gt;/etc/tmpfiles.d/otter.conf&lt;/em&gt; for the socket file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;d /run/otter 0755 otter otter -
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which can be setup using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# systemd-tmpfiles --create
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd want to do that before starting the services for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this is helpful for someone who is interested in running a Flask application as a service under systemd with some CI integration using GitLab.  It covers a little bit more than just using GitLab CI to deploy remotely, although all the pieces are tied together and it seemed odd to focus on the one part of the picture without giving some details on the rest to make things work.  One thing I did consider is making the systemd services to be user services so that the otter user could &lt;strong&gt;systemctl restart otter.service&lt;/strong&gt; but I didn't really get around to it and it didn't really matter to me (perhaps something to fiddle with in the future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love any feedback or ideas for improvement.  This is all pretty new to me yet so undoubtably there are ways these can be implemented better, but this works and I felt like sharing.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="gitlab"></category><category term="ci"></category><category term="docker"></category></entry><entry><title>Countdown to SHA1-based HTTPS Doom</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/countdown-to-sha1-based-https-doom.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-11-22T22:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-11-22T22:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2016-11-22:/blog/countdown-to-sha1-based-https-doom.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So it's been noted in a few places that 2017 is the year that SHA1 for HTTPS is doomed.

&lt;p&gt;Most sites today don't use SHA1-based SSL certificates (which is good) and there are sites you can go to in order to easily check if your public web site is using one, such as &lt;a href="https://shaaaaaaaaaaaaa.com/"&gt;shaaaaaaaaaaaaa.com&lt;/a&gt;, but what about internal services?  You can't really point an external web site to an internal resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few sites out there that explain how to do it, but as I had to poke at a few things internally myself I figured it was worth sharing the simple script I wrote to check.  Cut-n-paste the following into something like sha1checker.sh and run it.  It will tell you if you're using a SHA1-based certificate or, if not, tell you what is used (hopefully "sha256WithRSAEncryption"):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

site="${1}"

if [ -n "${2}" ]; then
    port="${2}"
else
    port="443"
fi


algo="$(openssl s_client -connect ${site}:${port} &lt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null | openssl x509 -text -in /dev/stdin | grep 'Signature Algorithm')"

if [ "${algo}" == "" ]; then
    echo "Unable to load certificate!  Invalid hostname (${site}) or port (${port})"
    exit 1
fi

if [ "$(echo ${algo} | grep -q sha1; echo $?)" == "0" ]; then
    echo "Vulnerable, using SHA1"
else
    echo "Not vulnerable"
    echo "${algo}"
fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy enough to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sh sha1checker.sh annvix.com 443
Not vulnerable
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not perfect (it seems to wig out with the version of openssl provided with macOS unless you're using a version supplied with Fink, but it works well on Linux).  Now is probably a good time to check this stuff out before you end up locked out of some essential web services come January.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="openssl"></category></entry><entry><title>From There to Here (But Not Back Again) - 15 years of Red Hat Product Security</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/from-there-to-here-but-not-back-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-24T07:53:00-06:00</published><updated>2016-10-24T07:53:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2016-10-24:/blog/from-there-to-here-but-not-back-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/shadowman-tattoo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today marks one month that my "work time" is 100% devoted to Red Hat; last month I "retired" from any of the IT/web work for my church that I've been doing for the last 12 or so years.  It's been an interesting month being able to spend time on things that I want to spend on outside of regular Red Hat work hours.  =)  My rediscovered and available time has been spent fiddling around the house dealing with things I never really had time to get to in quite a while, and some on computer-related things that I've wanted to do but never had the time to do.  One of the things on this long todo list was to do some "security reviews" of passwords and related things (GPG keys, SSH keys, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review became a bit more pressing for two reasons: macOS Sierra ships with a version of OpenSSH that does not use DSA keys by default, and a former client of mine phoned me two weeks ago because they were phished for $150k and he was looking for help.  The latter reminded me that it's good to review the landscape every once in a while and keep up to date with changes, the former was the impetus to actually do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the DSA key change, and because (to my chagrin) I still used such a key for a few hosts, I decided to do some cleanup of my SSH keys first.  To maintain compatibility with some older hosts that may not support newer key types like ECDSA, I opted to create a new 2048 bit RSA key for use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "user@host"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the real fun began when I had to remember where the old keys were being used and updating them.  I had a half-dozen SSH keys of various types (DSA, 1024 bit RSA, 2048 bit RSA) and decided to consolidate things and cleanup my ~/.ssh/known_hosts and ~/.ssh/config files as well.  I started primarily with making a clean ~/.ssh directory and backing up the old one so I can still keep it for those hosts I'm likely to have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, when you upgrade to macOS Sierra it overwrites /etc/ssh/sshd_config and /etc/ssh/ssh_config so I had to make changes there with respects to kerberos authentication.  The options are the same; basically you want to set &lt;b&gt;GSSAPIAuthentication yes&lt;/b&gt; in both config files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-checked my GPG key and it's a 3072 bit RSA key, so doing alright there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the coming days is to update passwords on some sites where it's not been changed in a long time.  I use 1Password (you could use any password manager you like) so I have distinct and unique passwords on each site, but some of them are a bit weaker than I would like.  One nice feature of 1Password is the "Security Audit" section that lists passwords that are weak, duplicates, and then those that have not been changed in a while (broken down in 3+ years old, 1-3 years old, and 6-12 months old).  Thankfully the weak password count is fairly low, but the 3+ year old list is a bit higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people recommend changing passwords often, but I disagree with this.  For instance, whenever you change your password you introduce some risk (is the site currently compromised?  are you?  is there someone listening on the wire as you make the change?) so there are some instances where it makes sense, but if you're rotating passwords every 3mos or so I have to wonder what the point is (and point out that you're actually increasing risk when you do).  So use a good password or passphrase, make sure they are different for each site (so a compromise of one doesn't compromise you on another, etc.).  Having said that, it's good to change passwords every once in a while.  The security policy of the site may have changed -- maybe when you first signed up they kept passwords in plaintext for some insane reason, and in a later software update they started storing it properly, or maybe they used to store the password as a weak md5 hash and have since moved to a stronger sha256.  The point is, even though your password may have been strong, you don't know how they have stored it on the remote side and in a lot of these cases, you're at their mercy even if you use a good password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can almost always tell if the remote end has bad security policies by doing the "forgotten password" request... if they send you your password, you might want to move on from that site entirely (a server should not be able to send you your password in plaintext!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the sites you use offer two-factor authentication (sometimes called two-step authentication) I do recommend using it.  Sometimes it's a pain, but (as in the case of this former client) using two-factor authentication would have kept someone from accessing his email account and convincing his bank to wire a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of money out of the country.  The idiocy of the bank aside, this is a pretty costly reminder that some really smart people can do some really creative things to steal a buck, and some other (equally smart or not nearly as smart, you decide) people can get suckered.  How that bank handled that situation was &lt;i&gt;beyond&lt;/i&gt; ridiculous, which sort of drives home the point that ultimately it's up to you to be your own advocate and first line of defence.  Good passwords, good security "know how", and just plain old being smart (don't click random links in email, people!) are really the best things you can do to save yourself a lot of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while there is a balance between security and convenience, with some things (like 1Password) you can get a measure of both.  And education... education is important.  We as humans are really good at learning about the things that matter to us... healthy eating, responsible money management, and so on... we need to drive home the message that security is important and it starts with the individual and their computing habits.  As security professionals, we almost need these horror stories to shock people into action but it seems like when the horror stories come in rapid succession, we tend to filter them out.  These things becoming "normal" is not ok.  Humans tend to minimize how awful something is unless it happens to them.  And sometimes we need bad things to happen more than once to really drive it home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an illustration, a neighbour had a drive die and the last time this happened a few years ago I helped him get sorted out with a backup system and made it quite clear how important it was by sharing my own experiences.  However, over time, the backups happened less and now those pictures, financial information, and other things are... poof... gone.  He's an example of being bit, perhaps not hard enough the first time, but hopefully hard enough &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; time.  I've been bit once (hard!) and I would gladly pay the cost of multiple redundant backups than deal with that kind of data loss again.  I suspect this time he will too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that isn't really security-related, per se, I think it's probably something that people can appreciate due to their own experiences -- when it comes to some of the damage that comes from security breaches or information theft, I don't want people to have those experiences!  So while we can't fully control what information we provide to a site that may or may not get exposed, we can certainly try to reduce the damage and we should.  I've spoken to homeschool groups about exactly this and I was probably more shocked overall than they were!  They were shocked at all the naughty stuff that can happen and I was shocked that they didn't know even the half of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could keep going (maybe I should, maybe a multitude of voices shouting from the rooftops that this stuff is actually serious will make a difference), but I'll stop here.  Suffice it to say that while I think there is a great, and growing, responsibility on site owners to protect their customers and users, the sad reality is these things are based on software written by humans and humans make mistakes.  I've been doing security response work for over 15 years now and while certain things become better, other things are horribly, &lt;i&gt;horribly&lt;/i&gt; broken (don't even get me started on IoT!) and we have a lot to do to fix them and educate the coders of the future on how &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to write these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since there will always be users, we need to educate them so that they know the risks and how best to minimize them.  We can try, and often succeed, in keeping users safe, but it only takes one crack in the armor and then it becomes a matter of minimizing damage and the user who has prepared for this (because it &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; happen) will be much better off than the user that didn't or, even worse, didn't even realize it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Consumer Christianity</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/consumer-christianity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-11T14:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2016-09-11T14:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2016-09-11:/blog/consumer-christianity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="https://vdanen.github.io/images/food-man-person-eating.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we held a "Ministry Fair" at the church that serves to highlight the many ministries within our church as a way to highlight the sorts of things we do and also to allow others to volunteer and serve in particular areas where we have need.  As I stood at my station, I began to think about the church and why I, with my family, attend and serve... and it caused some interesting reflection that I wanted to share here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my firm belief that one of the biggest problems within the church today is that it has become an institution that seeks to change God for the sake of people, rather than to change people for the sake of God.  It has become "seeker friendly" and so much so that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been watered down to the point that it is indistinguishable from real Biblical truth.  It isn't hard to see... turn around and look at what many churches today preach, teach, and "sell" to people who come in the doors.  Instead of calling people to serve God, the church starts to serve the individual.  Instead of the church calling individuals to serve the body (which is the church and members of the Christian community, and also all mankind), it seeks to become more palatable to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of Dietrich Bonhoffer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did we get to this point?  The church used to be something that people gave their lives for (and, in many parts of the world, still do) but here in North America we equate the church to nothing more than a drive-through fast food joint.  We have become a McDonalds for the soul.  A Subway for the spirit.  To me, the obvious answer is that churches want more people, and I believe most have good intentions here.  The more folks who come through the doors, the more people who will have that encounter with Jesus and ultimately start down the road of relationship with Him that leads to eternal life.  Sure, some churches are thinking that more people mean more finances and they are financially driven although I don't think this is most churches (undoubtably there are more than a few that would fall into this kind of motivation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question I have for these churches that are willing to water down the message to get more people in the door is: what do you do with them once you have them?  If your lure to get people into the church is to preach messages about how much God loves you (He does) and how much He wants to bless you (He does), and how much it's all about &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; (it isn't really) then what do you do about the flip-side of the gospel that is just as important, if not more so?  If you spend all your time talking about these things and then toss in a message about repentance, about obedience, self-sacrifice, loving your neighbour like yourself, putting God first above all things... if you don't preach these things as part of the "whole package" then the people you brought in with the "it's all about you, baby" message will vote with their feet and walk because this new message isn't what drew them in to begin with.  So what are the chances these things will reach the pulpit?  Probably little chance because the fear will be that you've changed the menu and you've changed what they came for with something they need, but don't really want.  We can't be "bait and switch" churches because that doesn't work and deceives people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are we left with?  Starting of as peddlers of cheap grace and staying that way.  Or we can preach a full gospel and stay true to it, showing integrity and honesty and deceiving no one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is a real fear in a lot of churches today.  If they start preaching a &lt;i&gt;full&lt;/i&gt; gospel, who is going to stick around to hear it?  Sure some will, but for those who came to the church because it met &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; needs, when those needs are no longer met, they'll leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the essence of consumer christianity.  Thomas C. Reeves, in his book &lt;i&gt;The Empty Church&lt;/i&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Christianity in modern America . . . tends to be easy, upbeat, convenient, and compatible. It does not require self-sacrifice, discipline, humility, an otherworldly outlook, a zeal for souls, a fear as well as love of God. There is little guilt and no punishment, and the payoff in heaven is virtually certain. What we now have might best be labeled ‘Consumer Christianity.’ The cost is low and customer satisfaction seems guaranteed.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn't the way the church was supposed to operate and as a Christian, this isn't how we're supposed to view the church.  There are two main points here:  the first is that the church has to stop catering to people and be what it was actually meant to be, what God designed it to be.  The second is that people have to stop looking at church as something that caters to their needs and making it all about their wants and desires.  I believe that if the second happens, the first will also.  But some churches just need to make the decision that, even if it means people leaving, they will preach a full gospel truth -- not watered down, not manipulated, and certainly not absent.  Why?  Because Jesus asked us to make disciples, not patrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christians, the church was not meant to serve our needs.  We were meant to serve the church, to be obedient to the call of God.  In Luke 9:23-34 (TLB), Jesus says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then he said to all, “Anyone who wants to follow me must put aside his own desires and conveniences and carry his cross with him every day and keep close to me! Whoever loses his life for my sake will save it, but whoever insists on keeping his life will lose it;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to understand that sometimes we won't get what we want.  We need to understand that sometimes the pastor will preach a message that digs a little deep and makes us uncomfortable and that it isn't a license to leave to find somewhere else that preaches something a little softer.  We need to be ok with change and that sometimes people will rub us the wrong way and instead of looking for the exit, realize that we have a place here and maybe, just maybe, this is a good opportunity for growth.  The church is called the Body of Christ and we don't get to define what that looks like.  God calls us, and has designed us, to be a part of one body.  In 1 Corinthians 12 the Bible talks about the body and how we are necessary parts of it, and in Colossians 1:18a the Bible tells us that Jesus is the head of the body:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He is the Head of the body made up of his people—that is, his Church—which he began
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see that it's not up to us to determine whether or not we belong, whether or not we should leave, whether or not it meets our needs.  Instead, we need to know that we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; belong, we should only leave if the Lord directs us elsewhere (after all, He places us where He wishes), and we need to start thinking about meeting the needs of others rather than just being in it for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have been attending Christcity (started back when it was Bethesda Christian Fellowship) for about 18 years now.  We have seen pastors move on to other churches, we have seen many friends leave for a variety of reasons, and we have seen people who have remained loyal to that body of believers much longer than we have.  In fact, today we honoured the retirement of our Treasurer who has served faithfully for 46 years.  I can honestly say that remaining this long has not been without it's challenges!  Some of the people who have moved on have been very dear friends and it would have been so easy to leave with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that my wife and I understood and acknowledged that God planted us in that church 18 years ago and we don't have the option of leaving until He says so.  This isn't about loyalty to one pastor, or even one building.  It's about loyalty to the God who said "this is where you belong" and understanding that God commands blessing when we remain in unity (Psalm 133).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we have, and God has rewarded us immensely for remaining faithful to the place God has called us.  But even more than that, we don't come to the church as consumers, we come to the church as contributors.  When we come as contributors, yes, we consume, but we also take part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can easily be compared to the open source ecosystem.  There are many consumers of open source (in fact, a whole lot of what you use today, whether you realize it or not, is effectively consumed open source software, be it your phone, TV, router... heck, even your toaster).  There are, comparatively, few contributors.  And yet the contributors to open source will tell you, time and time again, that contributing to open source makes all the difference and there is great satisfaction to be had.  In fact, I'd say that open source contributors believe "it is better to give than to receive" because they know they will receive so much more than they contributed, because they are able to reap the fruit of the labours of others who, like themselves, contributed to something that was bigger than just "me".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the church is meant to be.  We are meant to be partakers, to partner with God and the church He designed.  We are meant to serve.  We are meant to walk alongside our brothers and sisters in Christ.  We are meant to be active parts of the body.  And we are meant to be loyal and committed to the body, in the same way two people are committed in marriage.  I find the imagery of Christ and His Bride so potent because Jesus has made commitment to the church in the same way a husband does to his bride, and the church is meant to have that same level of commitment to her Husband.  And we, in turn, are meant to have the same level of commitment to both the Bride (church) as members of the body, and to the Husband (Jesus) as the Bride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll wrap this post up with Acts 20:28-35 (TLB) as a warning for both those who lead the church and for those who are a part of the church:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“And now beware! Be sure that you feed and shepherd God’s flock—his church, purchased with his blood—for the Holy Spirit is holding you responsible as overseers. I know full well that after I leave you, false teachers, like vicious wolves, will appear among you, not sparing the flock. Some of you yourselves will distort the truth in order to draw a following. Watch out! Remember the three years I was with you—my constant watchcare over you night and day and my many tears for you.

“And now I entrust you to God and his care and to his wonderful words that are able to build your faith and give you all the inheritance of those who are set apart for himself.

“I have never been hungry for money or fine clothing— you know that these hands of mine worked to pay my own way and even to supply the needs of those who were with me. And I was a constant example to you in helping the poor; for I remembered the words of the Lord Jesus, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”

&lt;p&gt;I was on holidays a few weeks ago and decided to replace an aging Mac Pro that I had been using as a Plex server with a new FreeNAS box, since I could run a jail with Plex.  So I used the four 3TB WD Red drives in the Mac Pro with another two new similar drives to construct a new FreeNAS box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the problem with those four drives I used as a base was that they were already four years old, but since they still seemed to be working well enough and it would save me about $600, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, yesterday FreeNAS helpfully told me that one of the drives was failing.  I'm not a stranger to systems administration, having done it for the better part of 20 years, and I'm certainly not a stranger to replacing failed drives, but... FreeNAS (based on FreeBSD) is a bit different than what I'm used to (I'm a Linux guy, I can deal with &lt;code&gt;mdadm&lt;/code&gt; and others no problem).  Couple this with the fact that I'm using ZFS in a RAIDZ2 configuration and... this is all new to me, thus this entry.  If nothing else, it gives me something to refer down the line but hopefully it is found useful by others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using FreeNAS 9.10.1 and while the error alert and emails are nice, they don't give me much to go on.  Especially when the web UI tells me that the zpool is degraded but doesn't actually tell me which drive has the problems.  When I navigate to &lt;b&gt;Storage&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;Volumes&lt;/b&gt; - [mount point] - &lt;b&gt;View Volumes&lt;/b&gt; you can select the volume name (in my case it is "storage") by clicking on it and at the bottom of the page you will see three new icons, the last of which is &lt;b&gt;Volume Status&lt;/b&gt;.  Here you can see the physical device that is failed, in my case with a DEGRADED status.  You can also view this information by using the commandline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@heimdall] ~# zpool status storage
  pool: storage

    attempt was made to correct the error.  Applications are unaffected.

errors: No known data errors
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So from the above I can see that my &lt;b&gt;storage&lt;/b&gt; zpool is in a degraded state and it tells me that the device &lt;code&gt;gptid/ee870fb3-4be5-11e6-9152-3497f634fc9c&lt;/code&gt; is the culprit.  That isn't a drive identifier and I can't see in the zpool manpage a way to make it show me the device.  So I have to use a different command and since I have the gptid, I can weed out the things I don't care about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@heimdall] ~# glabel status | grep ee870fb3
gptid/ee870fb3-4be5-11e6-9152-3497f634fc9c     N/A  ada2p2
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is helpful!  So I know that the device that is degraded and has too many errors is /dev/ada2.  Checking this out with smartctl shows me no useful information -- it has not failed any SMART tests.  I even ran long and short SMART tests after the fact, in a different machine, to see if it was actually dying and smartctl tells me that both tests completed without error.  But, given the age of the drive, it's probably due a replacement anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're pulling the drive, unless you've labelled the drives physically, you'll need to identify them by serial number.  The smartctl tool can show you this, or you can use camcontrol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@heimdall] ~# camcontrol identify ada2|grep serial
serial number         WD-WMC1T0421516
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doc.freenas.org/9.10/freenas_storage.html#replacing-a-failed-drive"&gt;FreeNAS documentation will tell you how to replace a failed drive&lt;/a&gt;.  Effectively, you just need to power off the system, pull the failed drive and replace it with a new drive and reboot.  Once you have done this, navigate back and find the OFFLINE disk (it will be the one with a series of numbers rather than a device name) and click the &lt;b&gt;Replace&lt;/b&gt; button and select the new device (should be the only one on the list).  Since this drive is entirely new and unpartitioned, you'll need to force the replacement.  After that, it's just a matter of sitting back while the volume performs the resilver operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're using an encrypted volume (I'm not) you have a few more steps to take that the documentation describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you've done this, you'll be able to see the estimate of how long it will take to resilver with the zpool command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@heimdall] ~# zpool status -v storage

&lt;p&gt;In my case, it took over 3 hours.  I just went to bed and when I got up, it was back online and in good state.  Really really easy.  Thank you FreeNAS!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Bsd"></category><category term="freenas"></category><category term="raid"></category></entry><entry><title>Current progress of new blog platform</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/current-progress-of-new-blog-platform.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-05T16:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2016-08-05T16:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2016-08-05:/blog/current-progress-of-new-blog-platform.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've not had much time in the past week to work on the blog platform due to getting back to work after two weeks off.

So that means future enhancements to the blog will take a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to implement a fairly basic commenting system that works well, so at least now you can offer your thoughts and comments on blog posts.  The one thing that's really missing before I redirect the old linsec.ca site to here is searching.  I think search capabilities are quite important.  Flask can do this with Whooshalchemy, which would be awesome except I opted to use Peewee (which we use at work in a few places, so it helps me learn it better) rather than SQLAlchemy.  It also looks like you can do full text search quite easily if you were using SQLite but alas, I'm using MySQL on the backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it looks like the next step is to write something that uses Whoosh for searching, but also integrates with Peewee (in a way that Flask-WhooshAlchemy would).  I might look into writing something quick-n-dirty from scratch, or I might poke at Flask-WhooshAlchemy and see if there might be a future Flask-WhooshPeewee... you never know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone on the interwebs has figured this out already though, I would be really keen on hearing what you have to say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue that currently bothers me a little bit is the UWSGI integration.  Because I'm using mod_proxy_uwsgi and running this site as a UWSGI application, I have a systemd unit file to run it, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[Unit]
Description=annvix.com flask uwsgi server

[Service]
Type=forking
WorkingDirectory=/mysite/flask
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash -c 'cd /mysite/flask; source flask/bin/activate; /mysite/flask/flask/bin/uwsgi --ini /mysite/flask/annvix.ini'
RuntimeDirectory=/mysite/flask
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whenever I run &lt;code&gt;systemctl start annvix-flask&lt;/code&gt;, it sits for a &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; time before releasing to the console and the systemctl status show it as "activating":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# systemctl status annvix-flask

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing that I've read explains why this might be the case.  It works, the site is obviously running, but systemd thinks it's still activating  and when it finally releases it's saying it has timed out.  This is a cheap plea to smart folks that may have the answer (although if I do figure out why it's doing this, I'll be sure to use the new commenting feature to share the answer).&lt;/p&gt;

I've been using Drupal to host annvix.com for quite some time (mostly for consulting client information) and have used WordPress for years on linsec.ca.  To be quite honest, I'm tired of Drupal, Wordpress, and PHP in general so I set out to try something new.  I have been using Flask at work now for some applications and am &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; enjoying web applications written in Python using the Flask framework.  I'm not a PHP expert by any means, but PHP lost it's appeal for me many years ago when I got around to learning Python and now... Well, I just really don't want to do anything in PHP anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also tired of updating Wordpress and Drupal and having to install poorly maintained and insecure modules in order to use that fraction of functionality that I want.  I was working on a redesign of my church's web site, written in Python, and decided to do the same for myself.  So this is the fruit of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's by no means perfect and it has a lot of things missing (i.e. no comment support yet).  I'm ok with the odd error 500 and things that go oops because it gives me a chance to learn and play with things outside of work, something that has been sorely lacking for quite some time.  It also lets me play with things that I wouldn't be doing in a work context, like fiddling with the Twitter and Flickr APIs and some other things that aren't really required when you're working on CVEs or OpenSCAP or internal dashboards, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also taken this opportunity to migrate content from the linsec.ca blog to here (all of the documentation, which was previously on Mediawiki, has already been done... the blog entries themselves go back quite a few years so I'll get around to going pre-2013 as I get to it).  I guess this is the "great consolidation" of content into one place with one platform that I get to write from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, apologies in advance if this is a bit rough around the edges.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well, I won't be restricting myself on what content I produce.  Previous blogs and articles have been pretty much strictly tech-related, but while that's still very interesting and important to me, my faith is even more important and that's where a lot of my conversations these days lead so why not talk about it in an open forum?  There are so many misconceptions about what true Christianity is, and so many people I talk to that have preconceived notions about "religion" and "faith" that, while my aim here is not to convert anyone, perhaps I can use this platform to at least educate or enlighten people.  Instead of believing something without critically thinking about or considering it (the very same accusations typically tossed at Christians), maybe get to understand or know it a little bit better.  This seems to be a fundamental flaw in society today.  We all want to be understood but take very little time to bother to understand.  This isn't just my complaint in regards to Christianity, this is my complaint when it comes to Linux (how many people never give it a chance because they &lt;b&gt;assume&lt;/b&gt; they know what it is and what it can and cannot due without ever even trying it?).  This is the complaint that Muslims have when the majority assumes all Muslims are extremists.  This is the complaint that members of the LGBTQ community have when many assume they are deviants.  This is the complaint teenagers have when parents assume they understand what their kids are going through without even bothering to talk to them and actually listen to them.  The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't something specific to Christianity, or to "religion".  This affects all walks of life.  And if you don't take the time to try to understand, you'll miss what the real truth is, and you'll miss all kinds of opportunities.  So, moving forward, I will attempt to do that for anyone who cares to understand what true discipleship looks like, and what James refers to as "true religion" which I firmly believe many so-called "Christians" today have either forgotten, or never learned to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, this is the reason why I will not be syndicating content to Fedora Planet like I had with my old blog and as the content will vary widely from just Linux and would thus be inappropriate for Fedora Planet)&lt;/p&gt;

It has some neat integration with some applications, like Sublime Text and PyCharm (both of which I use), but not for Komodo IDE (which I also use).  So this post is to show how easy it is to integrate the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash uses a URL scheme of &lt;pre&gt;dash://[query]&lt;/pre&gt; that makes it really easy to tie into any application that can callout to such URLs.  You can use URL scheme pretty much anywhere.  For instance, if you wanted to search for "os.getpid" (a Python function) you could type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ open dash://python2:os.getpid
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the commandline in the Terminal and it will open Dash, searching in the Python docset, for this function.  We will make use of that capability in our Komodo IDE toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to create a new toolbox item of the type "Command".  The only things we need to do here is give it a name (like "dash lookup"), set the command to "open dash://%W" and check off the "Do not open output pane" (since there won't be any output).  Finally, on the "Key Binding" tab, assign a new key binding; I chose CTRL-H since that mimics what Sublime Text uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/static/uploads/komodo-toolbox.jpg" alt="komodo-toolbox" width="502" height="600" class="img-responsive" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when your cursor is on a function or item in your Python code, or if you highlight something (this is represented by the "%W" in the command), hitting CTRL-H will open Dash and display search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, you're like me, you probably have a lot of docsets installed in Dash and probably don't want to search all of them when you're working on your code.  If you're working on Python, which is what I pretty much exclusively write code in, you wouldn't want search results for bash or git commands to show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash has this nice way of allowing you to restrict what docsets are searched based on what the former foreground application was (or the application that triggered the search).  So in our case, we want to restrict what we search in Dash when we launch it from Komodo.  When you click on the magnifying glass icon next to the search field in Dash, the following search profile editor pops up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/static/uploads/dash-search.jpg" alt="dash-search" width="637" height="475" class="img-responsive"  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I created a new search profile called "Komodo" and ensured that it's active only when Komodo becomes active.  And then we can add which docsets to search.  In this case, I only want to search the Flask, Jinja, and Python 2 docsets as well as the Python Format Strings cheatsheet.  This allows me to search for things that are relevant to what I use Komodo for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have as many search profiles as you like; you could define one for Sublime Text depending on what you use it for, you can define one for the Terminal (the aforementioned shell and git docsets would be a good candidate for searching from there), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, because I find this useful also, if you want to search for something in Dash from the commandline, you could create this script to do that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat ~/bin/dash

#!/bin/sh
if [ "${1}" == "" ]; then
    echo "I need an argument to launch dash with"
    exit
fi
open "dash://$@"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dash pretty much just wants a single argument for the most part so something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ dash "vagrant suspend"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;only shows you search results for "vagrant".  In this case you could type "vagrant:suspend" to have it search for the "suspend" command in the "vagrant" docset alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash is pretty neat and I'm enjoying using it as an easy reference tool.  Using it has tidied up my browser window and I feel more productive with it and I really like how easy it is to summon it from almost any program that I'm using.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="dash"></category><category term="documentation"></category><category term="komodo"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Bye Bye Mediawiki</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/bye-bye-mediawiki.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-16T22:08:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-01-16T22:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2016-01-16:/blog/bye-bye-mediawiki.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note to say that I've shifted things around and have put most of the mediawiki content on as pages on the blog.

I'm working towards migrating from IPA in a KVM-based virtual machine running CentOS 6 to one running CentOS 7 and the way of making serial consoles work in 7 is different than it was in 6 because CentOS 7 (and thus RHEL7) use Grub2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of editing /boot/grub.cfg, you need to edit /etc/defaults/grub and add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
GRUB_TERMINAL="serial"
GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --unit=0 --speed=115200"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above will enable Grub output to the serial console.  Next, change the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX command to the following so you can use "virsh console" to connect to the guest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rhgb quiet console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have saved the file, you need to recreate the grub.cfg file with grub2-mkconfig:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, reboot the system and you should be able to use "virsh console [VMNAME]" to have a serial console to the guest.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="grub"></category><category term="kvm"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting started with firewalld</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/getting-started-with-firewalld.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-15T20:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2015-08-15T20:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2015-08-15:/blog/getting-started-with-firewalld.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly writing this for my own reference as I spent a bunch of time figuring this out while I was on holidays with some serious oVirt misadventures and didn't document any of what I did, so since I had to reinstall CentOS 7, I'm stuck doing this all over …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly writing this for my own reference as I spent a bunch of time figuring this out while I was on holidays with some serious oVirt misadventures and didn't document any of what I did, so since I had to reinstall CentOS 7, I'm stuck doing this all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively I'm migrating from CentOS 6 to CentOS 7 and trying to take advantage of the new way of doing things.  I could easily switch things to use /etc/sysconfig/iptables (that I can handle pretty much in my sleep) but it feels a bit like cheating, so I want to figure out firewalld which is to me a totally alien way of handling my firewall rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say that there may be better ways of doing this (and, to you the reader, probably far better tutorials), but this is how I went about it.  This is on a CentOS 7.1 system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing is to make sure firewalld is running and will run.  It should be the default but never hurts to check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# systemctl status firewalld
firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; &lt;b&gt;enabled&lt;/b&gt;)
   Active: &lt;b&gt;active&lt;/b&gt; (running) since Sat 2015-08-15 18:21:30 MDT; 18min ago
 Main PID: 745 (firewalld)
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, it's active and enabled (in particular pay attention to the enabled bit that is bolded above) so on a reboot it will come up.  firewalld has this concept of &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FirewallD#Which_zones_are_available.3F"&gt;zones&lt;/a&gt;, so you can set certain ethernet interfaces to be assigned to a particular zone.  The default zone is public, but as this is an internal DNS/DHCP/web server for my LAN, I want to set it to the internal zone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --get-zones
block dmz drop external home internal public trusted work
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=internal
success
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to make sure that the one ethernet interface on this machine, enp2s0 (so long eth0!) is assigned the same zone.  I believe this would happen by default, but it doesn't hurt to be explicit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --change-interface=enp2s0 --permanent
success
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can see how this zone is configured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --list-all
internal (default, active)
  interfaces: enp2s0
  sources:
  services: dhcpv6-client ipp-client mdns samba-client ssh
  ports:
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports:
  icmp-blocks:
  rich rules:
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a lot there right now and it's definitely setup to be a workstation, not a server.  You can see the available list of services that come pre-defined (they are XML files in /usr/lib/firewalld/services) by using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --get-services
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to examine any of the listed services, just look at the XML file.  For instance, /usr/lib/firewalld/services/dns.xml looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&amp;lt;service&gt;
  &amp;lt;short&gt;DNS&amp;lt;/short&gt;
  &amp;lt;description&gt;The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to provide and request host and domain names. Enable this option, if you plan to provide a domain name service (e.g. with bind).&amp;lt;/description&gt;
  &amp;lt;port protocol="tcp" port="53"/&gt;
  &amp;lt;port protocol="udp" port="53"/&gt;
&amp;lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward.  When adding new services or rules, firewalld makes them temporary, in that they will persist until a reboot or service restart.  You need to use the "--permanent" option to, well, make them permanent.  Since this server is going to do DNS/DHCP/HTTP/HTTPS we need to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=http
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=https
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=dns
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=dhcp
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --reload
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --list-all
internal (default, active)
  interfaces: enp2s0
  sources:
  services: dhcp dhcpv6-client dns http https ipp-client mdns samba-client ssh
  ports:
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports:
  icmp-blocks:
  rich rules:
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above we added four services: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and DHCP.  We then reloaded the rules (so as to apply them) and then listed the internal zone where we can now see our new services are enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to enable a service for which no default service definition exists, you can create one in /etc/firewalld/services/ as an XML file (copy a similar one from /usr/lib/firewalld/services/ and adjust for your service).  If you're using SELinux, be sure to run &lt;code&gt;restorecon -Rv /etc/firewalld&lt;/code&gt; and make sure the XML file has 0640 permissions and is owned root:root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of making a new service, however, you can simply add ports to the configuration which might be easier.  For instance, if I wanted to expose apcupsd but didn't want to make a service I might do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --add-port=3551/udp --permanent
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --add-port=3551/tcp --permanent
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --reload
success
[root@thor dhcp]# firewall-cmd --zone=internal --list-all
internal (default, active)
  interfaces: enp2s0
  sources:
  services: dhcp dhcpv6-client dns http https ipp-client mdns samba-client ssh
  ports: 3551/udp 3551/tcp
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports:
  icmp-blocks:
  rich rules:
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief, managing the firewall is a little bit annoying to do this way compared to the old way of "vim /etc/sysconfig/iptables; service iptables restart" but I can understand why it's done this way now.  It's quite modular and adaptable and allows you to make temporary changes to the firewall easily without having to know iptables commands.  There are a lot of commands, and since firewalls tend not to be things you tinker with often, they may not be overly memorable (thus deciding to write this after my second time of doing it in as many weeks as I didn't remember a darn thing).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="centos"></category><category term="firewalld"></category><category term="iptables"></category><category term="rhel"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Tell me your secrets</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/tell-me-your-secrets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-15T17:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2015-08-15T17:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2015-08-15:/blog/tell-me-your-secrets.html</id><content type="html">&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qr_peAIQU8k?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

While AdBlock works great on my browsers, that doesn't transfer well to mobile devices and apps with built-in advertising, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you're running your own BIND DNS server at home, you won't be able to do this.  If you have a home network with named running (my local network does) and unless you restrict all outbound DNS and allow DNS lookups only from your named server (which I do, it forces all of the machines on the system to use my DNS server which is configured to only ask OpenDNS for DNS info), this also won't really work for you (at least not in the way that I've done it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this assumes some knowledge of BIND and networking.  This is not so much a tutorial on how to configure BIND as it is some quick tips and shared info on what I did this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you need to setup a master zone.  Mine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
zone "rpz.linsec.ca" {
        type master;
        file "master/rpz.linsec.ca.zone";
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; You may also need the following in your &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; section, but I'm not 100% sure as it was there before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    response-policy {
        zone "rpz.linsec.ca";
    };
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes anything defined in this zone to be considered authoritative, just like the DNS settings I have for my local network.  As an aside, you can use this to block entire domains (like youtube or facebook if you have kids at home staring at screens all day...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then wrote a script which pulls data from &lt;a href="http://mvpshostsnews.blogspot.ca/"&gt;MVPS Hosts&lt;/a&gt;.  Their data is meant to be put into a hosts file, but that means it would only work on a single machine and I'm trying to solve a multi-machine/mobile issue, not just a single computer.  The script takes my rpz.linsec.ca.zone file and mashes in data from MVPS Hosts and to create a new file that we will use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
IFS=$'\n'

input=$(mktemp /tmp/mvps.hosts.XXXXXX)
output=$(mktemp /tmp/rpz.linsec.ca.zone.XXXXXX)
source="/etc/named/rpz.linsec.ca.zone"
serial=$(grep serial ${source} | awk '{print $1}')
n_serial="$(date +%Y%m%d)01"

curl -s http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt &gt;${input}

dos2unix -o ${input} &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

lines=$(wc -l ${input} | awk '{print $1}')

if [ ${lines} -lt 10000 ]; then
    exit 1
fi

for line in $(cat ${source}); do
    if [ "${line}" == ";START ADHOSTS" ]; then
        break
    else
        echo ${line} &gt;&gt;${output}
   fi
done

echo "" &gt;&gt;${output}
echo ";START ADHOSTS" &gt;&gt;${output}
for hostname in $(cat ${input} | egrep -v '^#' | awk '{print $2}'); do
    if [ "${hostname}" != "localhost" ]; then
        echo "${hostname}    IN    CNAME    ." &gt;&gt;${output}
    fi
done
echo ";END ADHOSTS" &gt;&gt;${output}

perl -pi -e "s/${serial}/${n_serial}/g" ${output}

rm -f ${input}
cp -f ${output} ${source}
rm -f ${output}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you need dos2unix installed.  Everything else is fairly standard.  The MVPS Hosts file seems to be updated monthly, so this something you could possibly add to a monthly cronjob or just run manually every once in a while.  So far it seems to work pretty good over here.  I had initially thought about writing something in python, but bash is just so much faster (for me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you put things in your zone file before the ";START ADHOSTS" line they'll be retained, so if you do want to block specific domains (you may want to block iadsdk.apple.com and qwapi.com if you don't want to see iOS iAd ads) you still can, and take advantage of the MVPS Hosts list (if someone has a better list, I would love to see it).&lt;/p&gt;

A few people missed it and wanted to know what I spoke about, so I'm sharing it here.  For those reading who may not "get it", this was delivered to Christians.  This isn't a message to anyone else.  There are a lot of "Christians" out there who were told a lie: That becoming a Christian is all about reserving a seat in Heaven and having God do "stuff" for you.  That is part of it, absolutely, but that's not the main thrust (or even really a large part) of what Christianity is about.  That lie makes Christianity all about &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; (a selfish thing) when the reality is Christianity is all about &lt;b&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/b&gt; (a selfless thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this really encourages Christians to continue walking the path that Jesus set before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 5, 2015:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had initially wanted to speak about the awesome majesty of our God, as it is something that has been burning in my heart for months now.  I believe God wants us to fully understand the greatness of who our King is, and He has been speaking this to us, as a church, through recent sermons and the exhortations of people like Julia and Don in the past weeks.   I could certainly say much of the same tonight, but I want to speak about how we serve this majestic King and Lord, and how we express our love to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible says in John 14:15 (AMP):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“If you [really] love Me, you will keep (obey) My commands.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in John 14:21 (AMP):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The person who has My commands and keeps them is the one who [really] loves Me; and whoever [really] loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I [too] will love him and will show (reveal, manifest) Myself to him. [I will let Myself be clearly seen by him and make Myself real to him.]”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question then becomes: do we love Him?  Because Jesus clearly says that there is exactly one expression of love towards Him: to obey His commandments.  Pop Christianity today would make God a common thing, one priority among many and that it’s ok to choose other things over God.  This can be in many areas of our lives: time, talent, and finances (or tithes).  Everything falls under these main areas.  Every day we have many options of how to prioritize our time, how and where we use our God-given abilities and talents, and what we spend our money on.  The world gives us many options on what to devote these things to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are important things to consider for three reasons.  The first is that it all comes down to directing them towards one of two people: do we use these things for our God, or for ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is that these are all things given to us, and the Bible calls us stewards or managers of the things God has given us.  So if we believe these things are given to us, by God, and we are stewards of them, then they don’t belong to us and we are not owners but simply managers.  So I ask you: How is our stewardship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, do we use these things in the light of Eternity, knowing that our existence on this planet is the blink of an eye or a drop in the ocean, and also keeping in mind that it is the only blink that counts and it is the single drop that defines what the rest of the ocean looks like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are sobering thoughts indeed.  We need to understand that it isn’t just what we say that matters.  God considers our words, our actions, and our motives.  All three need to line up.  The Bible has some very interesting things to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 17:10 NLT-SE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“But I, the LORD, search all hearts and examine secret motives. I give all people their due rewards, according to what their actions deserve.””&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James 2:14–17 NLT-SE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“What good is it, dear brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but don’t show it by your actions? Can that kind of faith save anyone? Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing, and you say, “Good-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well” —but then you don’t give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do? 
So you see, faith by itself isn’t enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Titus 1:16 HCSB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“They profess to know God, but they deny Him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified for any good work.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 John 3:16–18 HCSB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“This is how we have come to know love: He laid down His life for us. We should also lay down our lives for our brothers. If anyone has this world’s goods and sees his brother in need but closes his eyes to his need—how can God’s love reside in him?
Little children, we must not love with word or speech, but with truth and action.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a sampling of what the Bible says about our actions and motives.  God demonstrated His love to us by His actions: He sent His only Son, who had existed with Him for eternity, to earth, to teach us and then bear the full weight of God’s wrath against sin, God’s wrath that belonged to each of us.  He interrupted a relationship that had existed for Eternity &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; us, so that He could have a relationship in Eternity &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; us.  God did this for you, and He did this for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we understand that God loves us this much, then it’s not too much of a stretch to suggest that we owe God a debt we can never repay.  The great thing is that we don’t have to repay it!  God did not set out a number of homeless people we needed to feed, or a number of people we needed to bring to church, or a number of times we needed to read the Bible.  He didn’t give us a set of rules to keep, He gave us a lifestyle to live and a Saviour to accept as our own and devote our entire being to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 2:20 (NKJV) says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lifestyle includes loving God fully, which we’ve seen is demonstrated by keeping His commandments.  This is the lifestyle.  This new life we’ve received in Christ is not about us.  The old life, the sinful life, was about us.  This new life is all about Christ.  We are second to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we believe this, if we believe the Bible, if we believe the Truth that the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, places into our hearts and haven’t hardened ourselves to Him, then we know that coming to church is not a chore, or a duty, or something common.  We have the privilege of being in the Presence of the King of kings!  The Uncreated God of the universe desires the privilege of spending time with us in His House!  Giving our tithes in a Biblical way is easy.  If we believe that we are stewards of that money and God has given it to us then we should never look at it as giving 10% back to God.  We should always look at it as God graciously giving us the 90% to do with as we want or need and that 10% returned is simply a way to tangibly demonstrate our gratitude and thankfulness for the rest, and our obedience to His commands.  Proper tithing proves our obedience to God and don’t think for a second that God doesn’t know how to count!  Giving less demonstrates that we still put ourselves first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our time is likewise a gift from God, then we need to use it in a way that glorifies Him and advances eternity.  Do we show God gratitude for the time He has given us by “tithing” back our time and helping our “neighbour” (meaning everyone)?  Do we show God gratitude for the Church He has given to us and pour our time into it – not just for ourselves, but for others?  We need to realize that we don’t just come to church for our own benefit, but when we place ourselves here with a proper attitude of humility and reverence before God, He can use us to bless others around us.  And most importantly, when we come to church, we need to view it for what it really is: we are entering the Presence of Almighty God and ministering to Him.  Our praise, thanksgiving, worship, and prayers are our ministry before the Throne of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you tonight to be like David and Isaiah, every day, and see what God does with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms 51:10 (NKJV) says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Isaiah 6:8 (NKJV) says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: “Whom shall I send, And who will go for Us?”   Then I said, “Here am I! Send me.””&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My old git setup used the wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.icir.org/robin/git-notifier/"&gt;git-notifier&lt;/a&gt; script to send out emails and I &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; prefer the format it used than the format GitLab uses.  Unfortunately, at that time, without ponying up for the enterprise edition it didn't look feasible to change without some serious work that I didn't have the time or effort to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was looking at the latest version (7.6.2) and noticed the community edition support for &lt;a href="http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/hooks/custom_hooks.html"&gt;custom hooks&lt;/a&gt;.  After upgrading, I fiddled with it and git-notifier to try to make the two work well together.  With a little elbow-grease (git-notifier works well with straight git repos or gitolite) I got it to work, although it is a bit of a nuisance because, with regular git or gitolite, you can get some information from the repo exposed via the calling scripts and environment that does not seem to be present in GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow the instructions on the custom hooks document referenced above, you'll end up with something along the lines of /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories/&lt;group&gt;/&lt;project&gt;.git/custom_hooks (in my case it is /srv/git-data/repositories/&lt;group&gt;/&lt;project&gt;.git/custom_hooks).  In this directory (which must be owned git:git, including all its contents) lives a post-receive script which looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
repo_name="mygroup/myrepo"

base_dir="/srv/git-data/repositories"
git_host="gitlab.myhost.com"
send_from="mailer@myhost.com"
send_to="commits@myhost.com"

pushd ${base_dir}/${repo_name}.git &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

/srv/git-hooks/git-notifier $@ --link="http://${git_host}/${repo_name}/commit/%s" --sender="${send_from}"  \
  --mailinglist="${send_to}" --repouri="ssh://git@${git_host}:${repo_name}.git" --emailprefix="[git/%r]"

popd &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have git-notifier in a directory called /srv/git-hooks and it's owned root:root and mode 0755.  This will tell git-notifier to send an email to the $send_to address, from the $send_from address, and defines a few things like the repository itself and the host (all things that would normally be exposed via the environment in a git or gitolite setup but are lacking with GitLab).  But this can be used as a template and the only thing you should have to change is the value of $repo_name (everything else can be the same unless you need to define them differently per-repo or per-group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside to this is that you need shell access to set it up, which may prove troublesome for larger installations or shared environments.  For a personal or work environment this is probably an ok requirement.  Make sure that you disable the "Emails on push" service for the repository in GitLab or you'll get both the stock GitLab commitdiff email and git-notifier's email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm extremely grateful for those who contributed this support to GitLab as it means I spent a lot less time dorking around with this than I would have had I done it all myself, and while it was a bit of a nuisance to setup, it works quite well and I'm back to getting my old style of email notifications which are much more useful (for one thing, GitLab seems to have an upper size limit and if that is exceeded it sends no mail at all, whereas git-notifier will send you a list of changed files without the actual diff... a much more useful and meaningful email than sending nothing at all (if you look at git-notifier's changelog you'll see that was contributed by me in version 0.3-18, almost 2.5 years ago... that's how long I've been using git-notifier)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could contribute some sane code back to git-notifier to support GitLab, but without GitLab exposing things like the repository name or committer name to the environment I don't think it would be possible unless I've missed something non-obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="git"></category><category term="git-notifier"></category><category term="gitlab"></category></entry><entry><title>SSL Certificate Verification failure with fink's Python 2.7.9</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/ssl-certificate-verification-failure-with-finks-python-2-7-9.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-06T23:50:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-01-06T23:50:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2015-01-06:/blog/ssl-certificate-verification-failure-with-finks-python-2-7-9.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/"&gt;Python 2.7.9 was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a month ago and with it came some SSL-related changes (it backported the Python 3.4 ssl module and does HTTPS certificate validation using the system's certificate store).

This is our first week and the topic was &lt;i&gt;What does it mean to be a Christian?&lt;/i&gt;  The first thing we looked at was the Apostles Creed and the Nicene Creed, both of which &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/blog/2014/09/11/christian-statements-of-faith/"&gt;we've looked at here before&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm going to include the scripture we looked at and add emphasis to them, so when you see anything in bold those were the key phrases in the text we were looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Therefore, when many of His disciples heard this, they said, “&lt;b&gt;This teaching is hard!&lt;/b&gt; Who can accept it?”
Jesus, knowing in Himself that &lt;b&gt;His disciples&lt;/b&gt; were complaining about this, asked them, “&lt;b&gt;Does this offend you?&lt;/b&gt; Then what if you were to observe the Son of Man ascending to &lt;b&gt;where He was before&lt;/b&gt;? The Spirit is the One who gives life. The flesh doesn’t help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. But there are some among you who don’t believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning those who would not believe and the one who would betray Him.) He said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless it is granted to him by the Father.”
&lt;b&gt;From that moment many of His disciples turned back and no longer accompanied Him&lt;/b&gt;. Therefore Jesus said to the Twelve, “You don’t want to go away too, do you?”
Simon Peter answered, “Lord, who will we go to? You have the words of eternal life. We have come to believe and know that You are the Holy One of God!””
(John 6:60–69 HCSB (emphasis mine))&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage in John took place shortly after Jesus fed the 5000 (John 6:1).  After Jesus did a miracle and fed their bodies (their flesh, their natural and material hungers), they wanted to make Him their king, in an aim to displace the Roman authority that ruled over the Jews (John 6:15).  The Jews at that time viewed Messiah as one who would come and free them from the tyranny of the Romans; they thought He would be a &lt;i&gt;political&lt;/i&gt; authority rather than a &lt;i&gt;spiritual&lt;/i&gt; authority.  Jesus left them when He realized what it was they wanted to do because He did not come to setup an earthly kingdom -- that wasn't the point for His coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this passage, the reference to "His disciples" is not to the 12 who would later be the apostles.  Jesus, to that time, had many disciples -- people who followed Him and wanted to learn what He was teaching.  When these disciples, and the 5000 men (and probably at least another 5000 women and children) finally caught up to Him again, Jesus recognized they were looking for the food He could provide to their bodies more than the food He could provide for their spirits.  He called them out on it in John 6:26-27 and He followed this with the "hard teaching" which Jesus gave, indicating that He was the bread of life and that He had come down from heaven and described His mission to humankind (eternal life).  These people didn't want to hear any of this, they simply wanted a free meal and someone who would provide for them materially.  So His words offended them and many deserted Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is what a lot of Christians in North America do today: we sell Jesus as a provider of free lunches ("He will bless you!" or "Your life will be so good!" and so on) and yet we never mention the &lt;i&gt;cost&lt;/i&gt; of what it is to follow Jesus.  It would serve some Christians well to pay attention to this... Jesus didn't sell Himself cheap, and He didn't chase after those who left.  Jesus laid it out for them straight, and they found the teaching hard because it wasn't what they were looking for and they didn't understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C.S. Lewis defines Christianity as this, in his book "Mere Christianity":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Now the whole offer which Christianity makes is this: that we can, if we let God have His way, come to share in the life of Christ. If we do, we shall then be sharing a life which was begotten, not made, which always existed and always will exist. Christ is the Son of God. If we share in this kind of life we also shall be sons of God. We shall love the Father as He does and the Holy Ghost will arise in us. He came to this world and became a man in order to spread to other men the kind of life He has — by what I call "good infection." Every Christian is to become a little Christ. The whole purpose of becoming a Christian is simply nothing else.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While "Christian" does not necessarily mean "little Christ", I find it works quite well.  Truthfully, a number of commentators agree that "Christian" most likely started off as a derogatory term that would mean "follower of Christ" or "slave of Christ", both of which are not at all derogatory and really quite apt descriptions.  At any rate, our next few passages set out the call to be like (to imitate) Christ -- in a sense to become "little Christs".  In fact, Paul states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Therefore I urge you to &lt;b&gt;imitate me&lt;/b&gt;.”
(1 Corinthians 4:16 HCSB (emphasis mine))&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“&lt;b&gt;Imitate me&lt;/b&gt;, as I also &lt;b&gt;imitate Christ&lt;/b&gt;.”
(1 Corinthians 11:1 HCSB (emphasis mine))&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greek word &lt;i&gt;exakoloutheo&lt;/i&gt; means to follow out, to obey, or yield to.  Paul is urging the Corinthian church to imitate him as he imitates Christ, or to follow him as he follows Christ.  We as Christians are called to a live a life of imitation (of Christ), to be true disciples who see and do what our teacher shows us and asks of us.  Jesus is the standard that we set before us which is why it pains me (and should pain all true Christians) to see people who claim to bear the name of Christ acting in ways He never acted or say things that He would never say.  I suppose this could be because they are unfamiliar with what Jesus asks of us, or of how He would act in a given situation.  While all of this is clearly found in the Bible, too many people think the Bible unnecessary and don't bother to even crack open the book.  This is why Paul made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Remind them of these things, charging them before God &lt;b&gt;not to fight about words&lt;/b&gt;; this is in no way profitable and leads to the ruin of the hearers. Be diligent to &lt;b&gt;present yourself &lt;i&gt;approved&lt;/i&gt; to God&lt;/b&gt;, a worker who doesn’t need to be ashamed, &lt;b&gt;correctly teaching&lt;/b&gt; the word of truth. But avoid irreverent, empty speech, for this will produce an even greater measure of godlessness. And their word will spread like gangrene; Hymenaeus and Philetus are among them. They have &lt;b&gt;deviated from the truth&lt;/b&gt;, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and are overturning the faith of some. Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, having this inscription: 
The Lord knows those who are His, and &lt;b&gt;Everyone who names the name of the Lord must turn away from unrighteousness&lt;/b&gt;.”
(2 Timothy 2:14–19 HCSB (emphasis mine))&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The King James says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“&lt;b&gt;Study&lt;/b&gt; to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing &lt;b&gt;the word of truth&lt;/b&gt;.”
(2 Timothy 2:15 KJV (emphasis mine))&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul is talking about studying the Word of God, the result of which is approval from God.  This is the only way that God can trust us to know His Will and it is the only way that we can imitate Christ: by reading the Bible to see what it is that we are to imitate.  Paul doesn't call us to just imitate random people; he calls us to imitate people who themselves are imitating Christ -- the end result is that we too will imitate Christ.  The other point here is that we need to study so as to prevent ourselves from being led astray and also preventing ourselves from leading &lt;i&gt;others&lt;/i&gt; astray.  There is a great responsibility and accountability on those who teach the Word of God, so I fear for those who profess to teach "the Word of God" and don't read or study it.  They are certainly not approved to God!  And they are those of whom Paul also speaks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“But I fear that, as the serpent &lt;b&gt;deceived&lt;/b&gt; Eve by his cunning, &lt;b&gt;your minds may be &lt;i&gt;seduced&lt;/i&gt; from a complete and pure devotion to Christ&lt;/b&gt;. For if a person comes and preaches &lt;b&gt;another Jesus&lt;/b&gt;, whom we did not preach, or you receive a &lt;b&gt;different spirit&lt;/b&gt;, which you had not received, or a &lt;b&gt;different gospel&lt;/b&gt;, which you had not accepted, you &lt;b&gt;put up with it&lt;/b&gt; splendidly!”
(2 Corinthians 11:3–4 HCSB (emphasis mine))&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul clearly warns against false teachers who teach a different Jesus than the resurrected Jesus the apostles teach, or a different gospel than the gospel of Christ Jesus.  In an almost mocking/sarcastic tone he says "You put up with it &lt;i&gt;splendidly&lt;/i&gt;!", like they never even questioned it or compared it to what they were already taught and known.  Deceptive teaching is a very real danger -- it was then, and it still is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I am amazed that you are &lt;b&gt;so quickly&lt;/b&gt; turning away from Him who called you by the grace of Christ and are &lt;b&gt;turning to a different gospel&lt;/b&gt;— not that there is another gospel, but there are some who are troubling you and want to &lt;b&gt;change the good news&lt;/b&gt; about the Messiah. &lt;b&gt;But even if we or an &lt;i&gt;angel from heaven&lt;/i&gt; should preach to you a gospel other than what we have preached to you, a curse be on him!&lt;/b&gt; As we have said before, I now say again: If anyone preaches to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him!”
(Galatians 1:6–9 HCSB (emphasis mine))&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is most disturbing about the above passage that Paul writes to the Galatians is that this very same thing is evident today.  We have major religions today that were delivered by "an angel from heaven": Mormonism and Islam.  In Mormonism, the angel "Moroni" delivered the plates of the Book of Mormon to Joseph Smith and while the Book of Mormon claims that the Gospel is true, it was corrupted (something which has not been proven scientifically despite many critical attempts to do so).  So while Mormons are to read the Bible, the Book of Mormon is considered superior, as Joseph Smith said: “I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" id="ref1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  This book was delivered by an angel and taught a different gospel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the same is true of Islam, for Muhammad claimed that the Quran was delivered to him by the angel Gabriel&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn2" id="ref2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  The similarities between Islam and Mormonism are far more than just that they were delivered to their respective prophets by angels.  One other similarity is they both claim that the Bible (or more specifically the Gospel and the Torah) were, in their "uncorrupted" form, the Word of God and both the Quran and the Book of Mormon are further/final revelations of God to earth (see Surat '?li `Imr?n 3:3 &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn3" id="ref3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the LDS web site topic on the Bible&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn4" id="ref4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to wrap up, our final scripture which also talks about deceptive teachings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“If anyone teaches &lt;b&gt;other doctrine&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;does not agree&lt;/b&gt; with the sound teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the &lt;b&gt;teaching that promotes godliness&lt;/b&gt;, he is conceited, understanding nothing, but has a sick interest in &lt;b&gt;disputes and arguments over words&lt;/b&gt;. From these come envy, quarreling, slander, evil suspicions, and constant disagreement among people whose minds are depraved and deprived of the truth, &lt;b&gt;who imagine that godliness is a way to material gain&lt;/b&gt;.”
(1 Timothy 6:3–5 HCSB (emphasis mine))&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the point of the Bible study was not to poke at other religions, they were used as examples as to why it is so important to study and know the Bible so that when these other doctrines and "gospels" come about, or even when preachers are preaching from the pulpit, Christians who have the Word of God written on their hearts will know the truth.  The hope is that we will recognize the lack of truth in others, but also recognize any lack of truth in our own words and actions which contradict the example Jesus set before us to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scripture in question is Romans 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Receive one …&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I have not and will not participate in Halloween, and I personally do not believe that Christians should.  And while this posting talks about Halloween, it's not &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; Halloween itself.  It's about misinterpreting scripture to suit your own desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scripture in question is Romans 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful things. For one believes he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables. Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God has received him. Who are you to judge another’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand. 
One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks. For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living. But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written: “As I live, says the LORD, Every knee shall bow to Me, And every tongue shall confess to God.”
So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.”
(Romans 14:1–12 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scripture was quoted in reference to a Christian handing out candy at Halloween, and why they believe it's acceptable.  To them, Halloween is not about celebrating darkness and witchcraft, it's about celebrating children and candy.  They are interpreting the scripture above to say "it's fine for me to participate in Halloween because I get to interact with my neighbours, as a Christian I can hand out the best candy with the biggest smile on my face and don't judge me because I choose to do so ("eat all things") whereas you refrain from participating in Halloween ("only eat vegetables") and I have the freedom in Christ do so because I'm doing it for the kids".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with that kind of thinking (paraphrased above) is that it doesn't account for the context of the scripture quoted.  Paul isn't talking about certain tastes in food ("I like beef and you like chicken -- don't judge me for liking beef!").  He's not even referring to the Jewish custom of not eating certain foods (such as pork).  Rather, he's talking about food sacrificed to idols.  The food in question was for sale on the market after it had been sacrificed to idols, and people would buy it from the market, knowing it's origin, take it home and eat it.  Some Christians thought that the very act of eating this food that had previously been sacrificed to idols meant they were partaking in idolatry (which is something that Christians would very much want to avoid).  For some Christians, this was a very real problem and they would not want to be seen as being partakers in the practice, and for others they looked at it for what it was: food to be eaten.  Give thanks to God for the food, and eat, regardless of where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a definite problem with using this scripture to back the practice of Christians partaking in Halloween, and it's very much the "apples vs oranges" problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily, you cannot compare the act of handing out candy in the same light as eating food sacrificed to idols.  They are two very different stages in a somewhat similar process.  Rather, you need to compare eating this kind of food to eating the candy procured through Halloween activities.  So the question of eating meat versus eating vegetables is the same as whether or not you should eat candy given to you that someone &lt;i&gt;else&lt;/i&gt; obtained while out trick-or-treating versus refusing to eat it (because of the association to Halloween).  In other words, if my neighbour comes over the day after Halloween and offers me some of the candy they collected the night before, I have to ask myself this: Does eating this candy make me a participator in the festivities or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the act of handing out candy to children or taking your children out to collect candy from others can't be compared in the same way.  If we look at participation in Halloween as the sensitive issue today, then the sensitive issue when Romans 14 was written is the sacrificing to idols.  Perhaps it would be better to compare the &lt;i&gt;participation&lt;/i&gt; in either activity rather than the participation in one to the end result of the other.  Paul never compared the sacrificing of food to idols with the eating of this food.  For a Christian it would be a no-brainer: You don't sacrifice anything to idols.  So the &lt;i&gt;participation&lt;/i&gt; is not the focus because the answer is an unequivocal &lt;b&gt;NO&lt;/b&gt;.  Should that not be the same with this holiday originating in paganism and celebrated as the third most important day for Satanists today according to the Satanic Bible&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" id="ref1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether or not to partake of the treats obtained by &lt;i&gt;others&lt;/i&gt; who participated in Halloween should be the "freedom" that Christians need to think about and can use Romans 14 as a frame of reference.  You cannot use Romans 14 for the question of participation.  Instead, you should be using what Paul wrote to the Corinthians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? &lt;b&gt;And what communion has light with darkness? And what accord has Christ with Belial?&lt;/b&gt; Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell in them And walk among them. I will be their God, And they shall be My people.””
(2 Corinthians 6:14–16 NKJV (emphasis mine))&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this passage of scripture is the more appropriate question with some very definite answers.  There is nothing remotely Christian about Halloween and lame attempts to "Christianize" it to things like "Harvest Festival" are silly and were previously done -- in fact, the Catholic Church tried to Christianize Samhain to Halloween (or All Hallow's Eve) in the first place&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn2" id="ref2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Personally, I think they should have left well enough alone, like we should today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participating in Samhain&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn3" id="ref3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is something that, in my opinion, no Christian should be a part of.  In the same way that I don't think Christian missionaries in India celebrate Diwali, or Christians in Muslim countries celebrate Ramadan, I don't believe that cultural observances are an excuse to participate in something that is clearly not Christian.  And, to stem the comments of Easter and Christmas being "originally based in pagan holidays" I'd like to point out the obvious difference: Christmas is about celebrating the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ and Easter is about celebrating His death, burial and resurrection.  Regardless of what other holidays they may coincide with, there is an obvious meaning to the Christian that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; based on Christ.  The use of Christmas trees may be a point of contention with some, but I believe that falls under the freedoms we have in Christ.  The significance of the holiday is something very important to a Christian to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also point out that those of other faiths such as Hindus and Muslims don't celebrate Christmas just because they live in Canada, so I think that "cultural observances" is a pretty weak excuse to participate in something that, unlike Christmas and Easter, has absolutely nothing to do with God nor glorifies God in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main point of this article is not about Christians participating in Halloween.  As I stated before, I'm not one to judge.  I have many Christian friends who participate and I don't think any less of them.  I'm also not out to defend my right &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to partake.  The point of this posting was to dispel the faulty logic behind using Romans 14 as a prop to say that it's ok.  All of us have to account for our thoughts and actions and only God is judge, not me, nor any other Christian.  But if you are going to participate, just do it without trying to build a defence on scriptures that contextually cannot be used.  For further in Romans 14 it states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“So then each of us shall give account of himself to God. Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother’s way. 
I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. Yet if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died.”
(Romans 14:12–15 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of us will give an account, and we should be considering others as well as ourselves.  Here Paul is stating that if a Christian brother or sister is grieved by your desire to eat food sacrificed to idols then don't do it and so become a stumbling block to them.  I say this to those who advertise the fact they are participating in Halloween and defending their "right" to participate.  Rather, if you want to participate in Halloween don't make a big deal of it -- just do it.  I don't make a big deal of the fact that I don't, yet to anyone who asks I will let them know my belief.  In the same way, why make a big deal of the fact that you do, and then go on to justify it as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it is up to you.  I don't at all believe that participating in Halloween affects salvation in any way or that it makes you a "worse Christian" than if you didn't.  However, as Christians we should really be thinking long and hard about what James wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“You adulterers! Don’t you realize that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God? I say it again: If you want to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God.”
(James 4:4 NLT)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When they make statements like this, I know that they have not heard the real gospel of Jesus Christ, nor do they understand what Christianity is all about.  When people talk about how they hate "organized religion" and then lump Christianity (in the broad sense) in the same category, they miss what Jesus said.  Don't miss the context and audience to whom Jesus is speaking to when He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.”
(Matthew 12:34 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus also says to the religious leaders the following in this second passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell?”
(Matthew 23:33 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly Jesus is condemning their "form of religion" in the same way God did with the Israelites in the Old Testament:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Therefore the Lord said: “Inasmuch as these people draw near with their mouths And honor Me with their lips, But have removed their hearts far from Me, And their fear toward Me is taught by the commandment of men,”
(Isaiah 29:13 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scripture is also referenced by Jesus in Matthew 15.  The context is important in how Jesus quotes this, and in what He is trying to tell His disciples (those to whom the name "Christian" is later given):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying, “Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”
He answered and said to them, “Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? For God commanded, saying, “Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.’ But you say, “Whoever says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God”— then he need not honor his father or mother.’ Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: “These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me. And in vain they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ ”
When He had called the multitude to Himself, He said to them, “Hear and understand: Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.”
Then His disciples came and said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”
But He answered and said, “Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch.””
(Matthew 15:1–14 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees and the scribes were the leaders of the Jewish religion of the day.  These are the people who took the Mosaic Law (the Laws of Moses) and turned them into the &lt;a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/613.htm"&gt;Mitzvot&lt;/a&gt;, a list of 613 commandments.  Keep in mind that God gave the people ten commandments on Mount Sinai (see Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5).  It was upon these ten commandments that the law was based (in Leviticus) when God gave specific direction to the people.  What most people don't realize is that God was giving laws for both spirituality/morality, as well as the "laws of the land" (similar to how we have built-in moral laws, yet we also have the laws of our justice systems, such as adhering to speed limits).  God was establishing His covenant people in terms of both their spiritual lives and their natural lives.  Given that the Israelites were a people bound in slavery and had no laws of their own, other than the laws of Egypt (their slave masters), God needed to establish the natural/judicial laws by which the &lt;i&gt;nation&lt;/i&gt; of Israel would adhere to -- similar to those that a King would establish for his people (and in the strictest sense, until the time of King Saul, Israel was a theocracy with God as their sole king).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what the Pharisees had done was take those judicial and spiritual laws to a whole new extreme (thus the 613 commandments) and this was the burden to the people.  Jesus took the ten commandments and distilled them down to two essential laws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, “Which is the first commandment of all?”
Jesus answered him, “The first of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one. And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”
So the scribe said to Him, “Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He. And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”

Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” But after that no one dared question Him.”
(Mark 12:28–34 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Jesus was also referring to the burden of religion when He said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.””
(Matthew 11:28–30 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Christianity can be summed up in two commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Perfect love for God
&lt;li&gt; Proper love for man
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can ten commandments be expanded to 613, and then distilled down to two?  Being that I'm not Jewish, and that the Mitzvot is not in the Bible (and, likewise, considering Jesus' opinion concerning the weight of the burden the religious leaders were putting on people), I am only concerned with the ten commandments (see Exodus 20:2-17).  When you read the ten commandments it is easy to see that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Thou shalt have no other gods before me (perfect love for God puts nothing before Him)
&lt;li&gt; Thou shalt not make for yourself an idol (likewise, nothing comes before God)
&lt;li&gt; Thou shalt not take name of the Lord thy God in vain (using the Lord's name as a curse is not showing Him love)
&lt;li&gt; Remember the Sabbath, to keep it holy (loving God means to take the time to develop a relationship with Him)
&lt;li&gt; Honor thy father and mother (proper love for people means honoring them, particularly those God has placed in authority over you, such as parents)
&lt;li&gt; Thou shalt not kill (people don't kill people they love)
&lt;li&gt; Thou shalt not commit adultery (this is the ultimate betrayal, or dishonor, of your spouse that you love)
&lt;li&gt; Thou shalt not steal (people don't steal from people they love)
&lt;li&gt; Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour (people don't lie to, or about, people they love)
&lt;li&gt; Thou shalt not covet what belongs to your neighbour (material possessions or spouse, it doesn't matter; those things that belong to other people belong to them)
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, rightfully, the ten commandments can be distilled down to two, as Jesus did.  When Jesus condemned the religious leaders, He spoke these words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;““Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.”
(Matthew 23:27–28 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These words were spoken to them because they were concerned more with the &lt;i&gt;acts&lt;/i&gt; of men than with the &lt;i&gt;hearts&lt;/i&gt; of men.  To them, it was the works of righteousness, moreso than a humble heart, that God desired.  They put on masks (thus being called "hypocrites") so that they looked good on the outside, when on the inside they were more concerned with themselves and their positions of power than they were with actually obeying God.  It is for this reason that, when Saul did what looked good as opposed to what God commanded, that Samuel said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“So Samuel said: “Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, As in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, And to heed than the fat of rams.”
(1 Samuel 15:22 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's safe that, given all of the above, God is not interested in religion (as many define it today -- a set of rules you must live by), given how Jesus reacts to the Pharisees and religious leaders of His day.  Well known is John 3:16, which describes God's love for all humanity by sending His Son to be the sacrifice for our sins (&lt;i&gt;sin&lt;/i&gt; is defined as our disobedience and rebellion to God and His character, which are shown through His commands):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.”
(John 3:16–17 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.”
(1 John 4:10 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times in the Bible, God is referred to as the Father... not just as the Father of Jesus, but our Father as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;your Father&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!”
(Matthew 7:11 NKJV (emphasis mine))&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of God.  He is a Father to the fatherless (Psalm 68:5) and He is a Father to all.  The whole point of sending Jesus Christ to earth to die for us was to bridge the divide between God and man that our disobedience and rebellion caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even more than this, consider Jesus -- He is a part of the triune God and the Father asks Him to come to earth to walk among us and teach us (to reveal the heart and will of God to us), and He is willing to do it.  He shows not only His obedience to God (with whom He's had relationship with for all eternity), but His love for us.  What other King would step off His throne to die for those who are meant to serve and worship Him?  What God would abandon divinity to become mortal flesh and then die, not for friends, not for anyone deserving, not for anyone who's earned it -- not &lt;i&gt;despite&lt;/i&gt; us but &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; us?  Only Jesus Christ would do this, and He did it for &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;, so that we could have relationship with God the Father, as He had for eternity.  In fact, before being arrested and ultimately sent to the cross, Jesus prayed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;““I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word; that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me. And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me.”
(John 17:20–23 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire here is for the Father to have relationship with us in the same way that Jesus does.  When He says (paraphrased) "Father, You are in Me, and I am in You, and my prayer is for them to be one in Us and that the glory You gave to Me I have in turn given to them so that they can be united together as one in the same way that We are united together as One".  You cannot get any closer than to be united (which is to form as a unit or as a whole; a picture of this is the marriage covenant).  This is the closeness of the relationship Jesus desires with us -- so much so that in the Bible He is often referred to as the bridegroom and we (the church) as the bride.  Even in the Old Testament, God referred to the people of Israel as His wife (one such reference is Isaiah 54, another is the book of Hosea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bring this to a close, it's clear to me that if Jesus condemned the forms/burdens of religion that the Pharisees practiced, then it is not something that we should be engaging in (this is not, however, a license to "do whatever you want" because, while Jesus condemned this, He also instructs us to live holy and righteous before God (or, to put it another way, He expects us to be obedient children to God the Father)).  Christianity was not meant to suck the life out of people making them do "stuff", nor was it meant to be a burden we carried alone.  John 10:10 says that Christ came to give us abundant life.  It is also clear that Jesus would not step down from His throne to give His life for people He didn't care about and that His death for us was the highest expression of love that He could give us, and that God even asking Him to do so was the highest expression of love that God could give (after all, would we give up our children for random strangers we cared nothing for and who hated us?).  Would you do that for anything less than the hope of a relationship with the ones you gave so much for, and an intense desire to have that relationship in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if God simply wanted our obedience, He could have made us with no free will or capacity for choice.  For God to have a true and genuine relationship with us, He had to create us with free will and offer us the choice: love Me or reject Me.  Just as children demonstrate love and honor to their parents by obeying them, we as children do the same to our heavenly Father.  If I &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; my daughter do what I want and don't give her a choice, her "obedience" does not demonstrate love, it just shows good programming.  It is in the &lt;i&gt;choosing&lt;/i&gt; that we demonstrate love, so God had to create us with free will and the capacity for choice in order to have a genuine relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the word "religion" is not a dirty word as we have made it.  Almost 200 years ago &lt;a href="http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Home?word=Religion"&gt;Webster defined religion&lt;/a&gt; as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. &lt;i&gt;religion&lt;/i&gt; in its most comprehensive sense, includes a belief in the being and perfections of God, in the revelation of his will to man, in man's obligation to obey his commands, in a state of reward and punishment, and in man's accountableness to God; and also true godliness or piety of life, with the practice of all moral duties. It therefore comprehends theology, as a system of doctrines or principles, as well as practical piety; for the practice of moral duties without a belief in a divine lawgiver, and without reference to his will or commands, is not religion&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I think is a pretty reasonable and accurate explanation for what religion is.  In other words, when we seek to define our position in relation to Almighty God we must ask ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Who? God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and man
&lt;li&gt; What? Obedience to His commands
&lt;li&gt; Where? Everywhere
&lt;li&gt; When? Now!
&lt;li&gt; Why? Relationship
&lt;li&gt; How? Religion

In this posting, I want to explain some theological terms that every Christian should know (sadly if you ask most Christians what these terms mean you likely won't get a very good response). These terms and what they mean are most probably foreign to those who know nothing about Christianity (beyond what non-Christians describe, which is grossly inaccurate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what, exactly, does "redemption" mean?  Or "justification"?  Or "sanctification"?  These are big words that are core to the belief of any Christian.  I am going to define them in brief and give a scripture reference for each; the interested reader can follow the links to definitions in Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology which will explain these words in depth (looking at original Hebrew and Greek words with their meanings, further commentary and other scripture references -- I highly encourage taking the time to read it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words, and the meaning behind them, are fundamental to understanding the Christian message and worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gospel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; means "Good News" or "Glad Tidings" and refers to the message of salvation and new life offered in and by Jesus Christ.  To the Christian, being cleansed of your sins and having the assurance of eternal life in the presence of God is indeed good news!&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" id="ref1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“AND NOW let me remind you [since it seems to have escaped you], brethren, of the Gospel (the glad tidings of salvation) which I proclaimed to you, which you welcomed and accepted and upon which your faith rests, And by which you are saved, if you hold fast and keep firmly what I preached to you, unless you believed at first without effect and all for nothing. For I passed on to you first of all what I also had received, that Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) died for our sins in accordance with [what] the Scriptures [foretold], That He was buried, that He arose on the third day as the Scriptures foretold, And [also] that He appeared to Cephas (Peter), then to the Twelve. Then later He showed Himself to more than five hundred brethren at one time, the majority of whom are still alive, but some have fallen asleep [in death]. Afterward He was seen by James, then by all the apostles (the special messengers), And last of all He appeared to me also, as to one prematurely and born dead [no better than an unperfected fetus among living men].”
(1 Corinthians 15:1–8 AMP)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salvation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; means "rescue, set free, deliverance, escape, wholeness, healing, and safety".  When we receive salvation, we are released from the bondage of sin and are no longer slaves to the sinful nature that each human being is born with.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn2" id="ref2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [even] gave up His only begotten (unique) Son, so that whoever believes in (trusts in, clings to, relies on) Him shall not perish (come to destruction, be lost) but have eternal (everlasting) life. For God did not send the Son into the world in order to judge (to reject, to condemn, to pass sentence on) the world, but that the world might find salvation and be made safe and sound through Him.”
(John 3:16–17 AMP)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repentance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; means a complete change of direction in a person's life (for example, you are travelling north, then you turn around and travel south in the opposite direction).  It is a complete change of the mind, will and emotions away from sin and towards God.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn3" id="ref3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and He will have love, pity, and mercy for him, and to our God, for He will multiply to him His abundant pardon.”
(Isaiah 55:7 AMP)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redemption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the means by which salvation is achieved, by the payment of a ransom.  It literally means "to buy" and signifies the act of purchase in the market (in particular the slave market).  For a Christian, we are redeemed, or have received redemption, from being slaves to sin and through the purchase of ourselves with the precious blood of Jesus Christ on the cross.  He paid &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; debt to God for &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; sins on &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; behalf.  The death we deserved as sinners before a Holy and Righteous God, Jesus took upon Himself and died in our place.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn4" id="ref4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“In Whom we have our redemption through His blood, [which means] the forgiveness of our sins.”
(Colossians 1:14 AMP)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atonement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the term used to sum up the entire saving work of Christ, the offering of a redemptive sacrifice for the sin of man.  Atonement is God's action -- His work, not man's.  Man cannot provide atonement for sin, only God can.  Jesus Christ died the death that every person on the planet deserved and through this act of complete surrender, God's divine justice was satisfied and the wrath of God against sin was appeased.  This satisfaction concerning sin is called &lt;em&gt;propitiation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn5" id="ref5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“He went once for all into the [Holy of] Holies [of heaven], not by virtue of the blood of goats and calves [by which to make reconciliation between God and man], but His own blood, having found and secured a complete redemption (an everlasting release for us). For if [the mere] sprinkling of unholy and defiled persons with blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a burnt heifer is sufficient for the purification of the body, How much more surely shall the blood of Christ, Who by virtue of [His] eternal Spirit [His own preexistent divine personality] has offered Himself as an unblemished sacrifice to God, purify our consciences from dead works and lifeless observances to serve the [ever] living God?”
(Hebrews 9:12–14 AMP)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Justified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; means "to declare or pronounce righteous" (as my pastor likes to say, "just as if I'd never sinned").  Justification is the act of God removing the guilt, condemnation, and the penalty of sin from the believer and placing His own standard of righteousness on them.  This is not something that man can obtain on his own.  It's similar to being acquitted of a crime, but goes much further because as sinners we are guilty -- in other words, we are guilty and deserve the penalty of sin, but God not only doesn't punish us for it, He removes the stain of it from us so completely that it's as if it was never there.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn6" id="ref6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“[And He did it in order] that we might be justified by His grace (by His favor, wholly undeserved), [that we might be acknowledged and counted as conformed to the divine will in purpose, thought, and action], and that we might become heirs of eternal life according to [our] hope.”
(Titus 3:7 AMP)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, in the theological context, means "firm persuasion, belief, conviction, reliance, and complete trust in God alone for salvation".  I like how Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) describes it (one of the twelve definitions it has): "&lt;i&gt;3. In theology, the assent of the mind or understanding to the truth of what God has revealed.  Simple belief of the scriptures, of the being and perfections of God, and of the existence, character and doctrines of Christ, founded on the testimony of the sacred writers, is called historical or speculative faith; a faith little distinguished from the belief of the existence and achievements of Alexander or of Cesar.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn7" id="ref7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“But without faith it is impossible to please and be satisfactory to Him. For whoever would come near to God must [necessarily] believe that God exists and that He is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek Him [out].”
(Hebrews 11:6 AMP)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the undeserved kindness of God or the "unmerited favour" of God.  It is favour that cannot be purchased, gained or earned -- it is 100% the gift of God, and can only be given by God.  This kindness of God came to the world in the form of Jesus Christ who died for us to make us righteous before God.  And as a gift, it can be accepted or rejected.  The Christian accepts this gift of God, the non-Christian rejects it.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn8" id="ref8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“For it is by free grace (God’s unmerited favor) that you are saved (delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ’s salvation) through [your] faith. And this [salvation] is not of yourselves [of your own doing, it came not through your own striving], but it is the gift of God; Not because of works [not the fulfillment of the Law’s demands], lest any man should boast. [It is not the result of what anyone can possibly do, so no one can pride himself in it or take glory to himself.]”
(Ephesians 2:8–9 AMP)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adoption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; means to be placed as a son or daughter into a family, as an actual member of the family with all of the responsibilities and benefits of the family being adopted into.  When God says that we have been adopted as sons, it is not to be a part of the family of God as second-class citizens but as heirs to all of the promises of God.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn9" id="ref9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“To purchase the freedom of (to ransom, to redeem, to atone for) those who were subject to the Law, that we might be adopted and have sonship conferred upon us [and be recognized as God’s sons]. And because you [really] are [His] sons, God has sent the [Holy] Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba (Father)! Father! Therefore, you are no longer a slave (bond servant) but a son; and if a son, then [it follows that you are] an heir by the aid of God, through Christ.”
(Galatians 4:5–7 AMP)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sanctification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; means "to make holy" or "holiness".  This is where we get the word "saint" from ("saint" is &lt;em&gt;hagios&lt;/em&gt; in Greek, meaning "a sanctified one", from the Greek &lt;em&gt;hagiasmos&lt;/em&gt; or "holiness", which is the Greek word translated "sanctification").  Another way to look at this is that to be sanctified, or holy, is when a person lives according to God's design and purpose.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn10" id="ref10"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“to open their eyes, in order to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.’”
(Acts 26:18 NKJV)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, many other terms that could be defined but I think that these are the most important "pillars" of what it means to be a Christian.  The meanings of these words are at the heart of Christian "language" and describe what we believe and show their use and context.  They also illustrate the Christian worldview, to some degree, because they help to provide clarity to how we view the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person has their own worldview -- the lens through which they view the world.  Whether you are Christian, Atheist, Muslim, Hindu, whatever... you have a worldview and there are certain words used to describe that worldview.  In the Christian context, these words are supremely important because they convey certain imagery in a powerful way.  A Christian shouldn’t be tossing these words around without knowing what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when a Christian says "I have been redeemed" or a song's lyrics talk about redemption, we should know what we are saying or singing.  Without a full understanding of the word, it's just words.  As with any words, it's the meaning behind them that give them depth, that give them purpose.  Saying "I have been redeemed" means nothing if you don't know that it paints a picture of our state as slaves to sin, as hopeless captives, without any possibility of rescue in and of ourselves, but that it is only by the price Jesus paid on the cross that we have been taken from the pit of slavery, never to look back.  We have been bought with a price, the blood of Jesus on the cross, so saying "I have been redeemed" should bring to mind the work of Jesus on the cross, the steep price He paid in the suffering, pain, and torture He endured for my sake and for yours.  Knowing the state we were in, and the high price paid, should bring us to deep gratitude and thankfulness, knowing that there is no rescue, no &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;, that we could ever possibly do to purchase our own freedom or place us in right standing before an infinite, holy, and righteous God.  The picture behind the simple statement "I have been redeemed" is rich and potent, yet without the understanding of the word itself, it is minimized to nothing more than a "religious catch-phrase" which robs us of the precious meaning and majesty behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

In a later posting I'll tackle the issue of truth (what it is and why it matters); suffice it to say for now I believe that truth is not subjective as relativism claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin to understand the origin of Christianity, you need to understand the orthodoxy of Christianity (the theories, doctrines, and practices that defined Christianity in the early church and are the pillars of Christian theology today).  These statements or creeds are inviolate -- they are the foundations of Christianity and without them you may have something that &lt;em&gt;resembles&lt;/em&gt; Christianity, but really &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; Christianity.  There are two statements of faith that define Christianity: the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Apostles' Creed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. I believe in God the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
2. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.
3. He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
4. Under Pontius Pilate, He was crucified, died, and was buried.
5. He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again.
6. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
7. He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
8. I believe in the Holy Spirit,
9. the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints,
10. the forgiveness of sins,
11. the resurrection of the body,
12. and the life everlasting.
Amen.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I'm not catholic and this doesn't mean "catholic church" in the sense that we understand it today (not to be confused with the "Catholic Church" as an organized religion today).  It comes from the Greek words &lt;em&gt;kata&lt;/em&gt; (with respect to) and &lt;em&gt;holos&lt;/em&gt; (whole) so the meaning of "catholic" in this statement is the universal (&lt;em&gt;katholikos&lt;/em&gt;) church (or, to put it into our language today, "the holy world-wide united christian church" (again, not to be confused with the "United Church" as an organized religion today)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Nicene Creed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten of his Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by whom all things were made; who for us and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; he suffered and was buried; and the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father; and he shall come again, with glory, to judge both the living and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.

And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets; and we believe in the one holy catholic and apostolic church; we acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins; and we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the Nicene Creed was initially written in 325 AD at the first council of Nicea, and expanded (and slightly re-arranged) at the first council of Constantinople in 381 AD.  This creed was considered the Symbol of Faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these creeds are foundational to Christianity.  To take away or change any of these statements removes the foundational material of the faith and fundamentally changes the faith to something that is like Christianity, but is not, in fact, Christianity.  For instance, Jehovah's Witnesses, despite having a similar Bible and similar beliefs, are not Christian -- they deny the triune nature of God and deny that Jesus is God, both of which are foundational truths to the Christian belief.  Therefore a Jehovah's Witness cannot (and will not) claim to be Christian, because the foundations of the Jehovah's Witness faith are drastically and fundamentally different (not meaning to pick on Jehovah's Witnesses here, but they are probably the closest almost-but-definitely-not-Christian faith I can think of).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to reiterate what I noted above about the "catholic church" because I think it's very important to note, particularly for readers that are not Christian and don't understand the denominational differences that various churches have.  I like the way that Charles Colson and Harold Fickett explain it in their book "The Faith"&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" id="ref1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Church is &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; because all true Christians, while we participate in different confessing congregations, are part of one body.  That body is &lt;i&gt;holy&lt;/i&gt; because its essential nature is found in Christ.  The Church is &lt;i&gt;catholic&lt;/i&gt; because it is universal, which is what &lt;i&gt;catholic&lt;/i&gt; means -- the Church is open to everyone.  Finally, the Church is &lt;i&gt;apostolic&lt;/i&gt;, which means that its teachings are those of the apostles.  We have not invented a religion.  We are part of the faith God revealed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, and perhaps most important to me, these are &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; statements of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

As an aside, my apologies to those who visit and see that I have been sadly lacking in any kind of content on the site.  I will be making a distinct effort to rectify this moving forward, although perhaps not in the way that most might expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since May I have been engaging in theological studies through my church's off-campus theology program (&lt;a href="http://christcity.com/training/CTI"&gt;Christcity Theological Institute&lt;/a&gt; for anyone curious).  The material we have been going through has been exceptional and between a crazy amount of work and my studies I've not had much time for posting random things.  I haven't had time to do extra-curricular mucking around with random computer things like I used to, so there isn't as much to write about as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I've gone through these theological materials (and others), I realize I do have something worth writing about, but it stands apart from the typical content that has been published here for years.  To that end, I opted to keep my thoughts and writings about Christianity and my faith from the front page of the site -- purely to keep the tech focus on the site.  Since I don't feel like maintaining a second blog and don't want to come across as a "Bible thumper" or have anyone feel like I'm attempting to shove my faith down their throat, I've intentionally set these pieces out of "simple sight".  They are perfectly visible in all respects beyond not being on the front page, as I have a feeling these posts may be quite lengthy.  They will be syndicated to my Facebook and Google+ pages, as well as my Twitter feed.  Anyone who haunts those will find that these posts are no real surprise given what I tend to tweet/post (again, rather infrequently as I don't have much time for social media these days either).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please understand that this is by no means an attempt to "hide my faith" as, if that were the aim, I could simply not post these things to begin with.  Also understand that comments have always been moderated on this site, and will continue to be, so that isn't new.  I am more than happy for questions or reasonable comments, but will likely ignore flames or other questionable comments -- I'm not here to pick fights and won't respond to any in kind.  You're free to believe what you like, and you're free to read what you like (and the same holds true for myself).  If you don't like what I write, simply don't read it.  If you're curious or have genuine questions, I will certainly welcome them and try to answer as best I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a journey for understanding.  I have always been a Christian (although not always a very good one!) and I have always had a firmness to my faith, but these studies answer more questions than I had thought to ask (and I will admit that, growing up, this was the adoption of my parents' faith; this is now beyond the shadow of a doubt &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; faith).  However, as I study, Christianity makes sense and in the light of other religions and philosophies in the world, it makes the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; sense.  Future postings will have examples of what I mean by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that I am not a "religious person" and don't believe in following rules for their own sake.  Yes, the orthodoxy of Christianity is religious, in that there is a set of doctrines and beliefs but that is merely the shape of the box.  What is inside the box is vastly different, and is not defined by strict adherence to rules/regulations/laws.  Yes, these things exist and they do so for a purpose, but the fundamental premise and ideology behind the Bible is simple: it's a love story about relationships.  Relationship with God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  Relationships with each other.  I believe that "religion" and the same adherence to rules/regulations/laws are things that have contributed to atrocities committed in the past in the name of God, but were not done in the spirit of what the Bible teaches and so can no more be attributed to God than cars running children over can be attributed to automobile manufacturers, or that murderers can be attributed to law makers.  I will get more into all of this in later posts, however.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for those to whom this may offend: I'm not sorry, it's not on the frontpage, and just don't read it if you don't like it or disagree with it.  Don't feel like you need to post to "convert" me as my aim in posting is not to "convert" you.  To those who want to read, I encourage you to use the RSS feed to be made aware of when new postings are out.  For those concerned these will hit Planet Fedora, don't worry about it.  They won't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I'm convinced that most men don't know what they believe, rather, they only know what they wish to believe. How many people blame God for man's atrocities, but wouldn't dream of imprisoning a mother for her son's crime?” 
? Criss Jami
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my way of knowing not only what I believe, but &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I believe it.  And not just "knowing" but &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt;.  Why would I want to believe in something that is false or that, when you dig past the surface, doesn't make sense?  It concerns me how many people condemn Christianity but know nothing about it, or those who believe in it but have never asked themselves why they do.  Similarly, people shouldn't condemn the Muslim faith without bothering to know anything more than what media presents, while at the same time Muslims should be questioning and looking into their own faith (although this is admittedly difficult due to Sharia Law -- this, in itself, should be causing them to question!).  Even many Darwinists (or Naturalists, or Athiests) never bother to understand the views they implicitly oppose and, if I may be so bold, often don't look logically at their own worldview and philosophy to know what it is they are even professing to believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my way of articulating, both to myself and to others who care to take the same journey, or are already on it, why it is that I believe what I believe and that it isn't some mindless, blind devotion to a dead religion, but a logical and reasonable walk of faith.  I'm not concerned about taking this journey -- after all, if I'm wrong then I want, and need, to know it.  It's not enough for me to be a "good person" or to be a "pew warmer" on a Sunday, get some warm fuzzies and feel good about myself and then be, as James 1:22 says, merely a hearer of the word and not a doer of the word and in the end, simply deceiving myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Christian should be unafraid to take an honest look at the faith, we are in fact instructed to study and learn and understand the Bible and our faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analyzing and accurately dividing [rightly handling and skillfully teaching] the Word of Truth.”
(2 Timothy 2:15 AMP)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.”
(1 Peter 3:15–16 TNIV)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you give an answer for something you do not understand?  As far as I am concerned, these two scriptures indicate that God wants us to know what we believe and why we believe it.  Why?  So that, if we fully understand, we will live our lives according to that understanding -- not simply paying lip-service to a philosophy or good idea, but actually living our lives in such a way that our belief is seen in how we act, not just in what we say.  A &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; belief is something that does not change to suit us.  We change to suit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, as Christians, are called to be agents of change to the world.  How can we possibly change anything if we don't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; believe that what we believe is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; real?*  Just look around and you'll see how poorly we preach the true gospel of Jesus Christ in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

Now that the dust has settled a bit, I just want to link to some sites that I think are good to keep handy as we see this play out.  I don't need to talk about the flaw itself as all you need to do is google "heartbleed" and you'll get all the info you want; certainly more than I can provide here (although you will have to distill the sensational from the facts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="https://zmap.io/heartbleed/"&gt;Heartbleed Bug Health Report&lt;/a&gt;; they're keeping it up to date, but it's essentially a "top 1000 still-vulnerable sites" list
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2014/04/09/heartbleed-bug-websites-affected/"&gt;Mashable's Heartbleed Hit List&lt;/a&gt; which has a list of some of the bigger sites/services that were (or were not) affected and whether they still are; when I looked this morning it was last updated as of last night so presumably they're keeping it fairly up to date
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/heartbleed-bug-apps-affected-list/#!DLTZK"&gt;DigitalTrends Mobile app list&lt;/a&gt; which has a list of vulnerable/not-vulnerable mobile apps
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://heartbleed.com/"&gt;The Heartbleed site&lt;/a&gt; which is being kept up to date with regards to linking to various advisories
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these sites (and the apps that use such sites) have been fixed this week.  There is speculation that this has been known for a while which means the "window of opportunity" may be much bigger than was initially thought.  Some of the numbers being tossed around are pretty gross exaggerations though (one I saw was "66% of the internet vulnerable!") so you have to take things with a grain of salt.  The best advice is to look at the sites you use and if they have fixed the flaw (and were previously vulnerable) and recommend you doing something (like changing your password), strongly consider doing as they suggest -- &lt;b&gt;PROVIDED THEY HAVE ALREADY FIXED THE FLAW&lt;/b&gt;!  Sorry for the caps but I talked to some people yesterday who had rushed to change their password and when I asked them if the site in question was fixed already, they gave me a blank stare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does you NO good to change your password to a site that is STILL vulnerable.  You will only have to change it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, look at the sites noted above, breathe, and keep in mind that changing passwords occasionally is a good thing.  Maybe now is the time to start using something like LastPass, 1Password, KeePass, or something similar and having it generate pure random nonsense for a password, knowing that you can use this tool/service to remember it for you (although, arguably, this whole situation makes me quite happy that I use 1Password (an app on my computer) instead of a service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last point on this is that people need to upgrade if they're using an affected version of OpenSSL.  If you are, and your operating system provides it (which is the case with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, among many others) then you really should be updating to the packages provided.  It's not a question of whether you should or shouldn't -- you should.  Period.  This has been a crazy week and a lot of crazy things have happened and this is a really really bad thing IF you're affected.  So if you are (as in you're running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or a current Fedora, etc.) then you really need to update ASAP.  And then you need to assess your next steps (changing passwords on vulnerable (and now fixed) services, revoking and reissuing certificates if you feel it necessary, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that's all I have to say about Heartbleed.  It will be interesting to see what the next few weeks will be like as we continue to get a bigger picture of what's happened here, how, and to whom.  And to see what damage has been done, and who responded appropriately and when.  For instance, if there were a site or service I was using and as of today (being Saturday, and this thing exploded on Monday) it was still NOT fixed, I don't think I would be using that site/service anymore.  To put it into perspective, Red Hat had updates out late Monday for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 and the other affected products early Tuesday morning (my time).  Everything was available to customers in under 24hrs.  It's not hard to install -- "yum update" and reboot (to make sure everything is covered).  So for a site to be still affected by this now?  There's really no excuse as far as I'm concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, just to note that I did get some minor press coverage (so this is more vanity than useful), &lt;a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/FOSS-Community-Hustles-to-Fix-Gaping-Heartbleed-Flaw-80263.html"&gt;LinuxInsider reported on Heartbleed&lt;/a&gt; and my name is noted, although my answers to the questions must have been less than exciting as there wasn't too much noted there other than where Red Hat customers could go for more info.  =)&lt;/p&gt;

The biggest "rush" of ink has been in the last 5-6 years as I've actually been able to afford it, whereas before it was getting a piece done whenever I could spare a few hundred dollars (which wasn't often) and it also meant the pieces were smaller.  The challenge with the sleeves was that we had merge these things together to make it look a bit cohesive.  I think, considering I have maybe 2-3hrs left to finish the right arm, that we've managed this pretty good.  I want to sincerely thank Jared Phair of &lt;a href="http://crimsonempiretattoo.com/" target="_new"&gt;Crimson Empire&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt; work he has done on both sleeves.  He's done a fantastic job with everything I've thrown at him.  And now I've thrown my wife at him and Angela's tattoo is looking amazing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

In that time, Angela has never gotten a tattoo.  Her sisters and her brother all have, but she was the last of the great holdouts.  I'm pleased to announce that as of January 29th, that is no longer the case!  Angela has lost her tattoo virginity.  And I couldn't be prouder.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, she handled it like a trooper.  She went for 5.5hrs without a break for her first tattoo.  5.5hrs.  I know a lot of guys, with a lot of tattoos themselves, that can't hack that.  Heck, yesterday I was in for 5.5hrs and that last half hour was pretty bad.  She says she could have kept going.  I believe her... I came home like a wuss last night after my 5.5hrs, she came home and was just hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'd like to publicly state that those who mocked and jested and said she couldn't do it (there were quite a few, most predominantly some family whom I am happy to say are properly shamed because she &lt;i&gt;smoked&lt;/i&gt; any of their sessions and in one fell swoop may have surpassed most of them in sheer ink volume) were so completely and utterly wrong that I chuckle whenever I think about it.  I knew she could do it, because my wife is tough -- except when I'm around so as to play me, I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that is much more exciting than what I did yesterday (I also did 5.5hrs, and my second sleeve is almost complete!).  Pictures of both to come shortly.  And pictures of my last session too. &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I can't even say it's &lt;i&gt;begun&lt;/i&gt; to suffer because it's entirely snowballed to the point where my inbox is insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day Lifehacker noted Andreas Klinger's blog posting on &lt;a href="http://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more"&gt;Don't drown in email! How to use Gmail more efficiently.&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a good read and got me thinking.  Unfortunately, I don't use the Gmail web interface and I doubt that it's use of stars and exclamation marks will really work across email clients.  I want something that's easy enough to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been using &lt;a href="http://freron.com/"&gt;MailMate&lt;/a&gt; and it has a nice way of treating Gmail labels like IMAP keywords so that you can tag emails, in MailMate, and have them labelled in Gmail.  The nice thing with this, unlike other non-Gmail normal IMAP providers is that you can tag a message and then delete it, and it will show up in the "folder" corresponding to that label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I created the following labels (in Gmail) and tags (in other IMAP accounts.. yes, I have a few scattered abroad):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; @ACTION: for things that need to be done or responded to
&lt;li&gt; @IMPORTANT: for really important things that need to be done or responded to ASAP (like today)
&lt;li&gt; @WAITING: for things I'm waiting on or expect a reply on, essentially things I'm waiting on a person for (needs to be reviewed weekly)
&lt;li&gt; @FOLLOWUP: for things I need to follow up on (such as things I've delegated, also needs to be reviewed weekly)
&lt;li&gt; @EVENTS: for upcoming events or trips, just so they are easily found
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how @WAITING and @FOLLOWUP will be treated differently.  For now, I'm going to try it this way and see if I use one more than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my goal is to look in the @ACTION folder (on the regular IMAP accounts, I have a smart mailbox in MailMate named after these keywords so that regardless of whether I'm using Gmail or not I get the same behaviour on all email accounts) once a day and deal with quick things, and try to empty out every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The @IMPORTANT stuff will need to be dealt with daily.  That's going to be the hard one.  But I'm going to have to set a time (like 3pm or something) where I have to clear this folder out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest, with the exception of @EVENTS (which should be cleared out after any said events), should be reviewed at the beginning of each week.  Before I used to do reviews on Friday, but that seems odd to me now as I'll be emailing a bunch of folks right before the weekend when they probably don't want to hear from me.  Better to catch them (hopefully!) fresh and chipper on a Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've cleaned out two out of my four emails.  They were the easiest of the two.  Inbox-zero for them both.  My work and primary personal accounts are two different stories, however, and will probably require some time this weekend to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many friends who have, quite literally, thousands of emails in their inbox.  How they manage to stay sane is beyond me.  Maybe if I can get a system that works and I can do consistently (that is my biggest challenge... taking those few seconds to just deal with things) then I can share it with them and they'll maybe realize what a crippling thing it is to have such horrendously large inboxes (and why it feels like their email is so slow.. seriously, I cannot make this make sense to them!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other tips from anyone out there on how to manage your email, or perhaps what clever things you do to manage your email?  Keep in mind that for my work I can quite easily get a few hundred emails in a day, so email is a very important and severely irritating part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="email"></category><category term="gmail"></category><category term="mailmate"></category></entry><entry><title>40 day social media fast</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/40-day-social-media-fast.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-06T18:11:00-07:00</published><updated>2014-01-06T18:11:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2014-01-06:/blog/40-day-social-media-fast.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being sick this Christmas season with a cold and a middle ear infection caused me to spend more time than I normally would have on Twitter and Facebook because it was a complete time-killer and I didn't have energy for anything productive.

In fact, my one goal for this week and a half off of work was to clean my office and as I sit here typing this, I'm taking sad glances around me, to see that my one measly little goal didn't get accomplished.  Which is frustrating and annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect if I had spent less time just wasting time (heck, even sleep would have been more productive), my office would be clean and I'd be feeling good about myself, until at least next week when it would become less-than-tidy again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously blaming social media here is silly, but it did get me to thinking about how much time I spend on these two sites (I have never attempted to measure it), and what I actually get out of the multiple-times-a-day visits.  There's an extremely low "news value" from these sites, and I'm not as interested in what is going on in the lives of friends and family as I perhaps once thought I might be.  In fact, when I really think about it, I realize that they are a complete, utter, and absolute waste of time.  I seriously have better things to do with my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always liked the lyric "wasting time like it was free" (from a Godsmack song) because there is a definite cost to my time.  If I look at what I charge people for my consultancy work, and if I applied that value to the time I spend on something that doesn't actually bring me any pleasure or money (which, I must add, is a very important thing -- if reading Facebook or Twitter was anything more than a "I'm sitting on the toilet and need something quick to read" or "I'm bored so will aimlessly wander around on social media sites", then I would not be making this decision or writing this blog post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, I find more value on Google+ because it's all tech-related things that show up the odd time I go on there.  I am going to put Google+ into the fast however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to fast from Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.  I've already removed the apps from my phone (which is the only time I really look at them).  And I think I'm going to close my Linkedin account because I get absolutely &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt; value from that and all the Linkedin endorsements and buddy requests and so on just annoy me.  I mean, as an example, there is a wonderful woman who's daughter we took in for a few months as a friend/buddy/whatever on Linkedin and we know each other, but she doesn't really know the work that I do (other than it's computer-related).  So for her to endorse me for my Ruby programming skills is a bit odd -- for one, I can say with 98% certainty that she has no idea what Ruby is other than it must be a geek thing, I'm a geek-ish person, so I must have the skill, right?  Secondly, I don't have any Ruby skills so... yeah.. don't endorse me for Ruby.  Now I doubt she thought one day that she would endorse me for a bunch of random crap, but Linkedin did helpfully suggest that maybe she'd like to endorse me for random crap?  And so she did... probably because she was bored or thought it had some value for me (it doesn't).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook and Twitter just irritate me, Linkedin actually cheeses me right off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I'm going to fast from these social media sites for 40 days.  After that, we'll see.  Maybe I'll find I didn't miss them at all and shut them down permanently.  Maybe I'll be desperate to know what's been going on the last 40 days and will binge and spend a whole hour or so feasting my eyes with nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I miss hearing about friends who love their kids one day and hate them the next?  Will I miss hearing about the seemingly constant misadventures of family when it comes to dating?  Or dieting?  Will I miss people who whine and complain about their crap lives?  When Facebook was new and a novelty, I thought that sort of thing was amusing.  Now I just find it sort of sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postings from my blog will still get auto-posted to Facebook and Twitter.  But if you intend to comment on them, you may want to do so here and not via either social media site as I won't see the response.  Also, there's a few RSS feeds on my Facebook, but I have no idea how to configure the app to disable them, and it's just my blog and opensource.com (highly recommended!) anyways, so I'll leave those intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So February 15th is the day I either return to social media or ... don't.  Right now, I'm betting on the latter.  All social expression will be made here on my blog.  Or Flickr.  I intend to spend some time getting some photos I've been meaning to get up there so as to share (some great pics of our trip to Jasper and the Columbian Ice Fields last summer are my top priority).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="facebook"></category><category term="twitter"></category></entry><entry><title>MailMate keyboard shortcuts and Gmail archive handling</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/mailmate-keyboard-shortcuts-and-gmail-archive-handling.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-28T16:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-12-28T16:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2013-12-28:/blog/mailmate-keyboard-shortcuts-and-gmail-archive-handling.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, playing around with MailMate I've found you can create keyboard shortcuts.

It comes with a standard keyboard shortcut list, one for Postbox (a Thunderbird-based email client), and Gmail.  My main need here to is to map "delete" to "Archive message" because MailMate, unlike Apple's Mail, does not seem to have a setting to turn "delete" into "archive".  So when I hit the delete key, my message goes to the trash, rather than just removing the label of the current mailbox (so if it's in the Inbox, remove the "Inbox" label, which removes it from the mailbox but keeps it in Gmail's "All Mail").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing's first, we need to create our new keybinding list.  To do this, copy the Standard.plist from &lt;b&gt;/Applications/MailMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings&lt;/b&gt; (to reveal this in the Finder, right-click the MailMate application icon and select "Show Package Contents".  This is where you'll find the three keybinding plist files: Gmail, Postbox, and Standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the directory to store the new keybinding file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/MailMate
% mkdir -p Resources/KeyBindings
% cp /Applications/MailMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings/Standard.plist Resources/KeyBindings/Mutt.plist
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a new plist file called Mutt.plist.  You can edit this file with any text editor.  I suggest copying one of the existing plist files as it will have some of the commands you may already want in there with the funky characters like the down arrow, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important one (to me) is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
"\UF728" = "deleteMessage:";
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want that backspace key to delete the message.   You can use the "archive" command here, which will remove it from the mailbox (and remove its label) but this also puts it into a new "[Gmail]/Archive" folder.  This folder doesn't exist normally.  So while it does accomplish what I want (remove it from the specified mailbox without actually permanently deleting the message), it does it in a wonky way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, this leads to more Gmail-related things.  Writing blog posts while working through issues is so much fun.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that I imported these from Apple Mail rather than creating them as new accounts.  In the &lt;a href="http://updates.mailmate-app.com/release_notes"&gt;1.7.1 release notes&lt;/a&gt; we see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New: Changed default behavior for new Gmail accounts. 1. “[Gmail]/All Mail” is subscribed. 2. Default archive mailbox is “[Gmail]/All Mail”. Existing accounts are not affected."
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting.  So when I go to edit the IMAP account, I see that these are not subscribed.  So this gets us more like Apple Mail where it also note too downloads the All Mail folder (some people have an issue with this... I never have, I kinda like that it's all downloaded).  So I had "All Mail", "Important", and "Starred" unsubscribed.  The "Important" one can remain unsubscribed as that's what Gmail thinks is important, not me.  All Mail is subscribed to, and so is Starred.  MailMate has nice smart mailboxes so you don't need to have the Starred one (it has a default smart mailboxes called "Flagged" which shows you flagged messages in each mailbox.. unfortunately, with three email accounts handled by MailMate, having three "INBOX" smart folders means I can't zero in on one specific account; the Starred mailbox will let me do that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I noticed in the 1.7.1 release notes is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; New: Changed default behavior for new Gmail accounts. 1. “[Gmail]/All Mail” is subscribed. 2. Default archive mailbox is “[Gmail]/All Mail”. Existing accounts are not affected.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing is that it seems when you subscribe to "[Gmail]/All Mail", the default archive mailbox is changed as well (so if you archive messages, it goes to All Mail rather than Archive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we can get back to your keyboard shortcuts.  As noted above, we can now change the "deleteMessage" command to "archive" and have it do what we want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
"\UF728" = "archive:";
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, because it is useful to be able to permanently delete stuff, we can have something like "^d" or some such to permanently delete:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
"^d" = "deleteMessage:";
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, calling this "Mutt" keybindings is a bit of a misnomer because they're not default mutt keybindings (although some of them are for &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; mutt setup), but here's my Mutt.plist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    "\UF728" = "archive:";               // ?  (forward-delete)
    "\U007F" = "archive:";               // delete
    "^d"     = "deleteMessage:";         // CTRL-D
    " "      = "scrollPageDown:";        // Space (alternatively it can be bound to scrollPageDownOrNextUnreadMessage:)
    "$ "     = "scrollPageUp:";          // Shift-space
    "\U000A" = "openMessages:";          // Return
    "\U000D" = "openMessages:";          // Enter

    "m"      = "newMessage:";
    "r"      = "replySender:";
    "G"      = "replyAll:";             // group reply
    "R"      = "replyList:";            // list reply
    "f"      = "forwardMessage:";
    "F"      = "toggleFlag:";           // flag-message
    "/"      = "mailboxSearch:";
    "^/"     = "searchAllMessages:";
    "~e"     = "expandThread:";         // OPT-E
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just my "starting" list.  I'll be tweaking it as I get used to MailMate more.  So far, so good...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information is found in the MailMate &lt;a href="http://manual.mailmate-app.com/custom_key_bindings"&gt;Custom key bindings&lt;/a&gt; section of the online manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT&lt;/b&gt;: I removed the bits about the custom keybindings not overriding the Standard.plist keybindings as, poking around further, I realized that you need to restart MailMate in order for it to pickup the new keybindings and that was why it did not appear to be working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="gmail"></category><category term="mailmate"></category><category term="email"></category></entry><entry><title>Mavericks Mail is Apple's worst Mail yet</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/mavericks-mail-is-apples-worst-mail-yet.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-28T15:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-12-28T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2013-12-28:/blog/mavericks-mail-is-apples-worst-mail-yet.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;To begin with, I &lt;i&gt;liked&lt;/i&gt; Apple Mail in Mountain Lion (and Lion also).  I've been using Apple Mail for a while now for my personal email on my mac, and mutt for my work email on my Fedora box.

I've been using Apple Mail for a while now for my personal email on my mac, and mutt for my work email on my Fedora box.  It works well, and I've gotten used to using a GUI for my personal email and like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then Mavericks came out and everything changed.  Seriously...  how do you release a complete and utter CRAP email client in 10.9.0, have an update to fix Gmail, then have more Gmail-related fixes in 10.9.1 and it &lt;i&gt;STILL&lt;/i&gt; is complete and utter crap?  Mountain Lion's Mail worked just peachy with Gmail.  This?  This ... does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anyone yacks about Gmail itself... been using Google Apps for years, love it, not changing.  Period.  I'd rather change email clients.  Which, in fact, looking at my mail this morning (after having been replying/deleting/etc mail on my phone the last two days), I see all the messages I've delete still showing as new on my computer, despite having been deleted days ago.  Seriously?  Even telling it to sync/refresh/get new mail doesn't make those deleted messages (that are most definitely &lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt; on the web UI) disappear.  The fix?  Restarting Mail.  Sorry... that doesn't cut it.  I'm not restarting my desktop mail client everytime I manipulate a mailbox on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been playing this morning with &lt;a href="http://freron.com/"&gt;MailMate&lt;/a&gt; which looks intriguing.  So far I'm liking it.  A few things I want to note so that I don't forget when setting it up on the other system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some font settings can be changed in the preferences.  The mail headers text cannot, but a quick trip to the Terminal fixes it and makes it easier for me to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% defaults write com.freron.MailMate MmHeadersViewFontName -string "Verdana"     
% defaults write com.freron.MailMate MmHeadersViewFontSize -float 14
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one changes the "on [date] so and so wrote:" string to "On 12/23/2013, at 9:59 AM, So and So wrote:" (slightly different from the default)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% defaults write com.freron.MailMate MmReplyWroteString -string 'On %m/%d/%Y, at %k:%M %p, ${from.name:${from.address}} wrote:'
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the other settings are largely set in the Preferences.  Some esoteric things are not configurable in the Preferences, so checking the Help for "Hidden Preferences" and "Low-Level Customization" will let you tweak things even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside that I've found so far is that it does not support Kerberos authentication (GSSAPI) and I can't find a way to have threads expanded by default.  The lack of GSSAPI isn't a deal-breaker (although it sure would be nice), but the thread expansion issue is pretty annoying.  The only thing I found is that holding OPTION while clicking the thread triangle or the right arrow key will expand the thread (OPTION+LEFT-ARROW to collapse the thread, but it's a bit wonky and not great as you need to be on the first message in the thread to expand/collapse the entire thread).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging into it, it looks fairly powerful.  It's a bit steeply priced for a mail client ($50USD) but since I'm in my email all the time... maybe it's worth it?  Will need to keep digging/playing during this trial period to see if it's worth the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could always wait to see if Apple fixes their sh*t, but at this point I'm so annoyed that maybe this has pushed me to find something better.  Not quite how I wanted to spend my holidays but... meh.  I don't get the opportunity to poke around with new things too often, so this is a bit of a refresher.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="gmail"></category><category term="mailmate"></category><category term="email"></category></entry><entry><title>Merry Christmas!</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/merry-christmas.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-24T15:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-12-24T15:48:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2013-12-24:/blog/merry-christmas.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas to all my friends, family, co-workers, partners-in-crime, and just generally everyone else out there.

&lt;p&gt;Some code that I'm working on has a development branch which I'm working on while other fixes are being made to the master branch.  This is great, except for the fact that I need to apply any changes made to master to the development branch as well (we'll call it "feat/X").  And since I'm the only one working on feat/X, but others add fixes or necessary changes to master, I need to apply those changes.  Some changes will apply clean, others need to be modified due to one part that is receiving a major overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is probably a better way to do this and if so, please do let me know in the comments.  Even though I use git almost daily, I am by no means a power user and would love more "insider tips".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have my working copy, and I need it to know about both branches.  By default, if you clone the repository you'll just be on the master branch.  So in this case I would have to &lt;code&gt;git checkout feat/X&lt;/code&gt;.  Once I do that, I will see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% git branch
* feat/X
  master
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do a &lt;code&gt;git checkout master&lt;/code&gt; to switch back to the master branch.  From here we can make a series of patches that represent code changes made to master after feat/X was branched:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% git format-patch feat/X
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time you do this, all the patches will be new.  But as you move along, you'll continue to see these patches show up so it's useful to keep them kicking around so you know which are new.  You'll see patches in the format "0001-The-commit-text.patch" and "0002-Other-commit-text.patch".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I move the patches out of the way (I have horrid file management, so I just &lt;code&gt;mv *patch ~/&lt;/code&gt;).  Then &lt;code&gt;git checkout feat/X&lt;/code&gt; to switch to the feat/X branch.  Now we apply the patches one-by-one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% git am &lt;0001-The-commit-text.patch
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the patch is successful, you can do the same to the next.  If not, however, you need to fiddle with things a bit.  You'll see an error like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% git am &lt;~/0001-The-commit-text.patch
Applying: The commit text
error: patch failed: something/else.py:559
error: something/else.py: patch does not apply
Patch failed at 0001 The commit text
The copy of the patch that failed is found in:
   /home/vdanen/my-git-repo/.git/rebase-apply/patch
When you have resolved this problem, run "git am --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git am --skip" instead.
To restore the original branch and stop patching, run "git am --abort".
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run &lt;code&gt;git am --abort&lt;/code&gt; which will revert the commit attempt, to allow you to manually apply the patch and commit.  You can also use &lt;code&gt;git am --skip&lt;/code&gt; to do the same.  I suspect if you fed git something like &lt;code&gt;git am &amp;lt;~/*patch&lt;/code&gt; these commands would mean different things (abort the session versus skip the one patch) but if you're doing one patch at a time they both do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check the log output with &lt;code&gt;git log master..HEAD --stat&lt;/code&gt; which will show that our branch contains the update, along with the appropriate author information (might be you, might be me, might be someone else).  I tend to skip the log bit and just apply one patch at a time.  Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you don't move your patches like I did, you can use &lt;code&gt;git clean&lt;/code&gt; to remove the patches from your working directory.  Use '-n' first though, so it runs in dry-run mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I indicated earlier, there are probably simpler ways to do this, but this works for me.  I got all of this from &lt;a href="http://rypress.com/tutorials/git/patch-workflows.html"&gt;Ry's Git Tutorial on Patch Workflows&lt;/a&gt;.  Excellent tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="git"></category></entry><entry><title>Adventures in AppleRAID</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/adventures-in-appleraid.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-07T21:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-12-07T21:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2013-12-07:/blog/adventures-in-appleraid.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Actually, it's not much of an adventure so much as a reminder.

I'm used to doing software RAID on Linux with mdadm and am fully comfortable with the commandline tools -- in fact, I prefer them to any GUI tools that may or may not be out there (for example, if I were to have a choice of using mdadm on the commandline versus using Anaconda to setup a RAID array, I would take the commandline).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I use Apple's software RAID on OS X as well.  With mdadm I'm fully confident.  With Apple RAID I'm not as much, primarily because I've not had the opportunity to put it through it's paces, and also because Disk Utility is absolutely horrendous for dealing with setting the RAID arrays up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I was unlucky enough in mid-2012 to buy a few of those Seagate drives that chirped.  Harmless, once I realized the drives were not going to die, but annoying nonetheless.  Suffice it to say, I've gotten used to it.  Anyways, 3TB drives are $130CAD a piece now which is pretty cheap, and these drives have been running for the last year and a half pretty much non-stop.  Between price, requiring some larger drives as offline archives (to which use I can put these chirpy drives), and really feeling like I should test the Apple RAID (last test I believe was in 10.7 and now the system is running 10.9), I figured it was a good time to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple procedure: shut down the computer, pull out one drive, pop in a new drive, fire it back up.  Because I have a RAID0+1 (so three RAID arrays, two RAID mirrors and one RAID stripe), I could pull two drives, one from each mirror array, and rebuild two at a time but I prefer to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon bootup I get the "you've inserted an uninitialized disk" notice (to which I tell it to ignore the drive), get a happy degraded RAID warning from SMARTReporter, and am ready to get it back up and running.  The required commands are surprisingly simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% &lt;b&gt;sudo diskutil list&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, we've removed the first physical drive in the Mac Pro's four bays (I have an SSD as a boot device in there as disk0), so it's disk1 we're interested in.  Make a note of the disk identifier (the one with no partitions on it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we want to see what our RAID information looks like because we need to know which array this drive needs to be added to, and we need to know the unique identifer (UUID) of the RAID array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a few bits of info here.  The first is the uuid of our RAID mirror that it's in a degraded state (the RAID volume name is Stuff_2, above, with the uuid noted below the name).  The second bit of information we need is the uuid of the &lt;i&gt;failed&lt;/i&gt; drive (in this case, the drive I removed).  We will need to remove this missing device from the array after we add the new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;b&gt;sudo diskutil appleraid add member disk# [uuid-of-raid]&lt;/b&gt;
As you can see from the above, we added the new drive (disk1) to the RAID array named Stuff_2.  And after we did so, performed another list operation, and you can see three drives associated with that array -- one is online, one is missing, and one is rebuilding.  Now we need to remove the missing one as we won't be adding it back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% &lt;b&gt;sudo diskutil appleraid remove F3921C5D-0B94-4264-9619-0291A5147F4E C96F3052-8EBD-45D5-9A25-29EE23957CA9&lt;/b&gt;
Started RAID operation
Removing disk from RAID
Finished RAID operation
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;b&gt;sudo diskutil appleraid remove [uuid-of-failed-drive] [uuid-of-raid]&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it.  Honestly, it took me longer to type this out than it did to rebuild the RAID array.  Sadly, in that time it's only progressed to 3% rebuilt.  The downside of such large drives is the reconstruction time is a little ridiculous.  Anyways, once you've run these commands in Terminal, if you were to fire up Disk Utility, you'd see a nice little GUI progress bar that, for me, indicates it will take 4hrs to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, for anyone who has fought with Disk Utility to manage anything RAID in OS X, you'll appreciate how simple the diskutil commandline tool makes things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="raid"></category></entry><entry><title>Git commits on xkcd</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/git-commits-on-xkcd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-11-27T14:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-11-27T14:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2013-11-27:/blog/git-commits-on-xkcd.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_commit.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the pics don't really do it justice as it's a hard thing to take pictures of, but Ang tried.  =)  Pictures of Jesus' hands holding a thawing heart are now on Flickr.  This is probably my favourite but boy did it feel... interesting.  I wondered why I had never felt a certain kind of pain before and after I looked at it I realized he had gone about an inch higher towards the armpit on the inner arm.  That definitely explains it!  Lots of crazy detail in this one, and some really cool shapes with bright yellow/orange/red colors that also use a lot of negative space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This smart, savvy executive had no idea how to effectively use a tool through which major business decisions were being made. He had no email pending or reference folders set up, and he had stored every saved email in his inbox. As a result, he had more than 87,000 emails, spanning over 14 years, sitting as an amorphous pile of stress in his inbox.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amorphous pile of stress indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a few other mailboxes (mostly mailing lists) that I need to apply the "Inbox Zero" principle to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also know plenty of people that could seriously learn about filters and deleting email.  I've got friends that have as many emails in their inbox as this guy does (the idea is to keep everything in the inbox and use no other folders... I suppose they think it's clever and makes it easy to find stuff, I call it insanity).  Actually, oddly enough, most of the people I know outside of work do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been programming in Python for a few years now (I can pretty much mark the beginning because of starting at Red Hat).  Since picking it up, I've fallen in love with the language and have a few books on the subject.  One of the most indispensable books I have is Learning Python 3rd Edition published by O'Reilly.  Recently I received a copy of the 5th Edition for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction was that it was no mere book, but a tome.  The 3rd Edition was no slouch, weighing in at 700 pages, but the 5th Edition is a hefty 1540 pages, over twice the size!  This edition was released in June 2013 (ISBN 978-1-449-35573-9); the previous edition that I owned (the 3rd) was published in October 2007.  This new edition was updated to cover Python versions 3.3 and 2.7 (the 4th Edition covered 2.6 and 3.0/3.1, so I imagine it too had a hefty size increase over the 3rd Edition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go further with the review I have to note that Learning Python 3rd Edition is nearly always on my desk.  I referenced that book all the time.  With the number of alternatives out there (searching on the internet or looking at other books that I have, such as Programming Python, the Python Cookbook, and Python in a Nutshell), this is the one book I used all the time.  It is worn, crinkled, dirty, and probably sticky in a few spots as well.  However, I'm not one to read books like this from front to back -- I use them as reference material for areas that interest me or I need help with (or I need to brush up on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first section of the book, "Getting Started" goes into the basics of Python: what it is, what it's used for, how to use it, why you would use it, and so forth.  The 5th Edition expands on this, particular in regards to version 3.3 and its new options in Windows.  This is all the really basic stuff, explained quite well and great for those interested in getting into Python without a lot of knowledge of the language.  Those more experienced with Python will likely skip this section for the most part, but there are some good bits in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second section of the book, "Types and Operations", gets to the meat of writing code.  This is the section that talks about Python object types (lists, dictionaries, tuples), how Python handles numbers, dynamic typing, manipulating and using strings, and handling file operations.  One thing I noticed immediately is that the section dealing with numbers is greatly expanded from the 3rd Edition and this is largely due to the changes of how these are handled in Python 2.x vs 3.x.  It is in this chapter that you begin to see why the book is so hefty -- instead of focusing on just one major version of the language, it provides the necessary information for both 2.x and 3.x and the differences between the two.  Because Python 2.x is still so widely used, it would have been impossible to ignore it unless they decided to write two books, one for each major version.  The section on handling strings has likewise been expanded, enhanced, and re-organized with quite a bit of extra content.  Again, quite a bit of this is due to the coverage of both Python 2.x and 3.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third section of the book, "Statements and Syntax", gets into the fundamentals of handling your code: typical statements (if/elif/else, variable assignments, loop handling, creating functions, namespaces, module handling, and exception handling).  Here again a lot of content is devoted to the differences between 2.x and 3.x, and even between different versions of 2.x.  There is a lot of content here -- chapters devoted to topics about looping, if statements, iteration and comprehension, the 2.x print statement versus the 3.x print function, and even how to generate documentation for your code using PyDoc.  For those learning Python, and even for those who choose to use this book as a reference, this section will be greatly used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most significantly changed sections between the two editions of Learning Python (again, noting that I've never looked at the 4th Edition so I don't know how significant a change it is between the 4th and 5th editions), is what was "Functions" in the 3rd edition is now "Functions and Generators" in the 5th Edition.  There is a significant overhaul between the two: where before "Scopes and Arguments" were a single chapter, we now have two chapters, one devoted to each topic; the 33 page chapter has turned into 67 pages spanning two chapters.  It also goes into great detail about generator functions and expressions (something I have yet to fully explore).  Suffice it to say, there is a good 45 pages of new content here that will prove interesting to read (list comprehension, generators, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth section, "Modules and Packages" likewise contains greatly expanded content covering the use of modules, how to create them, why (and how) you should use them, the differences between importing and reloading modules, full coverage of Python 3.3 namespace packages, problems you can encounter with module use, and so forth.  It talks about the features common to both major versions of Python, and has sections that are more specific, such as how byte code is handled (.pyc in versions prior to 3.2 and the &lt;strong&gt;pycache&lt;/strong&gt; directory in 3.2+) and namespace packages that were introduced in 3.3 (which is also shows the differences between regular packages and namespace packages).  This once again shows the level of detail the book provides for users of any version of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section six is all about Object-Oriented Programming and classes, and gives great detail and examples on topics such as polymorphism, classes and subclasses, object handling, operator overloading, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section seven goes into the how's and why's of exceptions and how to use them to write good error-handling in your code.  This is the last section that appears in both editions, although (as with every other section), this one is greatly expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new section in the 5th Edition, compared to the 3rd, is the "Advanced Topics" section and its five chapters.  This section goes into unicode and byte strings -- an area that has seen a lot of changes between Python 2.x and 3.x, as well as managed attributes, decorators for functions and classes, metaclasses and the differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I've not yet read the entire book and chances are I never will.  Most of these programming books I never do read end-to-end, but I do use them as functional references and to learn new things from (pretty much the entire "Advanced Topics" section is new to me), as well as to brush up on older things.  From the parts I've read, and the comparisons I've made to the 3rd edition, this is most definitely a worthwhile "upgrade".  One thing I appreciate as well is the consistent back-and-forth regarding Python 2.x versus 3.x.  As a Python coder who has never yet touched Python 3.x, this book will help me understand the subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, nuances between both major versions -- when the time comes (aka: when the time is available).  As such, this book is valuable to me now (writing code in Python 2.x) and will be valuable to me in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly appreciate the expanded content, as it's already twigged a few things in my mind about the code I've written so far, and has given me some new ideas on how to handle certain issues or improve performance/handling of my code.  This is both good and dangerous!  Having said that, this is most definitely a book worth getting for any Python programmer who either is new to the language or is a veteran of the language -- the first will appreciate the no-nonsense easy-to-understand approach to introducing both the basics and some quite advanced topics, while the latter will appreciate it as a reference book or to expand on their understanding of certain topics.  For myself, I'm somewhere in the middle of the two and this book is introducing me to a lot of stuff I do not yet know, and is a very handy reference for the stuff that I do know (and need reminders of every once in a while).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've highly recommended the 3rd edition of this book to anyone asking about good books on Python, and the 5th Edition is no different.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants more than just a passing understanding of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a replacement for my well-worn and well-loved 3rd Edition, I know this book will see much use from me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Real-world SSD vs HDD: cvs2svn speed</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/real-world-ssd-vs-hdd-cvs2svn-speed.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-20T09:03:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-08-20T09:03:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2013-08-20:/blog/real-world-ssd-vs-hdd-cvs2svn-speed.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This just absolutely blew my mind so I figured I'd post a quick note about it.

I have to convert a CVS repository to SVN and this is a big repository, over 33k commits to it spanning a decade.  In my trial runs, using cvs2svn resulted in it taking just shy of 11.5hrs to complete, on the HDD (I have an SSD in my workstation for everything and a 2TB HDD for storage and scratch space which is where I was running the conversion).  Moving the original raw CVS repository into a temporary directory on the SSD and running cvs2svn from there (reading from and writing to the SSD) resulted in 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come again?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right... 19 &lt;i&gt;minutes&lt;/i&gt;.  Moving from the HDD to an SSD dropped the conversion from 11.5hrs to 19 &lt;i&gt;minutes&lt;/i&gt;.  I expected a speed-up, but I did not expect it to be this drastic.  It makes me wonder how much faster having my Fedora mirror on an SSD would be when doing rq imports.  There I have the MySQL database on the SSD, but all the rpms are being read/unpacked on the large HDD.  Importing can be slow, given the size of Fedora (queries to the database is really fast).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my Fedora/CentOS mirror is almost 800GB and that would be a very expensive purchase.  This makes me sad.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="ssd"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting up a Drobo 5N</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/setting-up-a-drobo-5n.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-26T22:12:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-06-26T22:12:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2013-06-26:/blog/setting-up-a-drobo-5n.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's something about NAS units that makes me happy.

Tiny little boxes full of storage and ripe for mucking with since for the most part they run Linux make me all warm and fuzzy and just generally put me in a good mood.  Probably because I'm a bit of a digital packrat, so I like having gobs of storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've played with different NAS units over the years: the D-Link DNS-323 was a favourite for a while due to it's high hackability, and I've used the Iomega Storcenter ix2-200 (it's not awful, but not great).  I did some consulting for a friend's company earlier this year and setup a QNAP for them for off-site backups, and when the backup box at my mom's died I picked up a QNAP for myself (I like these QNAPs; very familiar md-based RAID and really quite feature-rich, easier to muck about it in than the DNS-323 I found).  The same friend also had two Drobo units at his office, connected via FW800 to a Mac Mini (so two big storage volumes).  When I first popped in, one of the units had a failed drive that needed replacing, and within the following 2-3mos, another drive in each unit had died.  Zero-dataloss in both cases, which impressed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking the backup box from my mom's that I replaced with the QNAP, I played a bit with FreeNAS (I've never played with ZFS before so it seemed like a good excuse).  I like FreeNAS -- those guys did some excellent work on it, but after doing a bunch of reading I'm glad I went with the QNAP at my mom's rather than building a new FreeNAS-based box to put there.  And it didn't seem like the right fit for what I wanted at home (lots of storage with a small footprint, low power usage, and not necessarily having all the bells and whistles that I didn't need).  As a result, I did some reading up on the Drobo 5N which sounded like a perfect fit, and having had played with those other two Drobo units, seemed like it could be exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drobo 5N is a NAS unit (so only takes power and ethernet as far as "peripherals" go.  It's a Linux-based system as well, which meant I could poke around and make it do interesting things.  I also like that it can take an mSATA SSD for a caching accelerator, making writing to the device much faster.  I also really like that I can hot-swap the drives easily.  No downtime, no dataloss, what's not to like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I picked one up and loaded it with five drives and a 128GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll dispense with the typical "unboxing" that you tend to find, and get right down to making it more usable.  Out of the box, the Drobo does SMB/CIFS and AFP, so it works good for OS X and Windows.  NFS is available through the &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/a/droboports.com/www/"&gt;DroboPorts&lt;/a&gt; site, but after fiddling with it for a bit (and it might just be a quirk of this version or I did something wrong), I wasn't able to write to the shares (only read), so I instead went with using CIFS to mount this thing from Linux instead.  When a new version of NFS is available for it maybe I'll try it again.  For now, CIFS works pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first steps to make this thing a bit more usable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/a/droboports.com/www/app-repository/openssh-6-1"&gt;openssh&lt;/a&gt;.  This will allow you to log remotely into the Drobo unit.  A few things to note: 1) you will need to copy the openssh.tgz to the DroboApps share and then reboot, at which point openssh will get installed and will start, 2) any users defined will by default have access via ssh to the Drobo, 3) root has access with the default password "root" (please please please change this ASAP!), 4) the defined administrator user's username is Admin, not admin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have openssh installed and can ssh into the box, you can install &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/a/droboports.com/www/app-repository/sudo-1-8-5p3"&gt;sudo&lt;/a&gt;.  You'll need to install it as root (or as Admin, and then login as root and chown everything to root).  The app instructions indicate to setup a sudo group, etc. but unless you have more than one user it's probably unnecessary.  You can simply edit the sudoers file to give your Admin user sudo access, or a chosen other user (say, joe or mary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two I find pretty much critical to install, but some other essential apps to add would be rsync, vim, curl, and nfs (assuming you can make the latter work better than I could).  Other nice apps that are available include git and openvpn.  You can even install apache and mysql on this thing if you were so inclined (as well as php, python, ruby, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because none of these will be in your $PATH, you'll need to follow these &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/a/droboports.com/www/using-command-line-apps"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to get these things in your $PATH if you want to use them easily when you ssh in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've done all of this, the final steps would be to 1) change the root password if you have not already done so, 2) copy an ssh public key to the drobo and make sure it works for password-less authentication, 3) turn off password-based authentication to the Drobo via editing /mnt/DroboFS/Shares/DroboApps/openssh/etc/sshd_config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I'm pleased with this unit.  I loaded it with 2x4TB, 2x3TB, and 1x1.5TB (the latter simply because I pulled it from a de-commissioned box and didn't want to waste the drive), and it gave me 10TB of usable space, which is pretty good.  In this configuration it will tolerate one dead drive.  The data on here isn't critical enough for me to enable the dual-drive-fail mode (which would drop the usable space to just upwards of 6TB; I care more about the space than the redundancy for what's going to be stored on it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the various consumer NAS boxes I've used, the Drobo is by far the most simplistic. But what it does, it does extremely well.  The QNAP is my second choice.  But since my Linux boxen take care of all the other extras that these things provide, the Drobo 5N and its more simplistic interface/feature-set really met my needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="drobo"></category></entry><entry><title>Of bugzilla, python, fetchmail, and procmail</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/of-bugzilla-python-fetchmail-and-procmail.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-08T14:31:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-06-08T14:31:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2013-06-08:/blog/of-bugzilla-python-fetchmail-and-procmail.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been working with bugzilla for years.. at Mandriva I was the primary bugzilla care-taker for a few years, and now with Red Hat I do a lot of work on some internal tools that interface with bugzilla that enhances and directs the workflow of day-to-day work (being that we …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been working with bugzilla for years.. at Mandriva I was the primary bugzilla care-taker for a few years, and now with Red Hat I do a lot of work on some internal tools that interface with bugzilla that enhances and directs the workflow of day-to-day work (being that we work with bugzilla all the time).  I also run my own bugzilla instance a) so I can keep up to date with the goings-on of bugzilla and b) so I can track various things in some of the scripts I write and other stuff.  One thing that I do is also use it as a way of logging issues that may come up with the various bits of web hosting that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I needed was a way to take incoming emails generated by lfd (my primary concern right now is high load average warnings; I wanted to log them to bugzilla so that if I'm unavailable my dad could also see them (he helps maintain the server and hosts a bunch of his stuff there as well) and perhaps deal with them or at the very least if he wanted/needed to comment on them he could do so via bugzilla, and I can also make note of resolutions or causes, etc.  Yes, I'm turning bugzilla into a poor man's "RT" ticketing system (I have no interest in setting something like that up, I'm already using bugzilla, and this is the best place for me to stuff these sorts of notes).  I've tried the email_in.pl method and while it works, it only works if you have a specific format so you can assign it to the right component and product -- not something that will work with these lfd-generated emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that a lot of the work that I've been doing has to do with using python and xmlrpc to manipulate bugs in the Red Hat bugzilla, it seemed like a reasonable approach to take to deal with my own bug mangling.  The problem is that these emails were being sent to root, which in turn forwards directly to me.  I also wanted to keep a copy of those mails in my own mailbox in case bugzilla, or anything in between, did something funky, so I opted to do a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; use a gmail filter to forward those emails to another email account specifically for bugzilla mails
&lt;li&gt; setup fetchmail to pull (via pop3) those emails
&lt;li&gt; setup procmail to filter those emails and send them to a helper script
&lt;li&gt; write a helper script that will then call the &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/python-bugzilla"&gt;python-bugzilla&lt;/a&gt; tool to file the bug
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step was easy.  Fetchmail was pretty easy too (although it's been a few years).  Procmail was easy, particularly now since I'm only concerned with one particular type of email and my gmail filter is quite specific.  The helper script was initially a shell script that was going to call the bugzilla script but I quickly found limitations to that, particular since lfd's email also has a few attachments and I was having issues with getting it to file the bugs properly.  So instead of using uudeview and a shell script, I opted to write something in python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of procmail feeding uudeview and then feeding my script, I made use of some of the features of python that allow for manipulating email messages (something I've never done before).  I also found that passing stdin to the python script was somehow also passing stdin to python-bugzilla when I was calling it, which was causing all kinds of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this script I learned all kinds of new things: how to manipulate an email message in python and reduce an email with attachments to a message body with individual attachments as objects and how to use subprocess (yes, I'm still using the commands stuff by and large, but that was really problematic with stdin being persistent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all it works quite well.  However, I do still have one problem that I've not yet liked, and that is with binary files.  I'm not sure where the issue is coming from, but for some reason when I call python-bugzilla myself, in a shell, and feed it the file to attach to the bug it works fine -- however, when I call it from my script (so no shell), it uses the --file argument as the name of the file and wants stdin as the contents of the file.  This is all fine and dandy, but somewhere along the line something is rendering that binary file (was testing with a jpeg) into text and when it's attached to the bug it has the right mime type, but the contents are wrong and no image is displayed.  So, dear lazy web, if there any python folks out there who want to look at my script and tell me what I'm doing wrong, I'd be much obliged.... =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, since no post like this is really any good without the files involved, what follows is the script (process-mail) and the .procmailrc file (which is pretty bare bones and doesn't filter much of anything):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# .procmailrc
#

HOME="/home/mailer"
SHELL=/bin/sh
VERBOSE=off
LOGFILE=$HOME/.procmail/procmail.log
# inserts a blank line between log entries
LOG="
"

:0
*^content-Type:
{
    :0fw
    | /usr/bin/python $HOME/bin/process-mail
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this does is call the process-mail script.  It will/may eventually filter on subject and sender if I find that unwanted emails are triggering new bugs.  For the moment I don't particularly care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the process-mail python script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

        else:

            a_file = open(attachment, 'rb')
        foo = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdin=a_file, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0]
        a_file.close()

        else:
            log.write('Failed to attach bug to bugzilla!\n')

log.close()

sys.exit(0)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Previous posts talked about pulling parts of a subversion repository into a git repo -- effectively taking one svn repo apart into multiple git repos.  This time I just needed to do a straight conversion, however I needed to exclude one single directory from ever being a part of the history of the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was a fairly important repo to convert, I did a few trial runs first and ended up scripting it since there isn't just a single command to do what I needed.  Essentially, we are doing a git clone from a subversion repository (a standard one with trunk/, tags/, branches/ this time), but excluding one directory (we'll call it private).  I also wanted to convert the svn branches to tags since that's effectively what they were.  Also, since the git repository was not local, and for the sake of expediency I didn't want to tar something up and email it, we're taking our converted-and-cleaned-up new git repo, changing the upstream, and then pushing the whole thing to a remote bare repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready?  (Note: a few lines are manually wrapped with '\' below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
WORKDIR="/srv/svn2git/git"
REMOTE="git+ssh://remote.git.host/myrepo.git"
mkdir -p ${WORKDIR}

pushd ${WORKDIR}
git svn clone https://remote.svn.host/repos/myrepo --no-metadata \
  -A /srv/svn2git/authors-transform.txt --stdlayout \
  --ignore-paths="^trunk/private" ${WORKDIR}/from-svn
cd from-svn
git init --bare ../bare.git
cd ../bare.git
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/trunk
cd ../from-svn
git remote add bare ../bare.git
git config remote.bare.push 'refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*'
git push bare
cd ../bare.git
git branch -m trunk master
for x in branch_one branch_two branch_three; do
    git tag "${x}" refs/heads/${x}
    git branch -D ${x}
done

cd ..
git clone bare.git myrepo
cd myrepo
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin ${REMOTE}
git config remote.origin.push 'refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*'
git config master.remote origin
git config master.merge refs/head/master
git push --set-upstream origin master
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is all there was too it.  The svn authors file was created ny using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ svn log -q | awk -F '|' '/^r/ {sub("^ ", "", $2); sub(" $", "", $2); \
print $2" = "$2" &lt;"$2"&gt;"}' | sort -u &gt; authors-transform.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;

Usually it works pretty good.  I didn't really have much good experience with PreUpgrade the few times I tried it, so I wanted to give &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedUp"&gt;FedUp&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my Parallels Fedora 17 VM it worked amazingly well.  So decided to try it on my laptop, which is also running Fedora 17.  I think it makes sense to do a little bit of house-keeping before running it though, and the FedUp page doesn't mention any of this (perhaps it's no longer needed?).  Anyways, a few steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum install rpmconf; rpmconf -a&lt;/code&gt; (review any .rpmnew/.rpmsave files, merge changes as required)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;find /etc /var -name '&lt;em&gt;?.rpm?&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; (find any other old .rpmnew/.rpmsave files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum install yum-utils; package-cleanup --leaves&lt;/code&gt; (review and remove any unused packages, not all will be removable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;package-cleanup --orphans&lt;/code&gt; (find and remove any orphan packages no longer in the repositories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can run FedUp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yum install fedup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fedup-cli --network 18 --debuglog /root/fedupdebug.log&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this completes without error (check the log), you can reboot.  At grub you'll see a "System Upgrade" entry.  When that's done, it'll reboot into Fedora 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wiki page talks about upgrading GRUB2 since you'll be booting from Fedora 17's GRUB2.  If you've got a BIOS-based system, you can use the &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GRUB_2#Updating_GRUB_2_configuration_on_BIOS_systems"&gt;Updating GRUB2 configuration on BIOS systems&lt;/a&gt; instructions.  For those using UEFI, instructions are on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also want to run &lt;code&gt;package-cleanup --orphans&lt;/code&gt; after you do the upgrade as well, just to get rid of any other leftovers.  The only issue I discovered so far with the upgrade is that Google Chrome didn't work out-of-the-box.  However, doing a &lt;code&gt;yum remove google-chrome-stable; yum install google-chrome&lt;/code&gt; got that sorted out (although it did install the unstable version; the stable version had issues with missing libraries and wouldn't load).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, upgrading from Fedora 17 to 18 went a heck of a lot smoother than a fresh install did.  I also got to see what the new GDM/GNOME looks like (quite nice, actually, although I think I'll give MATE a try on the laptop as well because, while GNOME3 is pretty, I definitely preferred GNOME2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good job, Fedora-folks!  Now I just have to upgrade my main workstation, but I think I'm going to play on the laptop for a bit before taking that step.

I'm no stranger to alternative boot/service management systems but it indeed makes me chuckle when people were complaining about Annvix using runit to manage the init system.  I definitely appreciate the work gone into Systemd (having done a similar thing myself for Annvix although obviously not anywhere near the scale/scope of Systemd!), so do want to learn it as opposed to using old scripts as a crutch-interface to the new stuff.  So as I likely stumble across various bits of useful info, I'll be adding it to that wiki article if anyone else is interested in checking it out (or perhaps giving me tips... like how the heck do I actually get gettys to run in graphical.target!!

I use Fedora 17 on a laptop and a desktop, but I also have copies in virtual machines that I use for testing -- these virtual machines run in VMware Fusion on my Mac Pro.  So never having used Fedora 18 during any of the betas or anything, first thing I did was try to install it in VMware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the new Anaconda UI.  One of the things I appreciated about Anaconda in the past is that it was easy to use, but didn't prevent me from doing "power things", like partitioning disks the way I wanted to partition them.  This seems to no longer be the case, and Anaconda does a lot of hand-holding.  It has been a habit to go through the list of packages to be installed (select a group, then go through and weed out the stuff I don't want), so things I don't want don't even touch the disk.  Doesn't seem like I can do this anymore either.  I don't agree with some reviewers who seem to think the UI change is to make it look/feel more mobile or "touchscreen-like", but I do feel it's dumbed down quite a bit which makes me unhappy.  I lived with it, until trying to change the partition layout killed Anaconda.  Twice.  After that I decided to let it do what it wanted since it was just a VM and I didn't care enough to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Fedora gets installed and lo!  A nice blue screen where I can do absolutely &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;.  No icons, no text, no login box, nothing.  Afterwards I read this has to do with having 3D graphics enabled in VMware (but at that point I had already reinstalled to use LXDE rather than GNOME, so I've not tried anything regarding that, however I did find &lt;a href="http://www.greebo.net/2013/01/18/installing-fedora-18-rtm-to-vmware-fusion-5-or-vmware-workstation-9/"&gt;this blog posting about Fedora 18 in VMware Fusion 5/VMware Workstation 9&lt;/a&gt; which explains things a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my home network I run IPA on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to handle my Kerberos/LDAP auth duties.  This means when I install an operating system, no matter what it is, I don't create local users.  So when I installed Fedora 18, I only have the root user and the rest come from IPA.  A few problems with that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Setting up IPA in Anaconda does not work
&lt;li&gt; Post-install, logging in as root at the GUI is not permitted
&lt;li&gt; I have a grub error on tty2, not a login (and nothing on tty3 for that matter)
&lt;li&gt; I have to reboot and edit grub to add &lt;b&gt;systemd.unit=multi-user.target&lt;/b&gt; to boot into the console to get a tty (see &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Systemd#Boot_Kernel_Command_Line"&gt;Systemd: Boot Kernel Command Line&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;li&gt; After I install freeipa-client, I can enroll in the domain
&lt;li&gt; SSSD is not enabled when you install it!  Once again I have to reboot to the console
&lt;li&gt; Enable SSSD and reboot, only to find that once again I cannot login as a user in the GUI (that I could login as on the console)
&lt;li&gt; Head-scratching moment when I realize I know next to nothing about systemd and can only conclude that perhaps NetworkManager starts upon login in the graphical boot and not at system start, which prevents SSSD from talking to IPA to confirm my login
&lt;li&gt; Looking at &lt;i&gt;/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-eth0&lt;/i&gt; tells me that perhaps that is not the case
&lt;li&gt; Big WTF moment and go to bed
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I am unhappy with Fedora 18.  I suppose that on bare metal it probably works better.  I also suppose that with a real user account it works better.  At this point I don't want to do yet another reinstall because then I have to remove the host from IPA and re-enroll, which is annoying (and I really don't want to revisit Anaconda either -- I'll get to do that when I create the 64bit Fedora 18 VM later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, after a few days I tried a few other things.  The first was getting rid of NetworkManager thinking that perhaps it would only start when I login (which I can't, if there is no network, because my login is IPA-based).  So I had to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# systemctl disable NetworkManager.service
# systemctl enable network.service
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most annoying thing, however, is that when I boot into graphical mode, I get no gettys.  I'm pretty sure I told systemd that I want three of them (I have three symlinks in /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants: getty@tty1.service through getty@tty3.service; sadly when I boot into graphical mode and switch to TTY2, I get a grub error message and nothing on TTY3... what the heck?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I did was disable SELinux.  In multi-user.target, I can login as my IPA-user no problem.  With LXDM, however, I never could (assuming, perhaps incorrectly, that network initialization was delayed).  But upon further inspection I see a lot of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
lxdm-binary: pam_selinux(lxdm:session): Setting key creation contect guest_u:guest_r:oddjob_mkhomedir_t:s0 failed: Permission denied
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have zero interest and zero time in making SELinux work with LXDM and since this is a virtual machine, I don't care if SELinux is disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, I can now log into LXDM.  In light of the SELinux thing, I'm thinking that NetworkManager is not to blame (silly me, I made two changes then rebooted -- it could be either one, but I strongly suspect SELinux).  Maybe it would have worked better with GNOME (will try that on the next VM I install).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another side note, since I use VMWare Fusion for the VM, for the tools install (probably the same for the latest VMware Workstation as well, etc.), you may want to check out &lt;a href="http://communities.vmware.com/message/2178685"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.  In particular, seems like linux/version.h is missing and makes the tools angry.  The fix is easy though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# cd /usr/src/kernels/[current_version]/include
# cp generated/uapi/linux/version.h linux/
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can compile the tools.  IIRC, you'll also &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to use the i686 PAE kernel (doesn't seem to work on older versions, I suspect the same may be true with F18).  Easy enough to yum remove the PAE kernels and install the regular kernel.  YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the next day I installed Fedora 18 64-bit in VMWare Fusion.  With the lessons learned above, it was a lot less painful.  I still am not a big fan of Anaconda... I like the look of it, but the practical "working" bits of it definitely need some work.  I don't like that you can pick only one group of packages.  What if I want both GNOME desktop and a working web server?  Doesn't seem like it can be done.  I also like picking through individual packages and sorely miss that -- makes for having to install a bunch of stuff later.  Also not sure why vim isn't installed by default... I think this is the first time ever I've seen "vim: command not found".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, despite getting the VMware tools installed, if you want GDM to present you with anything, you need to disable 3D graphics.  I have it enabled on my 32-bit VM (which is using LXDM, works fine), but on the 64-bit VM (using GDM), even with vmware-tools compiled and running, I needed to disable 3D graphic acceleration.  I suppose there is a bug in the driver and/or X there.  Not a big deal to disable since I've done "yum groupinstall 'MATE Desktop'" (what need do I have for 3D graphics?  BTW, MATE is &lt;i&gt;sweet&lt;/i&gt;!) and now GDM loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPA still would not work to configure from Anaconda.  Definitely a bug to be filed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, time to end this.  This entry has been in the works for about two weeks (sadly, I've not had time to finish it or get my Fedora VM's running until yesterday, and finished up the 64-bit install this morning).  So far the install of Fedora 18, in VMware, has been a bit of a PITA.  Next order of business is to see how the upgrade works... I've got a Fedora 17 install in Parallels to upgrade to make sure all my work-related bits work, before attempting to upgrade on bare metal.  I'm quite certain that a lot of this can be attributed to the virtual machines and it'll work better on bare metal.  I'm also happy that those won't be fresh installs, so I don't have to deal with Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="fedora"></category><category term="ipa"></category><category term="vmware"></category></entry><entry><title>Converting a VMware Fusion virtual machine to KVM</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/converting-a-vmware-fusion-virtual-machine-to-kvm.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-27T15:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-01-27T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2013-01-27:/blog/converting-a-vmware-fusion-virtual-machine-to-kvm.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been running an instance of my Nagios XI monitor in a VMware Fusion virtual machine on my (aging) Mac Pro.

The other day I found a blog post on &lt;a href="http://www.held.org.il/blog/2012/04/how-i-converted-vmware-vm-to-kvm/"&gt;How I converted a VMware VM to KVM&lt;/a&gt; and since my new LAN server is a beefy 8-core AMD FX-8120 with 32GB RAM (as opposed to the 2 x 2.66GHz dual-core Xeon with 16GB RAM that is my 5(?) year old Mac Pro), I decided to try moving the VMware Fusion VM to running on my Linux server (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 with KVM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to be redundant on the steps noted in the other blog post, but to be a bit more explicit, we'll just go through the steps as I did notice a few errors (I'm assuming that blog post was written on some version of Ubuntu; I'm of course using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 host).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog notes to run the &lt;i&gt;qemu-img convert&lt;/i&gt; command on the non-wildcard vmdk file; however, I found that I needed to convert the multi-file image into a single disk image first, before it could be converted.  This may be the case for VMware Workstation disk images as well, however keep in mind we're using VMware Fusion 5 on OS X, so the tool we want is inside the VMware Fusion application bundle (specifically, we want the &lt;i&gt;vmware-vdiskmanager&lt;/i&gt; program).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before converting, however, I strongly recommend removing any existing snapshots of the virtual machine.  The first time I did this, I got the original snapshot which had the guest running CentOS 5.6 (and I updated it to 5.9 this morning before starting this).  So before converting anything, you probably need to remove any existing snapshots first.  Then, on the mac, convert this multi-file image into a single image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cd /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library
$ ./vmware-vdiskmanager -r ~/Documents/nagiosxi.vmwarevm/nagiosxi.vmdk \
    -t 0 ~/Desktop/nagiosxi.vmdk

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also gets rid of all of the extra VMware stuff like snapshots, etc.  Copy this new vmdk file, as well as the vmx file in the container, to the Linux box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, convert the new image file to QCOW2 format (the original blog post didn't specify the output format; qemu-img defaults to a raw file which we don't want, we want QCOW2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#  qemu-img convert nagiosxi.vmdk -O qcow2 /srv/virt/images/nagiosxi.img
# ls /srv/virt/images/nagiosxi.img -l
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 10737418240 Jan 27 08:33 /srv/virt/images/nagiosxi.img

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems more reasonable.  But we need to change permissions so that libvirt can read it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# chown qemu:qemu /srv/virt/images/nagiosxi.img
# chmod 600 /srv/virt/images/nagiosxi.img

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to use the &lt;i&gt;vmware2libvirt&lt;/i&gt; script to convert the vmx file to an XML file for libvirt.  Unfortunately, this only seems to ship with Ubuntu.  Fortunately, we can grab the script from &lt;a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-virt/virt-goodies/trunk/view/head:/vmware2libvirt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It's just a python script with no dependencies, so run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# python vmware2libvirt -f nagiosxi.vmwarevm/nagiosxi.vmx &gt;~/nagiosxi.xml

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we use virsh to import it.  Unfortunately, in this step, virsh is looking for &lt;i&gt;/usr/bin/kvm&lt;/i&gt; and the binary is actually installed as &lt;i&gt;/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm&lt;/i&gt;, so we need to make a symlink first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#  ln -s /usr/libexec/qemu-kvm /usr/bin/kvm
# virsh -c qemu:///system define ~/nagiosxi.xml

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will import the &lt;i&gt;nagiosxi.xml&lt;/i&gt; file to &lt;i&gt;/etc/libvirt/qemu/nagiosxi.xml&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original blog post talked about using the virt-manager GUI to finalize things, and since I'm lazy and don't know libvirt well enough to do all this on the commandline, we'll do the same thing.  Since that machine runs headless without a GUI, I need to ssh in as root with X forwarding and run virt-manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the GUI, I can see my nagiosxi VM defined, so I select it and edit the virtual machine details.  I need to remove the existing IDE Disk 1 (which points to the vmdk file) and add my converted image file.  Essentially:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; "Add Hardware" -&gt; "Storage" -&gt; "Managed or other existing storage" -&gt; Pick your new file
&lt;li&gt; Select "Storage Format" -&gt; Pick qcow2
&lt;li&gt; Click "Finish"
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also want to add a few more bits of hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Serial&lt;/b&gt;: Device type: pty
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Network&lt;/b&gt;: Host device: br0, Device model: virtio
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, there was no network device, and the serial console is useful for using commands like "virsh console" (but you have to setup the serial getty inside the VM for this to work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to startup the new virtual machine.  Once you have gotten it up and running, you'll want to remove the vmware-tools that were installed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="kvm"></category><category term="vmware"></category></entry><entry><title>Replaced my Kerberos+LDAP setup with FreeIPA</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/replaced-my-kerberosldap-setup-with-freeipa.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-12-12T20:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-12-12T20:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2012-12-12:/blog/replaced-my-kerberosldap-setup-with-freeipa.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I've been having to deal with some IPA-related bugs in the past little bit, which of course got me thinking that I had no idea what IPA did or how to use it (thankfully I wasn't responsible for fixing the bugs!).

But as I had to deal with this issues to some degree, I got to figure out what FreeIPA was and what it did.  In short, FreeIPA &lt;b&gt;rocks&lt;/b&gt;.  As many of you know, I've written quite a few articles and blog posts about using Kerberos or OpenLDAP for authentication.  It's no secret that I make heavy use of Linux at home, but also of the Mac, so for me any solution needs to deal with both in a semi-reasonable way.  I could do Kerberos auth on OS X easily enough, but never did have luck with LDAP.  On Linux, it's a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using Kerberos and LDAP at home for years, largely because I have to do a lot of testing of things in virtual machines, so when a new version of something comes out (new Fedora, new major version of RHEL, etc.), I spin up a new VM and install it.  Using Kerberos and LDAP make the setup a breeze, and if I change my password, I'm not changing it on 20-odd systems/virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to say that FreeIPA exceeded my expectations, despite a bit of a rocky start (due to my not reading enough of the docs, annoyingly enough).  I've now got it in place, it's doing Kerberos+LDAP on the Linux clients and &lt;b&gt;also&lt;/b&gt; on the Macs!  I have, for the first time ever (not counting OS X server 10.4 or something, and using OpenDirectory), gotten to login to an OS X system with network credentials.  I've also made use of the DogTag CA and had my internal mediawiki instance (which used mod_auth_kerb for SSO authentication) also use HTTPS now with mod_nss and my shiny new IPA CA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a bunch more about FreeIPA than what I've done so far.  I've just scratched the surface (and even that, not entirely as I've still got a dozen or so systems/vms to switch from the old Kerberos+LDAP setup to using FreeIPA), but I'm looking forward to playing with the other things like a hopefully much easier kerberized NFSv4, storing sudo configs in the directory, auto-mounted home directories (don't care too much about that for the workstations but that will be &lt;i&gt;sweet&lt;/i&gt; for the virtual machines), and so on.  FreeIPA has a really really nice package that takes care of all this stuff and I'm kinda kicking myself that I didn't play with it sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, because of my really odd love for this sort of thing, I've written an article on my wiki: &lt;a href="/Using_FreeIPA_for_User_Authentication"&gt;Using FreeIPA for User Authentication&lt;/a&gt; which goes into the whole setup and enrolment.  A lot of it is covered in the upstream docs, but the upstream docs only got to OS X 10.4, so my 10.7/10.8 setup required a bit more futzing and research.  While I'm "officially" calling this article done, as I spend time over the Christmas holidays playing around with it, I will no doubt be adding more info as I discover it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="ipa"></category><category term="kerberos"></category><category term="ldap"></category></entry><entry><title>Git commit hook to bugzilla using git-notifier</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/git-commit-hook-to-bugzilla-using-git-notifier.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-21T18:49:00-06:00</published><updated>2012-09-21T18:49:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2012-09-21:/blog/git-commit-hook-to-bugzilla-using-git-notifier.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of the &lt;a href="http://www.icir.org/robin/git-notifier/"&gt;git-notifier&lt;/a&gt; script, which acts as a hook in git to send you nice emails about things that have changed in your git repos.

I'm also a bugzilla user, so I wanted to be able to put git commit notifications, automatically, in bugzilla if "bug #X" is in the commit log.  Initially I was intending to use &lt;a href="http://www.theoldmonk.net/gitzilla/"&gt;gitzilla&lt;/a&gt; for this, but I didn't feel like attempting to make it work with the latest release of &lt;a href="https://github.com/williamh/pybugz"&gt;pybugz&lt;/a&gt; (says it is tested with version 0.8.0 but the current version is 0.10.1.  In retrospect, that might have actually been easier.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I decided to use git-notifier to send an email to bugzilla (while gitzilla uses XMLRPC, which would have been preferable, I also have incoming email support enabled in bugzilla).  It took some trial and error, but I got it working (although I suspect there are easier ways to do it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I had to do was patch git-notifier to accept a bug id, because bugzilla needs to know what bug to route the incoming email to.  This was very easy to do (I'll be sending this upstream to see if they want to include it, but I may also change it to pull more info from the git config so that the post-receive hook doesn't have to be so obscene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works, and works well, but the post-receive hook is messy.  What used to just be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
/srv/git/hooks/git-notifier $@ --link="http://[url];a=commitdiff;h=%s" \
  --emailprefix="[git: [repo]]"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has now turned into this monstrosity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
while read oldrev newrev refname
do
    commit=$(git rev-parse $newrev)
done

bzemail="bugzilla-daemon@bugzilla.me.com"

/srv/git/hooks/git-notifier $@ --link="http://[url];a=commitdiff;h=%s" \
  --emailprefix="[git: [repo]]"

for BUG in $(git log ${commit} -n 1 | sed 's/bug #/bug#/g' | \
  egrep -i -o 'bug#[0-9]*'); do
    BUGID=$(echo "${BUG}" | sed 's/bug#//i')
    EMAIL=$(git log ${commit} -n 1 --pretty=format:"%ae")
    test=$(echo "$BUGID" | sed 's/[0-9]*//g')
    if [ "${test}x" = "x" ]; then
    # make sure it is a digit
        /srv/git/hooks/git-notifier $@ --link="http://[url];a=commitdiff;h=%s" \
  --emailprefix="[git: [repo]]" --bug_id=${BUGID} --mailinglist=${bzemail} \
  --sender=${EMAIL} --manual=${commit}
    fi
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(lines wrapped for readability)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while it's fugly, there's quite a bit of magic to it.  Seems that when you call git-notifier again, it won't send an email because it knows it's already been sent, which is why we need the commit hash, and feed it to it with the --manual option.  The --mailinglist option is used to point to bugzilla (again, the git-notifier config is pointing to another email address to receive the commits already, so we need to override it).  The --sender option takes the committer's email address as the value (the $EMAIL variable), which also overrides the default git-notifier sender (which is the local user on the system unless you're using gitolite (which I'm not)).  The --bug_id is a digit to reference the bug in the commit (this should also send multiple mails if more than one bug is referenced in the commit, but I've not tested that yet).  The end result is you get a copy of the git commit directly into bugzilla, in the same format that you would get it via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may spend some time later on trying to make gitzilla play nicely with the newer version of pybugz, but for now this scratches my itch.  Like I said, not the prettiest solution, but it works as a quick-n-dirty hack.  The inspiration for using email to send this to bugzilla was from Gentoo's &lt;a href="http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Bugzilla_Email#Subversion_Integration"&gt;Bugzilla Email&lt;/a&gt; wiki entry (the subversion integration part in particular).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that since the email is being sent as the committer, the committer needs to have an account with that email address in your bugzilla.  If not, bugzilla's email_in.pl will bounce it back.  So you may want to have a bugzilla "commits" account as a dummy account from which you can email these things if not all of your committers have bugzilla access or use the same email address in bugzilla that they do in git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any suggestions on a better way to do this (particularly via XMLRPC which I think would be a nicer way to go), I'm all ears.  (Short of writing my own -- I could do this, having worked with bugzilla and lately with XMLRPC access, quite a bit -- I'm too lazy to write something from scratch)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="bugzilla"></category><category term="git"></category></entry><entry><title>Software Update Service on OS X Lion Server</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/software-update-service-on-os-x-lion-server.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-23T17:44:00-06:00</published><updated>2012-08-23T17:44:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2012-08-23:/blog/software-update-service-on-os-x-lion-server.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Software Update Service is part of OS X Lion server (and Mountain Lion server) that allows you to download OS updates and serve them to multiple clients on a local network (similar to Red Hat's Satellite server, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux).

I've had to play with this because we're bandwidth-restricted at the church, and there are a lot of macs there, all of which need security and bugfix updates.  Attempting to download each of these updates, online, is a painful experience, so Lion Server was a logical route to take.  Except that it's annoying as all get out, and was painful to get up and running.  So this is just some notes on how I managed to get it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need (Mountain) Lion Server, and you need the Server Admin application, from where you can enable SUS (Software Update Server).  I attempted to do it transparently because I control DNS on the local network, but while this seemed to work with Lion, it doesn't seem to work with Mountain Lion... not quite sure why yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed this tutorial: &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/stupidmactricks/home/transparentsoftwareupdateserverusingmacosxlionserver107"&gt;Transparent Software Update Server using Mac OS X Lion Server 10.7&lt;/a&gt; to get me up and running.  I did notice, however, that I was not getting any updates downloaded that had been posted after May 2012, and eventually tracked it down to the IP address it recommends putting in /etc/hosts.  Do &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; use 17.250.248.95 for swscan.apple.com!  The line to add to the SUS server's /etc/hosts file is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
17.164.1.22 swscan.apple.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will get you all current updates, including Mountain Lion updates.  A few other things to note (since I need SUS to handle OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8).  The mod_rewrite section on /etc/swupd/swupd.conf should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Darwin/9
    RewriteRule ^/index\.sucatalog$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}/cgi-bin/SoftwareUpdateServerGetCatalog?/index-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Darwin/10
    RewriteRule ^/index\.sucatalog$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}/cgi-bin/SoftwareUpdateServerGetCatalog?/index-leopard-snowleopard.merged-1.sucatalog
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Darwin/11
    RewriteRule ^/index\.sucatalog$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}/cgi-bin/SoftwareUpdateServerGetCatalog?/index-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Darwin/12
    RewriteRule ^/index\.sucatalog$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}/cgi-bin/SoftwareUpdateServerGetCatalog?/index-mountainlion-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog
&amp;lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Sorry, the above looks a bit messed up, but you should be able to copy-n-paste it).  And my /etc/swupd/swupd.plist looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&amp;lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&amp;lt;dict&gt;
    &amp;lt;key&gt;PurgeUnused&amp;lt;/key&gt;
    &amp;lt;true/&gt;
    &amp;lt;key&gt;autoEnable&amp;lt;/key&gt;
    &amp;lt;true/&gt;
    &amp;lt;key&gt;autoMirror&amp;lt;/key&gt;
    &amp;lt;true/&gt;
    &amp;lt;key&gt;autoMirrorOnlyNew&amp;lt;/key&gt;
    &amp;lt;false/&gt;
    &amp;lt;key&gt;limitBandwidth&amp;lt;/key&gt;
    &amp;lt;false/&gt;
    &amp;lt;key&gt;otherCatalogs&amp;lt;/key&gt;
    &amp;lt;array&gt;
        &amp;lt;string&gt;index-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog&amp;lt;/string&gt;
        &amp;lt;string&gt;index-leopard-snowleopard.merged-1.sucatalog&amp;lt;/string&gt;
        &amp;lt;string&gt;index-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog&amp;lt;/string&gt;
        &amp;lt;string&gt;index-mountainlion-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog&amp;lt;/string&gt;
    &amp;lt;/array&gt;
    &amp;lt;key&gt;portToUse&amp;lt;/key&gt;
    &amp;lt;integer&gt;8088&amp;lt;/integer&gt;
    &amp;lt;key&gt;syncBandwidth&amp;lt;/key&gt;
    &amp;lt;integer&gt;0&amp;lt;/integer&gt;
    &amp;lt;key&gt;updatesDocRoot&amp;lt;/key&gt;
    &amp;lt;string&gt;/var/db/swupd/&amp;lt;/string&gt;
    &amp;lt;key&gt;valueBandwidth&amp;lt;/key&gt;
    &amp;lt;integer&gt;0&amp;lt;/integer&gt;
&amp;lt;/dict&gt;
&amp;lt;/plist&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With those changes, I can serve the updates to my mac clients, but not on Mountain Lion.  On Mountain Lion clients you need to run this command to explicitly point to the SUS server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL http://[SUS_SERVER]:8088/index.sucatalog
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when you launch the App Store and check for updates, it will find any new Mountain Lion updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For transparent updates on earlier versions of OS X, I added the following to my DNS server's named.conf:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
zone "swscan.apple.com" {
    type master;
    file "master/swscan.apple.com.zone";
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the swscan.apple.com.zone file contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$TTL    86400
@       IN SOA  swscan.apple.com. root.mydomain.com. (
                    2012060201      ; serial (d. adams)
                    12H     ; refresh
                    15M     ; retry
                    1W      ; expiry
                    1D )        ; minimum
            IN NS       dns.mydomain.com.
        IN MX       10 smtp.mydomain.com.

localhost   IN A        127.0.0.1
swscan.apple.com. IN A      192.168.0.10
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect there is another domain name that needs to be resolved somewhere in addition to swscan.apple.com, but I've not had the time to track it down as of yet.  An easy way to check is on Lion and earlier if you run "sudo softwareupdate -l" and watch the logs on your SUS, you'll see the connections from that client.  The same does not happen with Mountain Lion clients unless you do the "defaults write" command noted earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone knows how to make Mountain Lion clients connect to the SUS transparently, I would love to hear about how you got it to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="swupd"></category></entry><entry><title>Teagan needs help</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/teagan-needs-help.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-07T12:15:00-06:00</published><updated>2012-06-07T12:15:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2012-06-07:/blog/teagan-needs-help.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.treatment4teagan.org/images/cascade08.jpg" alt="Teagan" /&gt;I don't normally post things like this... how could you?

With so much need in the world, you could post about kids every day, multiple times a day, and still not cover them all.  But this one is special.  Teagan is a family friend, and so I have to mention it in the hopes that there are people reading who will contribute a little to help with her recovery.  Just over a year ago, Teagan had a prolonged seizure that caused severe brain damage.  As a result, she was left blind, unable to communicate, and had lost full control of her body -- but she was fully aware of what was going on around her.  In the last year she has come a long way from that point, but is still not fully functioning yet.  Now the family has the opportunity to bring Teagan to the Life Functional Neurology Center in Marietta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.treatment4teagan.org/"&gt;www.treatment4teagan.org&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of information about her and the treatment the family is seeking.  You can also donate there; they need $10,000 to get her down there for a week of assessment, treatment (this includes travel and accommodation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has happened to Teagan has profoundly affected our family.  Her parents were married out at my in-law's acreage.  My daughter is close friends with Teagan's older sister (in fact, she's going for a sleep over tomorrow!).  Her family is like extended family to us, and we've seen what's been going on.  I don't normally ask for money or donations, but this is a worthy cause.  If you find it in your heart to donate a few dollars to help get Teagan the treatment that can give her her life back, please do so.  We would all very much appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Apache mod_rewrite frustration</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/apache-mod_rewrite-frustration.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-05-05T16:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2012-05-05T16:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2012-05-05:/blog/apache-mod_rewrite-frustration.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear lazyweb, I'm having severe issues with Apache's mod_rewrite on my VPS.

&amp;lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked fine when the root of the site had nothing but a simple index.html in it.  Now I've got Drupal7 installed, so it does all the fancy mod_rewrite stuff to get the clean urls, etc.  And now when I go to https://site/dav, Drupal is answering and saying "no such directory".  If I have /home/user/dav for the private WebDAV share, I'm using /home/user/public_html/ for the accessible web site (I do this to prevent any accidental exposure to those data files).  Incidentally I tried with both &amp;lt;Location&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;Directory&amp;gt; and it makes no difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The .htaccess in /home/user/public_html/ looks like this (just the important bits):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
  RewriteEngine on

  RewriteRule ^/dav(/.*)$ /dav/$1 [L,QSA]

  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]

&amp;lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried a number of variations (the above is my latest try).  Also tried things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/dav
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With and without the extra .* bits, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am literally tearing my hear out here.  Does anyone have any idea what I'm doing wrong?  I basically want it to go "hey, you want /dav?  ok, I won't rewrite anything and you can have it) and have /dav/[whatever] loaded requiring auth to access.  Something in the mod_rewrite is killing it, and I suspect it might have to do with Alias.  Maybe all this stuff needs to be in httpd.conf instead of .htaccess?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="apache"></category><category term="mod_rewrite"></category></entry><entry><title>Starting second sleeve</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/starting-second-sleeve.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-10T20:40:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-03-10T20:40:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2012-03-10:/blog/starting-second-sleeve.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So this past Wednesday I started on finishing up the second sleeve (my right arm).

Since most external drives you buy these days are USB3, and the Mac Pro only has (and perhaps only every will have, if the rumour mill is true) USB2 ports, the only option I had for expansion was a USB3 card.  The Mac Pro doesn't have Thunderbolt on it, and the external drives equipped with Thunderbolt are prohibitively expensive right now, so USB3 looked to be a better bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card cost me under $150CAD, including shipping from the US.  This card is pretty sweet; it has four ports on it so you can have four external drives, but beyond that you can also set them up as RAID0, RAID1, RAID5, or RAID10, and JBOD.  There also seems to be a way you can bond the four ports together if the cables all go to the same storage device (I don't know of any such devices at the moment though, and I imagine they're probably right up there in cost with a Thunderbolt storage device).  Individually, the ports are 5Gb/s, bonded you can supposedly get 20GB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did a few tests, and this card has seriously impressed me.  I copied a 2GB file around in random ways to measure the speeds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; From internal SATA2 drive to USB2 drive: 1:02.98s
&lt;li&gt; From internal SATA2 drive to the same drive: 20.952s
&lt;li&gt; From internal SATA2 drive to another internal SATA2 drive: 25.050s
&lt;li&gt; From internal SATA2 drive to USB3 drive: 19.652s
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about wow.  Note it was the exact same drive, first connected to a USB2 port and then connected to a USB3 port.  The speed increase on USB2 to USB3 is insane.  What's even more astonishing to me is that the transfer speeds were faster to the USB3 drive than to another internal drive.  I suppose if the guts of this thing had SATA3 it would be a different story though.  Since I don't think I'll be getting SATA3 in this thing anytime soon (and since I have run out of space for expansion cards due to the second double-high video card I've got in here), I suppose I'll have to live with it.  All in all, I think this was a good investment to make.  If I run out of room internally, I don't have to worry about just using external drives for "sometimes" access, but I imagine it would work well enough to run a virtual machine off of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="usb3"></category></entry><entry><title>SSD Speed-ups on Mac Pro</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/ssd-speed-ups-on-mac-pro.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-02-26T14:19:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-02-26T14:19:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2012-02-26:/blog/ssd-speed-ups-on-mac-pro.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have an SSD in my Fedora workstation for my &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/rq/"&gt;rq&lt;/a&gt; tool, specifically for the MySQL database.

The speed increase there, because it was dealing with huge amounts of data, was very welcome -- not so much for importing (speed there didn't much increase since all the files being operated on were on the HDD), but for querying it is wicked fast.  Besides that, and the built-in SSD of my MacBook Air, I've not used SSD before as it is just too expensive.  I'm a data storage junkie, so I opted more for large storage than fast access (and the price per GB of SSDs is a little too rich for me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I picked up the first SSD that I've bought (the other SSD in my Fedora box is a loaner from a friend).  It's a 240GB OCZ Agility 3, and it's still over $1/GB which is a bit nuts, but since I have an extra SATA connection in my Mac Pro, I figured I'd give it a go.  This rig is pretty good: 2 quad core Xeon CPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 8TB HDD space including the one external USB drive.  The only real bottle-neck on this thing is disk I/O, so I figured I would give the whole SSD thing a go, since I knew I'd get better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an impromptu timer on my phone, from chime to login screen, it took 3:07.7 minutes, and from when I hit enter at the login screen until all the apps were open and ready for use it took another 3:54.9 minutes (some of this is network-bound, as I waited for Chrome to reload its two windows with 27 tabs, and there are other hefty apps like iTunes (with a massive library), EagleFiler, Daylite, Mail, and quite a few others).  So from turning the machine on to when I could use it was roughly 7 minutes.  After installing the SSD and cloning my boot drive to it (and doing a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of file moving so it would all fit!), then rebooting it once so any caches would be updated, I rebooted again and timed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From chime to login screen took 35.3 seconds.  From login to all items ready for us took 43.0 seconds.  So my boot time went from 7 minutes, to under 1.5 minutes all told.  I think this is the best $300 I ever dropped.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="ssd"></category></entry><entry><title>rpm -V and prelinked binaries</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/rpm-v-and-prelinked-binaries.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-23T16:38:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-01-23T16:38:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2012-01-23:/blog/rpm-v-and-prelinked-binaries.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'v been asked this question a few times over the last year or so, so I thought I would explain some of why you might see some issues on a Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system (or any other Linux distribution that uses prelinked binaries) when trying to track …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'v been asked this question a few times over the last year or so, so I thought I would explain some of why you might see some issues on a Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system (or any other Linux distribution that uses prelinked binaries) when trying to track down strange MD5/SHA1 changes to binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, and for nearly a decade now, prelink has shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora.  What it does is modify the ELF code in binaries and libraries to speed up load times, so that fewer relocations need to be resolved when executing a program.  I can't explain all the details and technicalities of it because, quite frankly, they are above my limited brainpower to explain.  Suffice it to say, prelinking is a good thing.  Unless you are using AIDE or Tripwire.  These programs determine whether or not a file has changed based on their MD5SUM or SHA1SUM (or any other *SUM of the binary).  So when you install a program, AIDE sees a certain MD5SUM of the binary.  Later, when prelink runs, that binary might be modified to do the aforementioned relocations.  This will result in a different MD5SUM of the binary, and AIDE will most certainly tell you about the change.  What does not inform you of the change, however, is rpm -V (or rpm --verify).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verification command in RPM tells it to compare the MD5SUM of the files in certain package to what is on the filesystem.  It's a poor man's AIDE, and can also tell you what has changed on your system (from what RPM expects according to when it was installed).  In theory, you would expect rpm -V to report the same discrepancy that AIDE does.  The fact that it doesn't is what's led to a few questions regarding this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "problem" (if you can call it that) is that rpm knows about prelink, and knows how to deal with it.  As is succinctly explained in this &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/shrike-list/2003-April/msg00592.html"&gt;mailing list email&lt;/a&gt;, "rpm when --verify will prelink --verify, which is essentially --undo followed by prelinking again and comparing."  So the reason that rpm doesn't fail the verification is that it is basically turning off prelink for the file(s) to check, running the verification, then turning prelink back on.  This is why rpm won't report on a MD5SUM change, but AIDE will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those of us who use AIDE, we know that we need to do things like daily runs to make sure nothing has changed.  The problem is that if you do this and run a yum update, X number of hours later you'll get an email telling you that files have changed.  You might, at that point, update AIDE but there is a window of opportunity there where you may miss things.  We can minimize this by doing an AIDE check, then yum update, then force a prelink run, then update AIDE.  I've been doing this for a few years on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and it essentially gets rid of all false positives.  It's a little script called &lt;b&gt;do-update&lt;/b&gt; that I execute as root and it runs this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
aidecheck &amp;&amp; yum update -y &amp;&amp; /etc/cron.daily/prelink &amp;&amp; aideupdate
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't eliminate the window of opportunity completely, but it does lessen it considerably.  This uses my &lt;a href="https://github.com/vdanen/AIDE_gpg"&gt;AIDE_gpg&lt;/a&gt; scripts (aidecheck and aideupdate).  The rest is pretty self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this information will be useful to someone.  It took me a bit to dig up the mailing list message I link to above; I knew that prelink was had some special relationship with rpm, but I didn't know the particulars.  Now I do, and so do you.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="rpm"></category><category term="aide"></category></entry><entry><title>Some quick git tips</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/some-quick-git-tips.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-05T12:16:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-01-05T12:16:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2012-01-05:/blog/some-quick-git-tips.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I've been git-ifying some stuff around here, I've run into a few tips that might be useful for other git beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to setup some global options, some of which are nice for folks coming from Subversion.  Having a global ignore file is useful.  Mine has the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
*~
*.orig
*.rej
*.swp
.#*
*.o
.DS_Store
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then adjust some global git options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
$ git config --global alias.st status
$ git config --global alias.ci commit
$ git config --global alias.co checkout
$ git config --global alias.br branch
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email you@example.com
$ git config --global core.editor "vim"
$ git config --global color.branch auto
$ git config --global color.diff auto
$ git config --global color.interactive auto
$ git config --global color.status auto
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few allow for colorized output, which I like (makes things like git status easier to read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found out that I had screwed up the remote origin when setting up a new repository, and didn't want to re-do everything, so found this useful one-liner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ git remote rm origin
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git n00bs like me will appreciate the above.  =)  (Note to self, express git urls as ssh://git.remote.com/path/to/repo.git rather than ssh://git.remote.com:/path/to/repo.git!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I found an excellent resource called &lt;a href="http://qugstart.com/blog/ruby-and-rails/create-a-new-git-remote-repository-from-some-local-files-or-local-git-repository/"&gt;Create a new Git Remote Repository from some local files (or local git repository)&lt;/a&gt;.

My initial plans were to do the family things one normally does around Christmas time, and there was plenty of that... visits with the parents and in-laws, dinners and whatnot.  Too much food as usual, but that's what the exercise bike is for.  So the 21st was my last working day, and is customary for me, the beginnings of a cold started to settle in.  I think my remedy for colds is to work, seems like whenever I take time off, a cold settles in to ruin it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from a few bouts of Skyrim with my daughter, the major distraction (of what I thought I'd be spending my time studying for my RHCE and RHCSA tests) was helping my wife and sister-in-law setup a new catering/cafeteria company.  Here in Edmonton we have a city-owned recreation facility called the ACT Rec Centre where you can go swimming, rent rooms for various occasions, and so forth.  The fellow who ran the cafeteria there decided to retire from it, so the city opened up a call for bids to take over the cafeteria and on-site catering.  This is actually a really sweet deal, as it's a contract with the city so there is no huge upfront cost in leasing a building or anything like that.  It's a small settings, so perfectly reasonable to have 2-3 people working in there at a time, so no huge staffing costs either.  So my wife put together a bid package for her and her sister earlier in December and found out they won the bid on Dec 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to that point, everything was provisional on the contract being awarded.  No company was established, nothing.  There was no point to invest all the costs of setting up business if there was no contract to run, because setting up something else would be ridiculously expensive.  So once we knew the bid was awarded, the race was on.  The city wanted them up and running by January 3rd (ha!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, to make a long story short, as soon as businesses opened, there was no time for studying and hardly any time for Skyrim &lt;sniff&gt;.  It was getting everything together to incorporate the business, getting into the facility to do cleaning (to start completely fresh), and so on.  I, of course, was tasked with setting up the web site which needed to be done so that they had somewhere to point prospective clients for catering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to say that &lt;a href="http://sunshinesisterscafe.com/"&gt;sunshinesisterscafe.com&lt;/a&gt; went live last night, and my only responsibilities from this point forward is to apply elbow grease and help with the cleaning and organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running my own consulting business since 2000, and I must say, starting a food services business is a heck of a lot more work than setting up a consultancy business!  What an insane amount of work this has been for the last month (and especially the last two weeks), but already some catering gigs are coming in and hopefully they'll all be up and running next week.  It'll be an interesting change of pace for us in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be dealing with their business at arm's length... it's their business after all.  I'm just an investor and a sometime under-paid grunt.  Possibly I'll be helping out on weekends, but we'll see how that pans out.  My wife has taken to this as a fish to water though, and I think they're going to do extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;

There are some various automated tools and mediawiki import/export stuff, but I didn't have a lot in terms of pages so taking a few hours to do this manually was no big deal (and I figured it would save me time rather than fighting with some maybe-working import/export duo's).  The primary reason for this is that I wanted to keep the Annvix info alive yet (that's 4.5 years of development "life"), but I didn't want to maintain what was essentially a read-only wiki.  This way I get both since I need to update the linsec.ca wiki when updates come out.  This also knocked out another wordpress setup from the annvix blog (no need to keep that stuff around really).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, honestly, the biggest pain in the arse was making Apache's rewrite rules work the way I wanted them to.  I still have the annvix.org domain, and moving the subversion viewvc and repo sub-domain is silly and painful (and neither require much effort on my part), so I've left them but still wanted to redirect http://annvix.org/foo to http://linsec.ca/Annvix:foo.  Easy enough without cPanel getting in the way and .htaccess files and whatnot, so I finally got it working after much goatee tugging.  For the interested, the pertinent bits of the .htaccess file I ended up using are below (criticism welcome!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the location of AIDE+gpg in the subversion repo was "tools/AIDE+gpg" and it had one sub-directory, "trunk".  I never did end up using tags or branches or anything there.  So the entire step from start to finish to do it was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git init AIDE
cd AIDE
echo "vdanen = Vincent Danen &lt;[my email]&gt;" &gt;authors.txt
git svn init -T trunk svn+ssh://[repo]/tools/AIDE+gpg --no-metadata

git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/trunk
cd ../AIDE
git remote add bare ../tmp
git config remote.bare.push 'refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*'
git push bare
cd ../tmp
git branch -a
git branch -m trunk master
mv tmp AIDE+gpg.git
&lt;/pre&gt;

I've used subversion for years, and have had it as a big part of my workflow for a really really long time.  Unfortunately, there's this git thing popping up all over the place and I'm starting to feel dated.  (It's bad enough that my daughter turned 10 this month, which makes me feel old, so I have to find other ways of not feeling out-dated!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that all of my version control repos are in subversion, and I hate losing history.  On some, I went through a painful CVS-&amp;gt;SVN migration when I first started using subversion, and I was pleasantly surprised that git makes it quite a bit easier.  I found &lt;a href="http://www.albin.net/git/convert-subversion-to-git"&gt;this blog posting&lt;/a&gt; that helped me (for the most part... if you don't use tags and branches, etc. you want to pay attention when doing some of the steps... took me a bit to figure that out).  Most notably, in steps four and five when changing the "trunk" to "master"; it assumes you have the standard trunk/, tags/, branches/ layout (which I do in some repos, and not in others).  If you use that convention, it works fine.  If not, you can run into problems like I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posting indicates to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git svn clone [SVN repo URL] --no-metadata -A authors-transform.txt \
   --stdlayout ~/temp
...
git init --bare ~/new-bare.git
cd ~/new-bare.git
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/trunk
cd ~/temp
git remote add bare ~/new-bare.git
git config remote.bare.push 'refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*'
git push bare
cd ~/new-bare.git
git branch -m trunk master
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this didn't work for me, as --stdlayout isn't so standard in my case (no tags/trunk/branches, so the top-level is the "trunk").  Instead I had to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git svn clone [svn repo] -A authors-transform.txt ~/tmp/git
cd ~/tmp/git
git init --bare ~/git/scripts.git
git remote add bare ~/git/scripts.git
git config remote.bare.push 'refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*'
git push bare
cd ~/git/scripts.git
git branch -m git-svn master
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the only branch is the "git-svn" branch, so we want to turn "git-svn" into "master" (rather than trying to hunt down some non-existant branch called "trunk").  There might have been a better way to do this, but I'm a n00b so forgive me.  All the explanation for the above is in that blog post I mentioned before (I'm mostly noting this as undoubtably I'll bump my head against this again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other useful links I found were &lt;a href="http://wiki.sourcemage.org/Git_Guide#How_do_I_get_my_copy_of_the_repository.3F"&gt;this git guide&lt;/a&gt; and a piece on &lt;a href="http://gofedora.com/how-to-install-configure-gitweb/"&gt;setting up gitweb on Fedora&lt;/a&gt; (works on RHEL also).  Gitweb was essential, as I'm used to using viewvc with my subversion repos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So will I use git for all my repos?  Probably not.  There are some old ones that don't need to be converted because it's all legacy code, and there are some others that I've built up with too much automation.  I would like to try to extract some pieces of existing subversion repos into git, however.  The AIDE+gpg scripts are one; they're in the Annvix tools repo, and I'd like to try to break it out into it's own git repo with history... not sure if this is possible but I'll poke around and see what I can come up with.  There are a few other Annvix tools that I'd do the same with (the rsec tool for one).  Since Annvix isn't in development anymore, I'd like to "untie" those tools from it and offer them as stand-alone things (probably on github or something).&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to George Notaras for giving me the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently someone other than myself uses these scripts.  =)  AIDE+gpg is a set of scripts to make AIDE more like Tripwire in that the database is cryptographically signed (with gpg) so you can be alerted as to whether or not the AIDE database has been tampered with between runs. It also setups a cron job to check the database against the system daily to alert you of any changes. It is an add-on to AIDE that can be used on any Linux distribution (and probably distributions as well, although you may need to edit the scripts if the binary locations for gpg and aide differ from RHEL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can grab it from the &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/Tools/AIDE_gpg"&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="aide"></category><category term="AIDE+gpg"></category></entry><entry><title>Unwanted guest account in OS X 10.7.2</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/unwanted-guest-account-in-os-x-10-7-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-13T11:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-10-13T11:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2011-10-13:/blog/unwanted-guest-account-in-os-x-10-7-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was thoroughly annoyed to find a guest account with a sandboxed Safari after I had setup iCloud on OS X 10.7.2.

&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, if you have FileVault enabled for full-disk encryption, the guest account login still shows up when the system starts.  This leads me to believe that some of the system preferences and a copy of Safari are stored in the Lion recovery partition.  Annoyingly enough, this includes keys for wireless access points.  I don't know if there is a way to get that information (I suspect not, but you never know), but this means that some things are being stored outside of the FileVault, which concerns me somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Kerberos on OS X 10.7 (Lion)</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/kerberos-on-os-x-10-7-lion.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-26T12:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-07-26T12:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2011-07-26:/blog/kerberos-on-os-x-10-7-lion.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I had upgraded my wife's MacBook to Lion and discovered that, once again, Apple screwed around with Kerberos.

This seems to be a recurring theme (and not a good one).  After quite a bit of fighting and figuring, a few things have been sorted out.  Once I've got it completely figured out, I'll document it on my wiki but in the meantime (since there is a severe shortage of good info about Kerberos in Lion), here's the skinny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; MIT Kerberos has been replaced with Heimdal
&lt;li&gt; Heimdal seems to prefer UDP over TCP; so if your KDC has a firewall in place to block UDP ports 88 and 749, you probably want to change your firewall rules to allow access to UDP (or you get strange errors: kinit says it can't reach any defined KDC, Ticket Viewer says you provided the wrong password)
&lt;li&gt; /Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos is still a valid configuration file, however you need to remove the quotes (e.g if you have &lt;code&gt;default_realm = "FOO.CA"&lt;/code&gt; you need to change that to &lt;code&gt;default_realm = FOO.CA&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;li&gt; Subversion (either Lion-supplied or via Fink) does not seem to do GSSAPI negotiation anymore
&lt;li&gt; Google Chrome on Lion does not seem to do GSSAPI negotiation anymore
&lt;li&gt; Safari on Lion &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; work with Kerberized (mod_auth_kerb) websites
&lt;li&gt; Supposedly you do not need to change /etc/authorization anymore; Lion is using a PAM stack that should give you a ticket upon login (provided your kerberos password and login password are the same (or presumably it is store in your Keychain) -- I've not tested this yet
&lt;li&gt; Someone indicated that you can prefix the KDC hostname in /Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos with "tcp/host" to make Heimdal talk over TCP (preventing the need to open UDP ports), but there is also another indication that this doesn't work -- I've not tested this yet either
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the point is it's messy.  There is an ongoing discussion on the Apple support forums here: &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3189202"&gt;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3189202&lt;/a&gt; so if you're experiencing some oddness (or getting things to work!) please either note in the comments here or on that discussion thread.  I would &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; like to get subversion and Chrome working with kerberos auth again -- those are the only two things preventing me from going forward with Lion on other systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="kerberos"></category></entry><entry><title>Fedora 15 upgrade</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/fedora-15-upgrade.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-09T09:04:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-07-09T09:04:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2011-07-09:/blog/fedora-15-upgrade.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I upgraded my Fedora 14 workstation to Fedora 15 last night using the yum update method (I've used preupgrade a few times and it's worked on some and botched on others (mostly due to not enough space on /boot)).

Since with other distros I've either used apt to do a dist-ugprade or the urpmi equivalent, this is somewhat my preferred upgrade path.  I've done it before and it worked amazingly well, so I did it again last night using these great instructions: &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Upgrading_Fedora_using_yum"&gt;Upgrading Fedora using yum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only gotchya is that due to the replacement of init by systemd, when it came time to reboot, halt/reboot/etc were unable to send the correct signals to something that would shut the machine down, so I had to do a hard reboot (which never plays nice with my RAID arrays, but upon reboot there was no RAID re-sync which is either cool or scary, I'm not yet sure which).  So that was a bit nerve-wracking.  Otherwise it was just a lengthy process with yum telling me I had 2850 packages to deal with (including installing and removing).  Instructions are good and clear.  Highly recommended if you're even moderately technically inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I get a good look at GNOME3, which doesn't work in my Fedora 15 vm's (well, it works, but it looks a lot like GNOME2 due to the "poor" video support in a vm).  I'm not sure what the big deal is... it's a little wonky and takes some getting used to.  I dislike that conky doesn't show up on the desktop, but so far that's my only real complaint.  I had icons for Komodo and CrashPlan on the desktop that are no longer visible, so had to use alacarte ("yum install alacarte; alacarte") to create new icons to go into the GNOME menu system.  Then I could add them to my favourites and was off and running.  It was about 1am when I finished so I haven't had too much time to play with it yet (although I also installed LXDE to give it a go as well, in case I didn't like GNOME3).  So far I don't mind it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else seemed to work out of the box other than my apache configuration file.  I have a few includes in /etc/httpd/conf/vhosts.d/*.conf and they weren't loading, so I think the handling of virtual hosts has changed because once I removed the default virtualhost definition ("&lt;VirtualHost _default_:80&gt;") that I had defined, the virtual hosts worked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I'm pleased.  I've played with F15 in my vm's since it came out (but mostly for testing security issues, etc.) so this is the first workstation with "stuff" that I've upgraded.  So one work vm and one laptop to go and then F14 is history.  Good job on this release, Fedora Folks!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="fedora"></category><category term="yum"></category></entry><entry><title>Nagios XI wizards make setup a snap for network monitoring</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/nagios-xi-wizards-make-setup-a-snap-for-network-monitoring.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-08T20:57:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-07-08T20:57:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2011-07-08:/blog/nagios-xi-wizards-make-setup-a-snap-for-network-monitoring.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my last TechMails to ever be published by TechRepublic is &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/nagios-xi-wizards-make-setup-a-snap-for-network-monitoring/2637"&gt;Nagios XI wizards make setup a snap for network monitoring&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;This is also one of the last TechMails that TechRepublic will be publishing that I've written.  There might be one or two more in the queue yet, I can't remember if everything I've submitted has been published or not.  It has been almost 12 years of writing monthly for TechRepublic -- initially as full length articles and the last few years as blog-style tips (which are both easier and harder to write; you get less words and more topics to cover in a month).  The last year or so I've also been writing Mac tips for TechRepublic, as one of the original contributors to the Mac track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve years is a long time, so it is with mixed feelings that I gave my resignation to TechRepublic last month.  I've worked with some really great editors: Jack, Sonja, Selena... you guys have been great to work with and I will definitely miss working with you.  I think, after a respite from technical writing, that I'll work on updating some of the documentation I have on the &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/"&gt;linsec.ca&lt;/a&gt; wiki, and hopefully finish off a few more that I've started but never completed.  At least writing for my own wiki there are no deadlines, no wracking the brain for various topics that appeal to a larger crowd (I can concentrate on the niche security/sysadmin stuff that I enjoy), so it should be a little more relaxed and hobby-ish, rather than feeling like "real work".&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="nagios"></category></entry><entry><title>Two-factor SSH authentication via Google secures Linux logins</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/two-factor-ssh-authentication-via-google-secures-linux-logins.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-25T08:35:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-06-25T08:35:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2011-06-25:/blog/two-factor-ssh-authentication-via-google-secures-linux-logins.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's TechMail was &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/two-factor-ssh-authentication-via-google-secures-linux-logins/2607"&gt;Two-factor SSH authentication via Google secures Linux logins&lt;/a&gt; which talks about using Google two-factor authentication with SSH (and PAM in general).

&lt;p&gt;Two-factor authentication turns off a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of people because they think it's too hard but it honestly isn't, and the security benefits it provides are outstanding.  Two-factor authentication operates on two principles or components for an authentication "token" (or password for lack of a better term): one thing you know (your password) and one thing you don't (a random time-based PIN that a hardware device generates for you).  This means that if someone has my username and password, that information is utterly &lt;i&gt;useless&lt;/i&gt; without having my hardware token (which can be, in the case of Google, an iPhone or Android phone, etc.).  Which makes my account really quite secure, and certainly more secure than it would be with just a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sincerely care about your Google Apps security, you really owe it to yourself to check out the two-factor authentication support.  It's easy to setup, cheap to setup, and easy to use as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Two SSH clients to consider for the iPad</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/two-ssh-clients-to-consider-for-the-ipad.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-05-25T14:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-05-25T14:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2011-05-25:/blog/two-ssh-clients-to-consider-for-the-ipad.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's mac tip is &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/mac/two-ssh-clients-to-consider-for-the-ipad/1170"&gt;Two SSH clients to consider for the iPad&lt;/a&gt;.

Want to default deny access to files, and allow only trusted applications to access them?  No problem.  Hands Off! lets you grant access to specific files, or specific directories so that, for instance, a hack in Safari can't automatically send (or write) files outside of what Safari should have access to: cookies, local storage, cache, etc.  Hands Off! is pretty slick and worth looking at; the tip discusses it in further details.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="firewall"></category></entry><entry><title>Hack the D-Link DNS-323 to get an array of Linux server options</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/hack-the-d-link-dns-323-to-get-an-array-of-linux-server-options.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-04-23T20:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2011-04-23T20:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2011-04-23:/blog/hack-the-d-link-dns-323-to-get-an-array-of-linux-server-options.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's techmail was &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/hack-the-d-link-dns-323-to-get-an-array-of-linux-server-options/2423"&gt;Hack the D-Link DNS-323 to get an array of Linux server options&lt;/a&gt;.

I've got a few computers here, and my mom has one with more space than she knows what to do with, so setting up CrashPlan on three computers here and one remotely, I can use CrashPlan for free, which is great.  Another bonus is CrashPlan is cross-platform, so I can run it on the two macs here, the mac at my mom's, and the Fedora 14 workstation I'm running here as well.  Works amazingly well, even considering that the mac in the kitchen and the one at my mom's place aren't constantly running like the other two are.

This little gem is making me rethink my recommendations of using Shorewall because it's easier to configure and much more straightforward when it comes to defining the firewall rules.  It may be lacking in some feature areas that Shorewall has, but I've not found anything lacking in it yet.

I guess when you're doing something you love, with amazing people you respect and enjoy working with, time has no real bearing on anything.  When I first started working for Linux-Mandrake (now Mandriva) back in 2000, I got Tux inked on the back of one leg.  Tux is fairly generic and represented the beginning of my journey with Linux (well, the beginning of my paid journey anyways!).  Tux is also much cooler to tattoo than the (sorry, but it's true) silly top hat and magic wand that was the logo for Linux-Mandrake back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadowman, on the other hand, is timeless and just plain cool.  If Red Hat turned into Yellow Hat or Purple Frog tomorrow, I think they'd be hard pressed to develop an icon like Shadowman.  And I've wanted Shadowman tattooed on the other leg for about a year now (my daughter is also very much enamoured with Shadowman and told me that he would make an extremely cool tattoo.. and I agree).  So yesterday the deed was done.  Probably the fastest tattoo I've ever gotten, and the greatest skin grinder to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagios is one of my favourite things to tinker with, and using NRPE is a bit nicer than using the check_by_ssh plugin that I used to use.  I don't really care if the load average or memory usage is sniffed, so using NRPE is nice and easy (and removes the hassles of key-based auth for SSH, seeing all those SSH connections show up in logwatch reports, etc.).  If you have the ability to install NRPE on a remote system to monitor, it's worth trying out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>Easily distracted?

Mac tools that keep you focused&lt;/a&gt;.  This was an interesting tip to write because when you sit in front of the computer all day, it's sometimes hard to quantify how much productive work you get done.  Like now, updating my blog, for instance.  =)  If you're in front of the computer for 14hrs a day, how many of those are productive hours?  How many are wasted time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tool that I looked at was called Concentrate, which sets you up with a fully customizable "work session".  When I first saw Concentrate I thought it was kind of gimicky, but I've come to appreciate how it lets me, easily, shove stuff out of the way and only pull up the things I need.  Having a timer handy ensures that I can work for a set amount of time and gives me a sense of actually concentrating and getting things done.  The other is a web service called Rescue Time and it's quite interesting to see the stats on yourself.  My boss will be happy to know that this week I am in the top 16% of Rescue Time people, with an efficiency summary score of 1.12 vs the average of 0.4.  That actually seems to be pretty consistent, which is somewhat scary (for the average person).  It also shows me that the bulk of my time is spent in the Terminal each week (the highest used application).  There is proof that I'm a CLI junkie.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="gtd"></category></entry><entry><title>My adventure upgrading RHEL5 to RHEL6</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/my-adventure-upgrading-rhel5-to-rhel6.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-23T19:42:00-07:00</published><updated>2011-02-23T19:42:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2011-02-23:/blog/my-adventure-upgrading-rhel5-to-rhel6.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've begun the migration and probably picked the hardest machine to start with.

One of my goals here was to do a clean migration from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 box to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 box for a specific set of services, and to intentionally have SELinux in enforcing mode (I'm determined to no longer be intimidated by SELinux).  The machine in question is probably one of the most important in my home network: it handles DHCP, DNS, LDAP, and Kerberos for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHEL6 is amazing, but the migration was.. painful.  But I take full responsibility for that pain... if I had read the migration guide (or even pertinent parts of it), I could have saved myself two long nights.  Oh well, live and learn.  The other goal was to not copy any existing configs over, but to re-edit new configs (some of these configs hail from Annvix, some from Mandriva Corporate Server... it was due a cleaning and updating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS was easy enough, and DHCP was a piece of cake.  Kerberos was pretty good, but moving from Kerberos 1.6 to 1.8 had one interesting gotchya.  I had to work around Kerberized NFS previously due to a 1.8-based client talking to a 1.6-based server and it seems that a similar work-around was required for the server (note this is the KDC, it doesn't export anything for NFS).  I needed to add to /etc/krb5.conf in the [libdefaults] section, the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 # for NFS
 allow_weak_crypto = true
 default_tgs_enctypes = des-cbc-crc
 default_tkt_enctypes = des-cbc-crc
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that was done, Kerberos worked just as well as before and, more importantly, I wasn't seeing any problems in my krb5kdc.log when my Fedora 14 box was trying to get a ticket.  For Google's sake, the log entry looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Feb 23 17:33:20 kerberos.example.com krb5kdc[1679](info): TGS_REQ
(7 etypes {18 17 16 23 3 1 2}) 192.168.250.52: BAD_ENCRYPTION_TYPE:
authtime 0,  vdanen@EXAMPLE.COM for nfs/nfsserver.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM,
KDC has no support for encryption type
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LDAP was a severe PITA for me though.  There were a few challenges.  For one, it completely ignores /etc/openldap/slapd.conf now.  If I would have read &lt;a href="http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Migration_Planning_Guide/ch07s03.html"&gt;the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Migration Planning Guide&lt;/a&gt; I would have known this.  Sadly I chased my tail for two nights trying to figure out why TLS wasn't working at all (I could do an ldapsearch against the directory with -Z, but tossing in -ZZ always crapped out).  Eventually, I did get it working once I realized what was going on.  The big thing here is, if you have an existing slapd.conf you plan to migrate, you need to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# rm -rf /etc/openldap/slapd.d; mkdir /etc/openldap/slapd.d
# slaptest -f /etc/openldap/slapd.conf -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d
# chown -R ldap:ldap /etc/openldap/slapd.d/
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could remove the slapd.conf, but I since I find it nice and easy and comfortable, I've kept it (realizing that it's a template only, of sorts).  Also keep in mind that if your LDAP server is, for example, ldap.foo.com, you better darn well make sure the CN in the SSL certificate matches, or SSSD will be &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; unhappy with you.  I didn't realize this before (although before I don't believe I had enabled TLS (primarily because SSSD doesn't enforce TLS when doing NSS lookups, by the looks of things, but only when requesting authentication information (or sending it, as the case may be)).  It doesn't matter much to nss_ldap (where you can tell it to not use SSL/TLS), but it sure matters a lot to SSSD (which I didn't pay much attention to before because kerberos is handling the auth, not LDAP).  That drove me bonkers for a bit (SSSD, or whatever it's talking to, needs to be a little more helpful the error messages!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other gotchyas were that only gpg2 is available now, which played havoc with my AIDE+gpg scripts.  That was a simple fix, once I figured it out (the problem is that gpg-agent is pretty much mandatory, and pinentry doesn't seem to work too well if you don't have a GUI and are su -'d to another user).  Thankfully, I could work around this quite painlessly in my scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a good brain flex.  Frustrating as all get out, but now that it's working, I'm happy.  The next box is the internal intranet with kerberized apache, NFSv4 kerberized exports, nagios server, and internal subversion server.  I think I'll wait for the weekend on that one though.  I don't think it will be as painful as this box, but there will be a lot of SELinux policy tweaking on that one if I want to run it in enforcing mode.  I've also been mucking with this since Saturday, and feel like doing something a little less taxing for the rest of my evening.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="rhel"></category><category term="kerberos"></category><category term="ldap"></category></entry><entry><title>AIDE+gpg 1.0.2 released</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/aidegpg-1-0-2-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-23T17:57:00-07:00</published><updated>2011-02-23T17:57:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2011-02-23:/blog/aidegpg-1-0-2-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of my work migrating to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, I found that AIDE+gpg does not work with GnuPG2 (previously, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Annvix only used GnuPG version 1).

It also setups a cron job to check the database against the system daily to alert you of any changes.

&lt;p&gt;Just going to quote one part of it, which is the most amusing part, although the whole thing is worth reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"?&lt;/b&gt;

BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone.

Your son may try to install "lunix" on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional.

If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface.

It's been running since last night (I don't know the specific time it started, but it has to be well over 10hrs ago) and it's still in the "remove old package records" stage.  That seems highly excessive to me.&lt;/p&gt;

   File records : 9554598          Source records  : 76031          
   Ctags records: 56300434         Requires records: 100345
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what it is doing is first removing all of the old records (packages, files, ctags, requires, source files) before it can add in the new.  Of course, it does this one at a time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
if self.type == 'source':
  tables = ('packages', 'sources', 'files', 'ctags', 'buildreqs')
for rnum in to_remove:
  r_count = r_count + 1
  for table in tables:
    query  = "DELETE FROM %s WHERE p_record = %d" % (table, rnum)
    result = self.db.do_query(query)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the problem is I've reached my limit of understanding of efficient MySQL as I've never dealt with data sets this huge.  What would be the best way to handle this?  Would using temporary tables work best?  Would having each rpm repo on its own table work better?  That would logistically be more work as I'd have to create SQL tables on the fly (and while I would like this thing to be portable between db types at some point, it currently isn't -- but this would have an impact when I want to make it portable).  The problem then is if I want to query and look for 'sshd.c' for instance, I'd have to look across multiple tables (such as 'rqs_f14_source' and 'rqs_rhel6_source' instead of just 'source'), but my concern is that might increase the query time (querying right now is pretty fast, and I don't want to negatively impact querying times, but this import/update time now is ridiculous).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe that is the answer?  Multiple tables, grouped by repo (or tag, as rq calls them) as opposed to giant tables now?  I mean, looking at the number of rows in the ctags table (56,300,434), this is a pretty huge dataset.  Or can you remove from multiple tables at the same time (the p_record column is identical across tables... same name, same data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any hints to speed this sucker up?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="rpm"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Mac App Store pros and cons: What it means for developers and users</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/mac-app-store-pros-and-cons-what-it-means-for-developers-and-users.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-20T14:14:00-07:00</published><updated>2011-01-20T14:14:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2011-01-20:/blog/mac-app-store-pros-and-cons-what-it-means-for-developers-and-users.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's mac techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/mac/?p=957"&gt;Mac App Store pros and cons: What it means for developers and users&lt;/a&gt;.

Out of all the streaming server options for the mac that I've found, Playback is the easiest to get up and running and the one that works most reliably from the consoles.  Very highly recommended.  I know there are other alternatives, like the multi-platform PS3 Media Server, but that one at least I found to be fairly convoluted and took too much time to get it working properly (mind you, it was a while ago so perhaps things have changed since then).  PS3 Media Server also only unofficially supports the XBOX 360, whereas Playback supports PS3 and XBOX 360, out of the box, easily.  Playback had me up and streaming in minutes with minimal configuration, which is exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>Set up easy file sharing with NFS on Linux</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/set-up-easy-file-sharing-with-nfs-on-linux.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-26T15:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-10-26T15:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2010-10-26:/blog/set-up-easy-file-sharing-with-nfs-on-linux.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1939"&gt;Set up easy file sharing with NFS on Linux&lt;/a&gt; which is a quick primer on getting NFS setup quickly on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="nfs"></category></entry><entry><title>How to set up an OS X OpenVPN client</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/how-to-set-up-an-os-x-openvpn-client.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-26T12:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-10-26T12:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2010-10-26:/blog/how-to-set-up-an-os-x-openvpn-client.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's mac techmail was &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/mac/?p=783"&gt;How to set up an OS X OpenVPN client&lt;/a&gt; which looks at using the fantastic Shimo VPN client program to setup a client endpoint to an OpenVPN-based VPN (using certificates).

&lt;p&gt;Then I realized I harped on CERT not too long ago about not doing things right.  =)  Granted, my key hasn't been compromised and I have no established schedule for rotating keys, but 6 years is a long time.  So I've generated a new key, and revoked the old key.  Direct link to the new key/revocation certificate: &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/vdanen.asc"&gt;http://linsec.ca/vdanen.asc"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been signed with my old key and a few others.  If anyone out there has signed my old key (0xFEE30AD4), I would surely appreciate you signing the new key as well.  I think a trail of trust has been established with the new key.  The particulars:&lt;/p&gt;

It is ridiculous that an organization supposedly as secure as &lt;a href="http://www.cert.org/"&gt;CERT&lt;/a&gt; can have such poor distribution mechanisms for alerting users of their new GPG keys.  It is really important that, when you update GPG keys and distribute the public key that you can &lt;i&gt;easily&lt;/i&gt; establish trust of the new key.  There are a few ways this can be done: sign the new key with the old (known and/or trusted) key, sign any distribution mails with the old key (to ensure authenticity), include a revocation in the new key to import, and have a secure place where that information can be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CERT changes keys often -- way more often than their once-a-year policy on their web site indicates; well, this year they have anyways.  Previous years were one key a year.  However, they don't follow any of these "best practices".  And they know it, because I've told them in the past.  And yet, even now, they still can't get it right.  What's more amusing is that on their &lt;a href="https://www.cert.org/contact_cert/encryptmail.html"&gt;Sending Sensitive Information to CERT&lt;/a&gt; page, which is SSL encrypted, shows &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; different fingerprints.

&lt;p&gt;The wrong fingerprint listed in section #2 belongs to the old key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key released today is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
pub   2048R/72C33BD5 2010-09-13 [expires: 2011-09-30]
      Key fingerprint = 79DA 4C07 0AE5 EB20 D641  3F80 67B1 5F29 72C3 3BD5
uid                  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
sig 3        72C33BD5 2010-09-13  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the previous key is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
pub   2048R/9A478CA0 2010-03-03 [revoked: 2010-09-13]
      Key fingerprint = E9EA E7FB D8AF E5AE FD36  41DE 5146 432C 9A47 8CA0
rev          9A478CA0 2010-09-13  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
uid                  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
sig 3        9A478CA0 2010-03-03  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how things are getting sloppy, we need to go back a bit further to see what had been done in the past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
pub   2048R/B7FBBBC1 2010-01-20 [revoked: 2010-03-03]
      Key fingerprint = 66A6 DAC9 3014 21CB DCA6  A6F6 3389 F064 B7FB BBC1
rev          B7FBBBC1 2010-03-03  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
uid                  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
sig 3        B7FBBBC1 2010-01-20  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
sig          AF30D800 2010-01-20  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the difference here?  This third-latest key was signed by another CERT-owned key (AF30D800), which was the previous-to-that key used.  Trust is then established to the new key, &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; the old (known) key.  The most current and previous keys were not signed by their predecessors, which makes them harder to trust.  So in the last three keys, two are self-signed, one is properly signed to establish trust (by the previous key).  What's even more sad is that key AF30D800 was nicely signed: not only by the previous key, but also by a "master key" which also establishes more authenticity of the key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
pub   2048R/AF30D800 2009-06-15 [revoked: 2010-01-20]
      Key fingerprint = 943C 0A2E 4CB8 4C8F CA53  22F8 680D 4DC1 AF30 D800
rev          AF30D800 2010-01-20  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
uid                  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;

sig          14C33F57 2009-06-15  CERT Coordination Center &lt;cert@cert.org&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this one is a good key, a trustable key.  The last two keys are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple that with the half-updated web page and you're left scratching your head -- or, at least, I was.  Not so much this time because, sadly, I'm no longer surprised.  But last time I actually phoned CERT to verify the new key's fingerprint because I had nothing to trust it with.  In fact, when the mail came out to notify of the new key, it was signed with the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; key, not the old key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm... excuse me, but I can spoof sending a mail from cert@cert.org and generate my own key with the uid cert@cert.org and bloody well sign it with the spoofed key I just generated!  The only thing I couldn't do is update their web page but, honestly, I wonder how many people check.  And of those that do, have they done it in the past and noticed prior inconsistencies and just chalked it up to... incompetence?  Negligence?  Key distribution malpractice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there is nothing for me to trust that this new key is legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's sad that an organization built around &lt;i&gt;security&lt;/i&gt; has no clue about this.  What's worse, is they've been told (twice!) about a better way to distribute new keys.  I know.  I told them.  Both times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to recap, these are things you &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; do when distributing a new GPG key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sign the email sending out the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; key with the &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt; key.  Seriously, it establishes trust and proves you are who you say you are
&lt;li&gt; Fully and completely update your web site.  It's nice you have one, and it's nice that it's semi-updated, and even better that you can get to it via SSL.  But if it lists the new key in section 1 and section 2 is about verifying the fingerprint but lists the &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt; key's fingerprint, how do you trust any of it?
&lt;li&gt; Sign the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; key with the &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt; key.  It proves that the person/organization who has the old key trusts the new one enough to sign it.  Like giving it a seal of approval or just saying "hey, this is legit"
&lt;li&gt; For Pete's sake, revoke the old key!  It doesn't have to necessarily be in the same message, but it should be revoked.  Heck, send out a mail signed with the old key, containing the new key, and then send out another message signed with the new key, revoking the old key.  Or have one email message sending two different GPG-signed sections so one email does it all.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is difficult to do, and it makes trusting these new keys so much easier.  I've not paid attention to see if other people/organizations fail so badly here, but I don't get what makes this so hard to do.  It's not rocket science, just common sense.  I can see Joe Average maybe not thinking about it, but for an organization like CERT?  Come on.  How are we supposed to trust what you send out when you can't even get Simple Key Management 101 right?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="gpg"></category></entry><entry><title>Reusable passwords</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/reusable-passwords.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-09-13T12:50:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-09-13T12:50:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2010-09-13:/blog/reusable-passwords.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And this is why I have randomly generated passwords on all sites and services...  this is funny, but sadly way too true.&lt;/p&gt;

I love this tool; with it I can have the important data on my laptop encrypted with AES-256 encryption (military-grade) such as email so that if the laptop is every stolen, and if they manage to get to the contents of the hard drive (trivial if they have physical access) they still can't get to the important encrypted data.  As an aside, there is a &lt;a href="http://www.mupromo.com/"&gt;MacUpdate promo bundle&lt;/a&gt; right now that includes Espionage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there still seems to be some issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Cloning into bare repository /cvs-scratch/fedora/opensc/fedpkg.git...
open log failed: Permission denied
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
Could not clone: Command '['git', 'clone', '--bare', 'ssh://me@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/opensc', '/cvs-scratch/fedora/opensc/fedpkg.git']' returned non-zero exit status 128
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what this means.  But the old CVS repository doesn't seem to be usable either, which kinda stinks.  I'm sure it's just a minor buglet or two and will get worked out eventually.  Very very happy that we're no longer using CVS for this... I'd prefer SVN myself, but git is ok too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="git"></category></entry><entry><title>Clear some desk space with cross-platform keyboard and mouse sharing app</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/clear-some-desk-space-with-cross-platform-keyboard-and-mouse-sharing-app.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-27T14:16:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-07-27T14:16:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2010-07-27:/blog/clear-some-desk-space-with-cross-platform-keyboard-and-mouse-sharing-app.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1696"&gt;Clear some desk space with cross-platform keyboard and mouse sharing app&lt;/a&gt;.

I've been using Komodo for years, and even though it is pay-to-play, it's still my favourite IDE.  In particular, I really like the fact that it has support for so many languages... I used to be a pretty big fan of Zend Studio, until they moved it over to Eclipse.  Then I went back to Komodo.  Of course, now that I'm doing more in python than PHP, I would have been using Komodo more anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tip looks at things like customizing the toolbox to get more snippets and commands in there (i.e. running pylint on the currently open file), looks at debugging support, changing the keybindings (need my vim keybindings!), and some of the add-ons you can install (since Komodo is based on Mozilla code, it is capable of using addons, just like Firefox or Thunderbird).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="komodo"></category></entry><entry><title>Increase download speed with Aria2 utility</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/increase-download-speed-with-aria2-utility.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-30T09:18:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-06-30T09:18:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2010-06-30:/blog/increase-download-speed-with-aria2-utility.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's techmail was &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1622"&gt;Increase download speed with Aria2 utility&lt;/a&gt; which looks at an incredibly useful and cool file download client.

It's got a Core i7 quad CPU (Q9300), 8GB RAM, and dual boots Windows 7 and Fedora 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear lazyweb, how can I make this system as quite on Fedora as it is on Windows?  It's absolutely silent when Win7 is running, but when Fedora is running the fans are quite noisy.  Most of the time the system has a load average of 0.00 so it isn't CPU spiking causing the fans to go full-bore.  For temperatures I have Core0 at about 51C and Core1 at 44C and the other two cores at 48C, but the fans are running at 1583 and 1160 rpm.  I can't get the sensors to pick up temps or fan speeds on Win7 for some reason so don't have a basis for comparison (tried a few of those "gadgets" and none show me temperatures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has to be a way to lower the fan speed on Fedora but I can't find it.  I tried fancontrol from lm_sensors but it complains about not being able to manually set the fans and there's nothing I can see in the BIOS that's even remotely relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I doomed to a noisy Fedora box?  Or is there a way I can make this thing quieter short of buying new fans?  (The latter is an option I suppose, but if Win7 can run perfectly silent, then I'm of the frame of mind that Fedora should too).  Running an up to date F13 (wheeee!!).

It would be nice if the iPhone offered better encryption so it wasn't so easy to work around if you have a computer to hook it up to, but having something a little stronger than a four-digit pin, to me, is a half-step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>Set up Dropbox on a GUI-less Linux server</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/755.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-23T08:18:00-06:00</published><updated>2010-05-23T08:18:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2010-05-23:/blog/755.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's techmail was &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1545"&gt;Set up Dropbox on a GUI-less Linux server&lt;/a&gt; which takes you through the necessary steps of setting up Dropbox on a GUI-less Linux box.

I use Dropbox here for keeping certain files in sync between systems, but I also am connected to a secondary Dropbox to act as a remote backup for a long-standing client of mine.  It works great; they have two systems that share data (encrypted disk images), and I've also had to run a second copy of Dropbox on my system here to keep a copy of that data, but I was then rsyncing it to my remote backup server as well.  With this, I can skip my system at home as being the "middle man" and get that remote backup server (headless CentOS 5) linked to the Dropbox instead.  Saves bandwidth and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who uses runit, the following is a script to supervise dropboxd as a specific user.  With runit I can connect to as many independent Dropbox accounts as I like, running each under a specific user.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a neat way of controlling your system when you're not home in a pinch.

It's something you'd only really need to use once, but it works really well.  And with the ability to upload mbox and maildir format mails as well (instead of just old Apple Mail, Thunderbird, Entourage, etc. email), you can use a tool like offlineimap to suck down old mails to a maildir, then turn around and upload them back to Google Apps.

It's a very small set of packages so I don't feel too awful about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, one of my favourite features in Annvix was being able to run the entire system out of runit (Annvix used runit in place of SysVinit).  This gave us nicely supervised services using runit (much like DJB's daemontools).  Feeling crappy with the first day of a head cold, I spent some time today over lunch to get runit working with RHEL5.  I had to re-tool the package since I don't want it to replace SysVinit, but run under init and just supervise services (like sshd, exim, etc. -- call me weird, but runit/daemontools makes a fantastic watchdog and with sshd running from tcpsvd, I get some nice ACLs to use as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, runit now installs and works properly.  Sorry to anyone who wanted to use it (I've been meaning to do this for the last year, ever since I switched all of my servers over to CentOS).  The runit package also comes with a bunch of run scripts; I've not tested them all yet so if you do end up using it and have issues, let me know.  I did have to fix a few minor things in a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I've chkconfig'd off a few services and have them running supervised now:&lt;/p&gt;

It's essentially a polished front-end for FUSE with sshfs support for the SFTP/SSH connections.  It's a really great tool and while not free, it's relatively inexpensive and works wonders.  With it I can remotely mount the filesystem of my VPS using SSH with keys, or connect to the home filesystem while on the road, etc.  And instead of having to navigate the remote filesystem within one application like a traditional FTP client, I can access it using the terminal, Finder, PathFinder, or any other utility that operates on the local filesystem.

If you have a mac and you don't have 1Password, you're doing yourself a huge disservice.  1Password stores passwords (browsers, database, SSH logins, etc.), serial numbers, and notes in an encrypted keychain format.  It has plugins for the mac browsers that let's you autofill password information in sites meaning you have one place to store your passwords and they are accessible from all browsers (and you can add new login info from any browser).  To make it even better, you can sync the 1Password keychain using Dropbox or whatever so the same keychain can be used on different systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the absolute best password management app I've ever laid eyes on.  The companion iPhone/iPod Touch app is icing on the cake.

This plugin adds a bunch of features that should have been in Safari to begin with as far as I'm concerned: automatic re-opening of tabs when you start Safari, auto-closing the download window... it also adds some extras for searching; with Glims you can customize your search box to build pre-defined queries of other sites or create shortcuts to sites, etc.  I used to use Saft for this, but every time there is a new version of Safari, it seems like Saft trails a few days holding you back from upgrading (or losing the functionality it provides), and Saft isn't free.  Glims is free and provides almost all of the functionality that Saft does.  Definitely a worth-while addon for the Safari browser.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>iPass on the Apple iPad: It's no netbook killer</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/ipass-on-the-apple-ipad-its-no-netbook-killer.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-02T21:36:00-07:00</published><updated>2010-02-02T21:36:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2010-02-02:/blog/ipass-on-the-apple-ipad-its-no-netbook-killer.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's mac techmail is completely non-technical and is a bit of an opinion/rant piece: &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/mac/?p=332"&gt;iPass on the Apple iPad: It's no netbook killer&lt;/a&gt; and it pretty much sums up my feeling about the much-touted iPad.

Unfortunately, it converted one Maildir to another.  =(  One crucial piece is missing, so here is the one-liner in all its glory:&lt;/p&gt;

$ mutt -f Archive/ -e 'set mbox_type=mbox; set confirmcreate=no; \

I've got a few pfSense firewalls out there for companies I've consulted for and being able to (securely) remotely administrate it, and all the cool add-ons and plugins you can stick in this thing make it absolutely wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daylite is one of my most-used programs that I've been using for years on the mac.  I absolutely love it.  It gets me my contacts and calendar, and other assorted goodies, on my desktop, my laptop, and my iPhone.  Multi-user, networked, allowing for offline databases that sync back to the online database... it's expensive, but it's pure goodness.  Sure, it's had it's fair share of issues and I've had one catastrophe with it a few years ago, but I love it and use it daily.

I've got Vista on one drive, and Fedora 12 on the other (Vista is around for gaming and that's about it).  So I decided to go through the steps of the Win7 upgrade.  Well.. the HP assistant stuff was ok.  Trying to upgrade Win7 though resulted in this error: "Windows Setup cannot find a location to store temporary installation files.  To install Windows, make sure that a partition on your boot disk has at least 938 megabytes (MB) of free space."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After booting into &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/331796"&gt;Clean Boot&lt;/a&gt; mode, same error.  My Vista drive has 1TB of space, with about 800GB free.  But... my boot drive is the other TB drive with Fedora 12 on it, and obviously Windows can't write to it.  Seems a little brain-dead that Windows wouldn't write temporary files to &lt;em&gt;it's&lt;/em&gt; primary drive, doesn't it?  Going into the BIOS to change the boot drive from Fedora to Windows did the trick.  Isn't this OS supposed to be intelligent though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise the upgrade was uneventful... mind you, the only apps I have installed are NWN2, D&amp;amp;D Online, Firefox, and Cygwin so I guess there's not a lot to mess up in there.  Pretty uneventful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it totally looks like Vista.  I guess the visual enhancements must be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; subtle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Snoop on your own network with ntop</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/snoop-on-your-own-network-with-ntop.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-10T13:38:00-07:00</published><updated>2009-11-10T13:38:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-11-10:/blog/snoop-on-your-own-network-with-ntop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1042"&gt;Snoop on your own network with ntop&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses the many uses for the ntop application and why you want to use it, particularly if you need to keep an eye on your network traffic and throughput.  ntop is a great analysis tool that deserves a …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=1042"&gt;Snoop on your own network with ntop&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses the many uses for the ntop application and why you want to use it, particularly if you need to keep an eye on your network traffic and throughput.  ntop is a great analysis tool that deserves a place in any sysadmin's arsenal of tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>Get creative with Automator workflows in Mac</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/get-creative-with-automator-workflows-in-mac.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-10T13:18:00-07:00</published><updated>2009-11-10T13:18:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-11-10:/blog/get-creative-with-automator-workflows-in-mac.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's mac techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/mac/?p=197"&gt;Get creative with Automator workflows in Mac&lt;/a&gt; which discusses some of the new Automator-related features of OS X 10.6, particularly in regards to the new Services menu and easy-to-get-started Automator templates.

&lt;p&gt;Oh, for anyone interested in seeing some stats, my &lt;a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/429927"&gt;profile page on nanowrimo.org&lt;/a&gt; has my word counts as I update them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>NaNoWriMo: take two</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/nanowrimo-take-two.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-10-31T11:49:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-10-31T11:49:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-10-31:/blog/nanowrimo-take-two.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So last year I participated in &lt;a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/"&gt;National Novel Writing Month&lt;/a&gt; but didn't pull it off.

The idea is to go nuts and write a 50k word novel during the month of November.  People all around the world do it, and it's quite fun but very time consuming and pretty crazy.  Last year there was too much going on for me to really focus, so I think I hit about 20k words.  Not quite an epic fail, but not nearly what I had set out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I'm at it again.  I've got some vague ideas as to what to write about and it should be fun.  I'm definitely aiming for 50k words this month so stuff like blogging and other "extra-curicular" activities will be on hold this month while I churn out a novel (or something vaguely resembling one).&lt;/p&gt;

I'm quite certain all my friends would think it silly.  Heck, I'd have more luck getting people to my place if I threw a Partylite candle party!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the whole thing is highly amusing.  First, you have to look at the videos.  These are priceless.  I must know how much you get paid to look so dang happy showing people the marvels of an innovative "search" feature.  Seriously, you need to check these out.  I can't say they're good for a laugh... they're not.  But they're certainly bewildering and bewitching... like... well, nothing comes to mind.  But don't watch the introductory video (well, if you must, go for it)... it's long and I was almost crying by the end of it.  Yeah, it's that bad.  Here it is: &lt;a href="http://www.houseparty.com/offers/windows7usa/hosthelpvideos"&gt;Windows 7 house party host help videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I post this isn't to necessarily mock Microsoft.  They're doing a fine job of that themselves.  But I wanted to point out an absolutely brilliant piece of journalism that was written because of these videos and is extremely amusing.  (Thanks Maurice for posting the link on the ELUG list!).  &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/28/charlie-brooker-microsoft-mac-windows"&gt;Microsoft's grinning robots or the Brotherhood of the Mac. Which is worse?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll forgive you if you don't watch the videos.  Only a morbid fascination had me watch three of them (and by then it was just so patently ridiculous I couldn't justify spending another moment watching more), but this article is pure genius.

Yesterday the contractor we hired finally finished putting up new insulation and vinyl siding on the house, and I have to admit he did a fantastic job and it looks bloody sharp.  Pics to come (the eavestrough isn't up yet, a different sub-contracted company does that, so the house looks a bit weird without it, hence no pictures yet).  Oh, and I painted the front door red.  Somewhat strange, but my wife likes it and oddly enough it does look pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to put my cat to sleep last week.  Tika, who was 17, was down to 4.5lbs (down from 7.5lbs in May, and about 14 or 15lbs a year ago).  Not sure what was wrong with her, but she wasn't eating, was suffering from muscle weakness (started falling when she walked and sliding off the couch when she slept).  If she was in pain, she kept it to herself.  Instead of trying to do diagnostics and all kinds of (expensive) treatment, we opted to just put her down.  I think that was for the best; I honestly don't think she would have lasted the week and my daughter was quite upset about her falling and stuff, so although it sucked horribly, it was the best thing to do.  That was my Tuesday last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Friday we got a new Maine Coon kitty who is completely white with a grey smudge on the top of his head.  Feisty little turkey.  His name is Sammy and he's 2mos old and a complete nutjob.  But he really likes my daughter and likes to cuddle and most importantly he's taken our mind of the loss of Tika.  His paws are &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; though... he's going to be one big cat for sure.  Today he and Pepper started wrestling without growls.. definitely a good sign.  Pics of him will come soon enough (he's exceptionally cute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my father is currently in Malaysia getting married.  That'll sure make things different as well when they get back.&lt;/p&gt;

This week Apple wrecked it by making Kerberos an absolute nuisance.  It wasn't bad in OS X 10.5.. a bit annoying to setup but the tools were adequate.  In 10.6 they threw away the half-decent GUI and gave us a crap dummied-up GUI which means whenever I need to kinit, I have to open a Terminal.  More importantly, whenever my &lt;em&gt;wife&lt;/em&gt; has to kinit, &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; has to open a Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a big thing for me as Terminal is always open... but for her?  She's never opened it once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple... what were you thinking?  Kerberos is an absolute PITA now and not nearly as convenient as it could/should be.  Certainly nothing like Kerberos support on my Fedora workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's plenty to like about Snow Leopard, but when I went through the effort of getting Kerberos working last month, using it on the mac was a joy.  Now?  Well... all those companies and schools that use kerberos are really going to be thinking twice about upgrading until this gets worked out or someone writes a good app to handle it.  I mean, really... how hard is it to have something in the menu bar that you can click on to renew your ticket or get one in the first place?  Not so hard (well, for me it would be, but not for someone who knows how to write these little apps).  I'm also &lt;a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20090826171748770"&gt;not the only person to feel this way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

He wrote a blog post about &lt;a href="http://dodonov.net/blog/2009/09/02/msec-future-and-plans/"&gt;msec's future and plans&lt;/a&gt; detailing the things he wants to do with msec in the future.  So he dropped me a line to see how I'd feel about making msec and rsec play nice together so there wouldn't necessarily be a need for both (since there is obviously some duplication of functionality, one being a fork of the other after all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think this might be a good move.  rsec is essentially a complete tool, but if we can swap in msec's plugin functionality for the reports and make it so that is can be a standalone component separate from msec (be it that msec drops the reporting capabilities and adopts a refreshed rsec as a dependency, or whether msec permits building just the reporting capabilities separate from the msec stuff), then I'm definitely game.  What might be interesting, however, is to see how msec and rsec can be merged with &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/sectool/"&gt;sectool&lt;/a&gt; in some way.  To be honest, I'd never heard of sectool until Eugeni mentioned it... it's a Fedora project so it might have a lot of Red Hat/Fedora-specific stuff in there, but if it is or could be more generalized to do what msec does as well as what rsec does, then maybe there's a place for one tool to take the place of three tools and have a broader usage base and become a better tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity here to build a better tool out of two, or maybe even three, tools is quite interesting and one of the things I love about open source.  Merging msec and rsec should be quite easy I think.  Merging with sectool might be more difficult, but I see a lot of crossover in what msec and sectool both do already -- there really is no reason to have a Mandriva-specific tool and a Fedora-specific tool that do the same thing.  I suspect sectool might be good at creating decent reports which may even obsolete the need for rsec.  Taking a closer look at sectool will help me determine if that is the case (and then it remains to be seen if there is a sectool build for EPEL or if it can be done since I'm currently using rsec on some Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and CentOS 5 systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, I smell some possibilities here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Mirroring Web sites with wget</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/mirroring-web-sites-with-wget.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-09-01T18:08:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-09-01T18:08:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-09-01:/blog/mirroring-web-sites-with-wget.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=883"&gt;Mirroring Web sites with wget&lt;/a&gt; which discusses using wget to mirror... websites!

It's been updated and is available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (and CentOS 5) as I think it's still a pretty good tool and complements stuff like logwatch quite nicely.  rsec essentially reports on various bits of your system... it lets you know if there are changes to suid/sgid files, points out unowned files, changes to firewall rules, indicates if there are new packages to install, if there are changes to listening services, etc.  Basically it took all the best bits (reporting) of msec and got rid of all the crappy bits (that change things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard that msec now is much better, but have not had a chance to try it although I do try to keep up with the changes to msec related to reporting and fold those back into rsec.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Pics from sessions 1, 2, and 3</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/pics-from-sessions-1-2-and-3.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-08-23T22:10:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-08-23T22:10:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-08-23:/blog/pics-from-sessions-1-2-and-3.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wulfheart/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; account now has pictures of my new in-progress sleeve.

Sessions 2 and 3 added color; session 2 was done this past Monday (the 17th of August) and took 6.5hrs, and session 3 was done yesterday (Saturday, the 22nd of August) and was 3.5hrs.  I think it looks pretty sharp.  I didn't get pics of just session 2's work, but that was mostly the vine creature and the dragon and the background on the lower forearm.  Session 3 was the nebula in the "ditch" (which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but it bruised &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;), finished off the dragon (the horns and eyes and some of the body), and also one missing bit on the inside wrist (I will tell you, the wrist is the worst).

So now half the tattoo itches like crazy, and part of it burns.  Tomorrow the new stuff shouldn't feel so tight anymore... then the itching will come.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to hopefully getting the rest of the lower forearm done this coming Saturday (would have done more yesterday except there was a big tattoo show in Edmonton this weekend so the arm rests were at the show so we did all we could without it, but since I'm not a contortionist there was quite a bit we couldn't do).  Then it's about 2 weeks off before doing some more work on the various nebula ideas we've got for the rest of the upper arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really impressed with the results.  I've found my permanent guy... if anyone in Edmonton is looking for a really really good tattoo artist, check out Jared at &lt;a href="http://www.crimsonempiretattoo.com"&gt;Crimson Empire&lt;/a&gt;.

What a great way to get system information on the road or whatever so you can keep a proactive eye on your system.

&lt;p&gt;Googling it showed &lt;a href="http://www.svnforum.org/2017/viewtopic.php?t=8009&amp;sid=7bd9dc113ea5ff181ebbeaa959ee5234" rel="nofollow"&gt;one other guy&lt;/a&gt; who had it and never had an answer to his question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistence is the codeword of the day, so I finally figured it out.  Seems that OS X does things a little wonky with kerberos.  A tutorial I read about using mod_auth_kerb indicated you had to use the hostname of the server, regardless of any virtualhost names (so my server name is hades, the virtualhost alias is svn; the made-up domain is, originally, example.com).  Safari kept popping up the authentication dialog whenever I tried accessing the repository, which is not at all what I wanted.  I had to ktadd a new principle (HTTP/svn.example.com) with the virtualhost alias (which the tutorial said &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do).  Then Safari started working, but svn bombed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in Fedora 11, none of this was a problem.  But here's the weird part: klist on F11 showed HTTP/hades.example.com (from subversion or firefox), whereas on OS X subversion crapped out and crashed and Safari showed HTTP/svn.example.com.  So I decided to see what firefox on OS X would do and it (properly) used HTTP/hades.example.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the weirdest part is that svn is working again!  Why?  For some reason (and I'm not quite sure whether I should be blaming OS X here or neon or a combination of the two), svn is not initiating obtaining a ticket for HTTP/hades.example.com.  I'm not sure why, because on F11 it did.  If I kdestroy and kinit (so I only have krbtgt's ticket), svn craps out.  However, once I used Firefox to obtain the ticket, svn could re-use it and all worked well.  If I remove the HTTP/svn.example.com principle on the server, svn still doesn't work and neither does Safari (I get the login dialog).  Obviously that's not my problem.  I'm wondering if these Collab binaries built for OS X are messed up somehow; I'll have to try from fink or build from source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was like pulling teeth tonight.  Definitely an interesting puzzle that I probably could have done without.  It'll be interesting to see if other svn builds on OS X do the same thing (of course, I could dispense with making svn use GSSAPI for this, but half the fun is seeing how many passwords I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; need).  At this point I have no real idea why svn even worked at all in the first place -- unless during the course of testing with Firefox I already had HTTP/hades.example.com's ticket.  Hmmm....&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="kerberos"></category></entry><entry><title>Kerberos fun</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/kerberos-fun.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-16T10:25:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-07-16T10:25:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-07-16:/blog/kerberos-fun.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This actually isn't a sarcastic title, for once.

I was put into a position to do some kerberos debugging for work, so had to re-setup a kerberos realm at home to do the testing.  Of course, at the time I also updated my &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/Using_Kerberos_5_for_Single_Sign-On_Authentication"&gt;Using Kerberos 5 for Single Sign-On Authentication&lt;/a&gt; which was a little out of date.  So I updated that to be relevant to RHEL rather than Annvix, and fixed a few bits that were out-dated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I did more poking around and figured out a few bits that were preventing me from actually using it years ago when I first setup a kerberos realm (didn't seem overly useful to me at the time).  I've got my OS X workstation kerberized which was... not as straight-forward as I would hope, but not awful (LDAP authentication from OpenLDAP is another matter entirely... still haven't nailed that yet).  So right now on my network I have my workstation, my server, and two vm's kerberized -- just for SSH now (which doesn't seem really amazing since I've been using SSH keys for years so no passwords, but this seems even more hands-off and will help with future vm deployments since it should all be out-of-the-box).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I've been poking around and found that you can hook Mediawiki up to LDAP/Kerberos for auth.  I never knew that.  All of a sudden this seems a lot cooler.  Oh, and subversion apparently works with kerberos (using mod_auth_kerb).  Then, the icing on the cake was to see a python-kerberos module which makes this &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too interesting to ignore since I've been doing some python coding recently and have really enjoyed it, and some future projects/ideas could really benefit from some kerberos love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, as I figure new bits out, I'll be updating my linsec.ca wiki article -- the info is out there but some of it isn't the easiest to grok.  Hopefully I can make it a bit more accessible/readable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="kerberos"></category></entry><entry><title>Towards responsible disclosure</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/towards-responsible-disclosure.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-09T18:11:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-07-09T18:11:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-07-09:/blog/towards-responsible-disclosure.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week was interesting, dealing with the supposed "OpenSSH 0day" vulnerability stuff... rumours, innuendo, strange logs and packet capture files... it made for a long week trying to keep an eye on this and sort fact from fiction.

Instead of focusing on the issue itself like other blogs and news sites are doing, I thought it might be interesting to look at some general resources to aid in the responsible disclosure of issues.  I won’t focus on whether or not this issue is fact, or fiction, or who caused it, who furthered it, who took advantage of it, or why it was done in the first place.  I'm more thinking of the fallout and the general panic it caused in a lot of people.  The problem with pegging OpenSSH as vulnerable is that it is a service used on most servers, and is a service that, more importantly, is perhaps one of the most &lt;em&gt;vital&lt;/em&gt; on servers.  As seen with one hosting company that preemptively shut SSH accessibility off entirely, a lot of people just couldn't get things done.  Other services, like DNS, are equally vital, so the fallout can be quite brutal -- even when something is not substantiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that makes this a problem today is the how fast information spreads, and how quickly something posted online is taken as gospel.  For instance, starting a rumour like this is extremely simple and can be done by one person with a bunch of email addresses and a little bit of knowledge.  This kind of social engineering can be used for a lot of things beyond just phishing (money, passwords, whatever).  It can be used to sow confusion, which could be used as a smoke-screen to cover other nefarious deeds and redirect attention from the truly nasty things going on, and it can also be used to perpetrate such fear that people are essentially causing a Denial of Service against themselves and/or their customers simply because of rumours spreading like wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, half the battle here is dealing with this stuff smarter and better, and more responsibly.  Outfits that claim inside information but aren't willing to share it are not being responsible.  I'm not saying to necessarily share it with the public at large (right away, at least), as that may not serve the public's best interest.  But to provide crucial information to affected vendors (who can then take that and develop fixes to help a much larger audience) or upstream is absolutely the responsible thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I'd like to share a few links that can help people disclose issues they are aware of, or suspect, in a more responsible fashion.  Holding info tight to your chest like a bag of sour gummies doesn't help anyone but you, and even then, it can harm more than help.  Individuals or companies that claim to have inside info and are working on a fix may not be the appropriate people to work on a fix in the first place.  After all, who knows code better than the folks who wrote it?  It makes more sense to take the issue and all the information you have and open up communication with the vendor/upstream in order to facilitate an appropriate fix that helps &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, not just yourself.  Quite often the fix you suggest is quite a ways from that which the vendor or upstream would use, and may cause more problems than it corrects.  So getting appropriate people involved just makes sense, and peer review is an asset that the open source community understands -- and views as necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are a few links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists"&gt;OSS Security wiki: Security-related mailing lists&lt;/a&gt; contains a list of mailing lists you can use to get in touch with people who care and sincerely want to help.  Many vendors are represented on both public and private lists, suitable for discussing issues that are currently public (oss-security) or those that are currently private (vendor-sec)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/whattodo"&gt;What to do if I encounter a security issue&lt;/a&gt; is a page that documents how to deal with a security or suspected security issue and how to make sure it gets to the right people
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/backporting/"&gt;Backporting of Security Fixes&lt;/a&gt;  talks about why many vendors, including Red Hat, backport fixes to packages rather than just updating to new ones (I'm including this because there was a lot of misinformation about OpenSSH versions being out-of-date and presumably insecure because they aren't the latest-and-greatest)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/security/team/contact/"&gt;Red Hat Security Contacts and Procedures&lt;/a&gt; is the contact page for the Red Hat Security Response Team; please use it if you think you have something as we absolutely want and love to help with this sort of stuff and if you don't know who to contact, chances are we can take care of that on your behalf
&lt;/li&gt;

Responsible disclosure is really important, and everyone needs to do their part when it comes to this stuff.  Irresponsible disclosure, or no disclosure, hurts more people than it helps and has been the source of many a headache for a whole lot of people over the years.</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="openssh"></category></entry><entry><title>Hacking Vim covers the basics and reveals tips for power users</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/hacking-vim-covers-the-basics-and-reveals-tips-for-power-users.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-08T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-07-08T13:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-07-08:/blog/hacking-vim-covers-the-basics-and-reveals-tips-for-power-users.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=727"&gt;Hacking Vim covers the basics and reveals tips for power users&lt;/a&gt;, which is a book review of "Hacking Vim" by Packt Publishing.

So making vim do the same thing was a piece of cake, and this tip shows you how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="vim"></category></entry><entry><title>Working from home</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/working-from-home.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-28T12:19:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-05-28T12:19:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-05-28:/blog/working-from-home.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Read an interesting piece on &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/"&gt;Lifehacker&lt;/a&gt; that pointed to an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/working-from-home-10-unconscious-cues-to-create-a-work-life-balance/"&gt;Working From Home: 10 Unconscious Cues to Create a Work-Life Balance&lt;/a&gt;.

Being a remote worker for Red Hat, and before that Mandriva, I've worked full-time at home for about 10 years now.  (Man, I feel old!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, there are 10 tips in the article and most of them I do in moderation... separation between "work" and "home" can be difficult sometimes because I hate leaving things undone, and there are opportunities aplenty to work longer hours... of course, the reality is that you're &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; done.  Ever.  At least not with what I'm doing... there's always something else to do... a new vulnerability to chase, scripts to update and/or tweak, patches to hunt down, you name it.  But, I've been getting better at the home/work separation and when I started with Red Hat I promised myself that more of that separation would be coming.  It has almost worked.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 10 tips, the hardest one for me is #1: Get Dressed.  Hmmm... I guess that means I shouldn't be working in my PJ's all the time.

But I like to think it's worth the few minutes of my time to write it, and it's something I've really noticed and I'd like to share my appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made it past my first 90 days at Red Hat and I sure am glad I made the transition.  You get wrapped up in one way of doing things, or dealing with people, or whatever, for long enough and when you get out of the comfort zone, things sure change.  Red Hat is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; different from Mandriva, so I've had 8 years of one way of working to overcome in the last 3mos.  I think I've tackled it pretty good, despite some frustrating moments.  In terms of infrastructure and how things work, and how people work with each other, it's so different I don't really have the words to express it.  So it's been quite the adjustment for me, and long hours, lots of learning, lots of note-taking, more than a few oopses, and a lot of patient people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say much about the Fedora side of things as I've not really had a chance to step into the Fedora community yet, although I hope to do something there in the next few months.  For now, I need to focus on the Red Hat side of things.. and I'm loving it.  Especially the people I get to work with... with an organization as large as Red Hat, it's no surprise that I'm running into new people all the time as my work takes me here, then there, and then waaay over there.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, everyone I've encountered has been stellar.  Not just in how smart and knowledgeable they are, but also in how they carry themselves and how downright helpful they are.  I really appreciate working with the Security Response Team (an absolutely fantastic bunch of guys that made me feel right at home from day one), and the developers I've had the occasion to work with, and the Quality Engineering folks are absolutely insane (in a good super-hard-working way!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish it off, thanks all of you for making my first 90 days awesome, and for all the incredible hard work you do.  I can't tell you how much easier it's made the transition for me, and I appreciate it quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Create your own yum repository</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/create-your-own-yum-repository.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-12T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-05-12T13:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-05-12:/blog/create-your-own-yum-repository.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=609"&gt;Create your own yum repository&lt;/a&gt; which pretty much discusses the createrepo tool and how to use it to create your own custom yum repository.

The scenario is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one system that can access a private school network and do not want to setup the same vpn connection on other systems.  So this little box has a connection to the school vpn, and I have the following in ~/.ssh/config in order to access it, which forwards locally to the proxy server at the school so I can get onto their internal site(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Host school
  Hostname fw.school.com
  User vdanen
  LocalForward 33306 dev.school.com:3306
  LocalForward 2228 dev.school.com:3128
  compression yes 
  KeepAlive yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this works fine.  This also means I have to ssh into the box (which is good from an authentication standpoint) in order to access any services.  Consider this a poor-man's VPN.  Incidentally it also lets me use some GUI mysql tools to access the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to use an automatic proxy.pac file on my local web server, so I have http://server/proxy.pac that contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
{
    if (shExpMatch(url, "http://*.school.com*"))
    {
        return "PROXY localhost:2228; DIRECT";
    }
    if (shExpMatch(url, "https://*.school.com*"))
    {
        return "PROXY localhost:2228; DIRECT";
    }

    return "DIRECT";
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is that I can get to http://&lt;em&gt;.school.com sites, but https://&lt;/em&gt;.school.com sites aren't hitting the proxy at all.  I use OpenDNS at home, so they keep pointing to OpenDNS.  I can work around this in Firefox by setting the network.proxy.{http,ssl} and network.proxy.{http,ssl}_port settings in about:config, but I want this to be system-wide (thus the proxy.pac file).  On OS X, if I use the System Preferences to have the auto-proxy setup and point it to the proxy.pac file, I can get the http:// sites from the school, but not the https:// ones (which is problematic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been looking and reading all over the place and there doesn't seem to be anyone with this problem that I've found so far, which either means I'm doing something wrong or no one is trying to get to https sites via a proxy setup like this.  I'm leaning towards wrong as if I do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ http_proxy="http://localhost:2228" elinks https://secure.school.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get an error about the host being down.  But if I ssh into the host and do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ http_proxy="http://dev.school.com:3128" elinks https://secure.school.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works.  I don't get it because localhost:2228 is most definitely forwarding to dev.school.com:3128.  Does anyone have any ideas on what might be wrong here?  Getting it to work in Firefox is great, but it also needs to work with Safari as well (if it didn't, I'd be satisfied with the manual settings in Firefox).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>com.apple.dashboard.advisory.fetch.plist</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/comappledashboardadvisoryfetchplist.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-04-24T10:12:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-04-24T10:12:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-04-24:/blog/comappledashboardadvisoryfetchplist.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An annoying and very CPU intensive service called dashboardadvisoryd keeps eating at my CPU on my workstation.

All I really need or want (for the most part) is a glorified chroot or BSD jail and OpenVZ fills this really nicely, without the overhead of full hardware virtualization.  It's easy to use, easy to maintain and run, and for Linux-on-Linux virtualization I think it blows away everything else I've tried for remote servers (vmware server?  no thanks!).  The fact that it's very light-weight and very configurable have given this thing a permanent place on my internal server.

So, I come to the conclusion that either: a) social networking like Facebook and Twitter make you less intelligent, or b) less intelligent people spend more time doing social networking.  (And before anyone hits me, this is (moderately) tongue-in-cheek).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one could argue that these "social networks" are more "anti-social networks" because people spend more time "interacting" with people over Facebook, Twitter, text messages, and email than they do face-to-face.  It'll be interesting to see if in 20 years we have a generation of people that don't even know how to talk to people face-to-face anymore.  I mean, if you can order books or groceries online, why go to a traditional store and rub shoulders with "real" people at all?  If you can text someone, why bother talking to them on the phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think all of these technologies that are supposed to make us more connected are actually making us all social invertebrates (a nice way of saying socially retarded).  And lazy.  I mean, good grief, this weekend I heard from my sister-in-law about a 14 year old girl she's known for years who texts her dad one floor above her in the same bloody house to tell him stuff instead of getting off her duff and walking a few steps.  Repeatedly, despite how upset her dad gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a big social networking kind of guy since I generally find people intolerable on these social networking sites (people should really have to learn to either spell or learn how to use a bloody spell checker!), but I do find they have some use (i.e. contact me via Facebook since I couldn't be bothered to give you my real email address, etc.).  I'm also only on Facebook &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; 1hr/week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's also quite possible that I'm already a social invertebrate so none of this applies to me.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Dodge the challenges of a dual-head display setup with Fedora 10</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/dodge-the-challenges-of-a-dual-head-display-setup-with-fedora-10.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-04-14T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-04-14T13:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-04-14:/blog/dodge-the-challenges-of-a-dual-head-display-setup-with-fedora-10.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=548"&gt;Dodge the challenges of a dual-head display setup with Fedora 10&lt;/a&gt; which discusses setting up a dual-head display on my Lenovo T61 and how insanely easy it ended up being... once I knew what I was doing.

&lt;p&gt;Annvix is not coming back as an operating system like it used to be, but rather a repository of packages for RHEL/CentOS (currently just version 5).  There is very little there right now: a new version of openssh and a new version of logwatch.  It will increase as time permits.  I do plan on "porting" some of the stuff I had done for Annvix to RHEL5; things like rsec, AIDE+GPG, runit, scripts to use with runit, etc.  Essentially those things that were fun to deal with on Annvix, but without the pain of managing a whole OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel like giving it a go, just execute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# rpm -ivh http://repo.annvix.org/media/EL5/x86_64/annvix-release-1.0-2.el5.avx.x86_64.rpm
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on your RHEL5 or CentOS5 install (change x86_64 to i386 if you're using an x86 system).  If you have the priority plugin setup on CentOS, make sure you edit /etc/yum.repos.d/annvix.repo and add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
priority = 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or something suitable.  The &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/"&gt;annvix.org&lt;/a&gt; web site will be updated at some point to reflect that Annvix is a repository add-on to RHEL5 now instead of a stand-alone OS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting started with the yum package manager</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/getting-started-with-the-yum-package-manager.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-03-13T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-03-13T09:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-03-13:/blog/getting-started-with-the-yum-package-manager.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=449"&gt;Getting started with the yum package manager&lt;/a&gt; which goes into some of the basics of using yum.

Using the same references (thanks, Nicu, for linking them all!) I found out that my Sindarin name is kinda cool but the Quenya name is kinda blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt; is derived from the Latin Vincentius (conquering) which comes from the Latin word vincere (to conquer).  It can also mean "victorious".  Looking it up in the &lt;a href="http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-en-sd.html"&gt;Sindarin dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, I found conquer is "orthor" and to is "an", so "to conquer" would be "an orthor".  It also notes "victory" as "tûr".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the name &lt;a href="http://www.arwen-undomiel.com/elvish/boynames.html"&gt;Elvish name translations&lt;/a&gt;, it has Vincent listed as meaning "victorious" with the elvish name being Turin (Tûrin would probably be more accurate).  The &lt;a href="http://www.elvish.org/elm/names/v.html"&gt;Quenya name translation&lt;/a&gt; would be Mapalon (it uses "conqueror" rather than "victorious").  Of the two, I like Turin better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for kicks, went and looked for my wife's name (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_(given_name)"&gt;Angela&lt;/a&gt;: Aini in Quenya and Valadhiel in Sendarin.  Sendarin sounds much cooler than Quenya in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding one for my daughter is hard, so I'll have to use the dictionary and make it up myself I think.  Funny, as a boy's name Jayden means "God has heard", and as a girl's name it's a variant of Jade (the jewel).  So if we use the jewel-name basis (which me and my wife never have), then her Sindarin name would be "Calenmiriel" although I distrust that as the meaning of the name on that page is "orange jewel" but as we all know, jade is green (bone heads).  Using the dictionary, we get "mîr" for jewel and "calen" for green, so I guess Calenmiriel isn't so far off.  And since there seem to be no Sindarin words for "God", "has", or "heard" I suppose Calenmiriel will have to be it (although if you look at the Sindarin name page, "God" would be "Eru" and the closest thing to "hearing" would be "Lathronniel", so maybe Erulathronniel for "God hearing" (which is close enough to "God has heard" for me)).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Learning Python: module import issues</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/learning-python-module-import-issues.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-03-08T13:34:00-06:00</published><updated>2009-03-08T13:34:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-03-08:/blog/learning-python-module-import-issues.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I've taken it upon myself to learn Python, which is something I've wanted to do for a while.

I usually write code in PHP or shellscript, with the odd thing in Perl every once in a while (but I'm not a real big fan of perl and I don't have the desire to dig into it more).  A lot of my more sophisticated projects that can't be done in shellscript are usually done with CLI PHP.  But Python is something I've wanted to learn, so I've started digging into it and my first dive is rewriting a CLI PHP program "suite" that creates and scours a database for RPM information (dependencies, requires, files, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been at it for about 2 weeks now with what little time I have and the original suite consists of two programs: rqp and rqs.  These two programs were a result of a rewrite of the "srpm" PHP program that Stew Benedict wrote years ago for the Mandriva secteam (and which has proven invaluable of the years).  It handled only src.rpm files, so I rewrote and extended it to handle binary and source rpm files (rqp and rqs respectively).  It was a quick-n-dirty extension that was used for a few years on the Mandriva secteam and worked really well (and probably is still working well for them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gotten rqp converted to Python and it's working quite well.  Because rqp and rqs share a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of functions, I wanted to write rqp.py and rqs.py and have a shared module between them (rq.py) and this is where I'm having issues.  Does anyone know how to have a module get access to an object from the calling program?  For instance, rqp uses the optparse module to nicely handle the commandline arguments, but a lot of the modules use options.foo to look up arguments that were passed.  The functions in rq.py (the module) can't seem to get the value of options, and while I could put the optparse stuff in the module, it would leave the actual rqp and rqs programs really really small (and I'd have to either put in two functions because the two programs use different syntax).  So I've got in rqp.py:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
import rq
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which works ok, but if rq.db_connect() requires options.database (for instance), it can't get it.  So in rq.py, I tried doing a circular import or whatever it's called by doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
import options from rqp
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this doesn't want to work either.  The output looks quite sad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% ./rqp.py -d
rqp 0.2 ($Id: rqp 275 2009-03-07 22:34:15Z vdanen $)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./rqp.py", line 548, in &lt;module&gt;
    import rq
  File "/Users/vdanen/svn/scripts/rq/trunk/rq.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    from rqp import options
ImportError: cannot import name options
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has to be a way to make the options variable (and one or two others I think) accessible to the module, but I haven't been able to find a way to do it.

But, since I'm not longer using Mandriva and need to get used to Red Hat products (Fedora, RHEL, etc.), CentOS makes sense for upgrading my internal server to.  It was also a long week, so I goofed a bit on it (I did backups of mysql and ldap, but didn't do dumps of the data which I only realized after the fact... could have been very very bad).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the system is a quad core 2 duo system with 8GB RAM.  CentOS refused to boot at first until I specified "linux acpi=off".  Downside there is it only got me the use of one core rather than the four.  That was later fixed using "pci=nommconf", which allowed the kernel to boot and got me all four cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The install went well.  Seems like a lot less to select, and therefore tweak, than the Mandriva installers I'm used to.  But it wasn't bad.  Nice thing was it picked up and auto-assembled all my mdadm RAID1 arrays, so I could format those that needed it and left the others alone.  Unfortunately, it didn't fully associate them... after the install when I booted they were in a degraded state so I had to hot-add the second partition for each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real kicker is the placement of files.  There are a few places where Mandriva and CentOS differ, like where the named chroot is, so that took some monkeying around with.  I also had SELinux in enforcing mode at first, but it didn't really like the fact that I was using /srv/www/[domain] instead of /var/www/html for serving up web content, and it didn't like the vhost.d/*.conf bit in httpd.conf so Apache was pretty broken until I disabled SELinux.  I've never actually used SELinux before, so now I have to learn how to set policies and targets and all that other goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps was setting up the rpmforge yum repository.  Too much of CentOS is just too dated for me.  I need subversion 1.5 (comes with 1.4) and nagios 3.x (comes with 2.x).  I was not going to change my nagios configs to suit the older version.  rpmforge makes all of that pretty easy though.  I did have to copy /var/lib/mysql over and other than changing the ownership of the files to match the new uid/gid for the mysql user, it all worked out great.  I have not yet done the openldap setup though, so I'm not sure if I'll be as lucky with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still quite a few configuration tweaks to make.  It also didn't help that I had to reset my network from a 10.10 network to a 192.168 network.  I'm sure that may still bite me a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it all seems to have worked out ok.  I was asked why I didn't just use Fedora for this and while Fedora may be stable enough, I don't want to have to upgrade every year.  That makes CentOS compelling.  All this machine does is run nagios to monitor other sites, provide DHCP and DNS services, LDAP for authentication for my virtual machines, web/mysql serving, and does automatic backups of other systems in the LAN.  The reason I upgraded from Corporate Server 4.0 to 2009.0 in the first place was the idea that CS5 was going to be based on 2009.0 (so I was getting a jump on things).  Time will tell how it goes, but I think it should be ok.  Last month I deployed 4 CentOS boxes for a client, with one more left to do, so I'm starting to get a little used to it and yum.  =)  The SELinux thing may be a bit more work to get used to (I've used RSBAC and AppArmor, but never really played with SELinux).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then tomorrow I'm upgrading a laptop to Fedora 11.  That should be interesting.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="centos"></category></entry><entry><title>First days at Red Hat, first impressions</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/first-days-at-red-hat-first-impressions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-02-04T21:25:00-07:00</published><updated>2009-02-04T21:25:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-02-04:/blog/first-days-at-red-hat-first-impressions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I took my first trip to the USA, ever, this week and it was down to Raleigh, NC, for orientation with Red Hat.

I'd like to say it was an experience (meaning the trip), but it wasn't... I was mostly fighting too hard to stay awake so it all really seems like a haze already.  =)  I guess only getting 1.5hrs of sleep the first night, and only 5 the second, will do that to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However... I was expecting a lot worse than it was.  I was expecting all kinds of nightmares with security getting into and out of the US and it went really smooth.  All the horror stories... well, I didn't experience them at all (thank you God!).  I got through security and customs pretty quick both ways.  The flights were uneventful for the most part (except half the plane on the way back to Chicago was full of kids doing army bootcamp and they all had nasty colds... ick).  Chicago's airport has to be the most depressing excuse for a building I've ever seen.  The fluorescent lights with that grey and blue... gah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of that was the only downside to the trip.  I went down there for orientation with Red Hat!  I'd love to gush about how exciting it was, but it was largely the corporate rigamarole: policies, things you can do, things you can't do.  Felt like school.  But the fine people who were tasked with teaching us this stuff did a fantastic job of making it as interesting as you can make this stuff, and they were a great bunch of people.  Very, very nice.  In fact, all the guys I met down there were great and really went out of their way to make me (and the rest of my "class") feel welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other cool thing was getting to hang out with Adam for two days, whom I had never met before.  That was great.  It's nice to not only put a face and voice to a name, but a personality as well.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got in really late last night, went to bed even later, and after only 5hrs of sleep my daughter couldn't &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; wake me up at 6:30 this morning.  So that's 3 nights of not nearly enough sleep.  I did survive the day, and got to chat with my new co-workers while doing more reading (I think the guys here write docs more than anything else!).  I think I have another two days of almost pure reading ahead of me.  =)  Not that I'll be reading new stuff the whole time.. the sleep-deprived fog I was in today probably means I'll have to re-read some of what I already read today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... this is day #3 at Red Hat.  First impressions?  I'm &lt;em&gt;impressed&lt;/em&gt;.  Everyone was fantastic.  They were nice, energetic, bubbly.  There's definitely a great energy here, and it's not just paid lip-service.  It's genuine.  You can feel that immediately.  They're passionate about what they do, they're energetic, they're enthusiastic.  I guess I can start saying "we" here... it's only a few days and I feel it.  It's contagious.  Actually, truth be told, I had the idea and feeling even before, during the interview process.  I got that vibe even then, and what I felt meshed with what I've been reading and re-thinking and re-training myself with over the last few months... books like GTD, Presentation Zen, Do you matter?, Tribal Leadership, and Talent is Never Enough.  These kind of philosophies and ways of thinking are what this company breathes and, I have to admit, it's both refreshing and energizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So despite the feet-dragging and being tired, there's something bubbling up that's been missing for a long time in me, and I have to admit I really like it.  I'm sure once I get a good full night sleep tonight, I'll be able to get more in tune with whatever it is and really identify it.  I mean, yeah, it's excitement because this is new and different, but it's more than that.  It's almost like a sigh of relief, or contentment... to be around people that put value on people, that recognize people for who they are not just what they can do.  People who find worth in &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;.  I dunno... too tired to properly articulate it I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to say my daughter's got the bug too.  For years she's run around the house saying "Tux" this and "Tux" that.  This last week I don't hear about Tux at all... it's "Red Hat" and "Shadowman!" (she thinks Shadowman is really really cool).  And the red fedora I got?  She thinks it's fantastic.

One of the issues I had today was getting corp3/x86_64 installed in a chroot with Mandriva 2009.0 as the host.  Of course, the db4 version had changed, so I had to take advantage of some conversion tools.  urpmi is supposed to do this magically, but it doesn't seem consistent.  Anyways, the problem lies with 2009.0's rpm using a newer version of the database than the older version.  For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# file /var/lib/rpm/Packages 
/var/lib/rpm/Packages: Berkeley DB (Hash, version 9, native byte-order)
# file /chroots/64/cs3/var/lib/rpm/Packages
/chroots/64/cs3/var/lib/rpm/Packages: Berkeley DB (Hash, version 8, native byte-order)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the trick is to convert them from the new format to the old format, which is easy enough to do once you know &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; to do.  On the host (Mandriva 2009 in this case), make sure you have db46_utils and db42_utils installed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# rpm -qa|grep "db.*\-utils"
db46-utils-4.6.21-9mdv2009.0
db42-utils-4.2.52-24mdv2009.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can use this rough-n-dirty script I wrote to convert them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
#
# script to dump and reload the rpm db to convert from hash format 9 to format 8
# for older distribs (think cs3)

for i in $(ls -1); do
    if [ "`file ${i} | grep 9`" != "" ]; then
        db_dump ${i} &gt;${i}.db46
        db42_load ${i}.db42 &lt; ${i}.db46
        mv -f ${i} ${i}.org
        mv -f ${i}.db42 ${i}
    fi
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should fix the errors you would see in the chroot, plus make it so that rpm -qa and friends actually work.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="rpm"></category></entry><entry><title>Never a dull moment with Mandriva...</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/never-a-dull-moment-with-mandriva.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-01-30T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2009-01-30T12:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2009-01-30:/blog/never-a-dull-moment-with-mandriva.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, today is my last day and so without much fanfare I say "adieu" to Mandriva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the title indicates, never a dull moment.  You get spoiled with new stuff, then have to go back and re-setup old stuff.  Part of this switch for Oden is that the build system goes with him, but of course it's cheaper to just get him new equipment than to send my aging stuff.  No problem there, and probably better.  Except that my host was 2008.1, his is 2009.0 due to some problems with 2008.1 he was having.  Then all kinds of crap started going sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I managed to get it all sorted out.  Unfortunately, it came in really close as Mandriva only gave me a week to get Oden up to speed.  I leave him in Gustavo's capable hands because, well, I had my hands full getting the new machine up to speed, nevermind Oden himself.  Oh well.  Another week would have been great, but we weren't given it.  I'm sure he'll be able to get his head wrapped around it all.  =)  If nothing else, it all seems to be working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my last week at Mandriva was exciting, frustrating as hell trying to get chroots of Corporate Server 3 installed on a 2009.0 host, and mind-numbingly slow with massive rsyncs that will end up taking about 5 days to complete (still not done).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I will probably have zero time to do much of anything with Mandriva after this and, quite honestly, I don't know if there is any desire on my part to, or any desire on my new employer's part either.  I should probably be spending any "leisure" time farting around with Fedora or RHEL at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So good luck all my many friends, past and present, at Mandriva and in the Mandriva community!  Strange and (hopefully!) wonderful things lie in store for me, I think.  I'm excited and nervous, but up for the change and challenge moving to Red Hat will give me.&lt;/p&gt;

I actually didn't know about it until today, so it's pretty cool that after having known Adam for a few years we're going to be able to actually meet face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who've read it, you know where I'm going.  For those that don't, Adam will be a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer at Red Hat.  I'm going to the same place as an, officially titled, Senior Software Engineer, but technically as a member of the Red Hat Security Response Team.  This is really exciting for me as I still get to deal with the same folks I've dealt with for years, in the same capacity -- just from a different company.  So I'm still doing security stuff, but the Red Hat process is quite a bit different from the Mandriva process so I have &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; to learn.  Still, I'm looking forward to the changes and challenges both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to feel like such a n00b for a while, I think.  Have I mentioned that I haven't used Red Hat since version 5.1 and that I looked at Fedora Core 2 for the span of 1-2 days?

&lt;p&gt;After nearly 9 years, Vincent Danen will be leaving Mandriva at the end of this month. Again we would like to thank him for his commitment and endeavour whilst at Mandriva. We wish him every success in his future activities. As he said himself, he was also largely “a pain in the developers’ collective backsides with his push for better security in the Mandriva products” and added that we may have forgiven him “because his heart was in the right place” :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have worked for Mandrakesoft/Mandriva since mid-2000. I was responsible for security updates for all released Mandriva products, and coordinated the release of all bugfix and enhancement updates as well. In addition, I tried to be creative and have initiative outside the scope of my “day-to-day” work and setup the old MandrakeSecure web site (a collection of security-related articles), the migration from Warlyzilla to Bugzilla 3.x, the migration from Twiki to MediaWiki and the merger of both official and community wiki’s into one single comprehensive community-driven-yet-official wiki. I also fondly remember many tussles with the other guys in R&amp;amp;D over security and security-related practices that made for interesting and aggressive conversations. =)
Linux-Mandrake was one of the first distributions I used seriously, and Mandriva is still my favorite. I will always have a soft spot for it, and fond memories of my co-workers and friends, and the community Mandriva is blessed to have.” said Vincent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This departure will not leave empty chair, as security is something essential for distribution. We would like to thank oden Eriksson who will be in charge of security team. Welcome back Oden!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much more to say than that.  I am, actually, extremely happy with how this worked out (Oden coming back).  I think it's fantastic that my leaving makes way for Oden to come back.  The only thing I'd like to add is that I'm leaving on my own terms... I have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; been laid off (again).  So this one actually is a good thing (well, maybe not so good for Mandriva, but...).  Anyways, to make a long story short... I'll still be doing security work, and open source stuff, but with a different company.  I'll be wearing a different hat, so to speak.  I'll leave it to the enlightened to figure out what that means.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Gmail...

There are some really irritating reasons why this is a bad idea (in my case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's use of labels is neat, and it makes IMAP folders.  Very cool.  That works well.  But those filter rules are absolutely infuriating!  I like to get some of my mail sent to my blackberry... stuff that is meant, directly, to me.  So it has to have my email address as the To: field, but I also want this to come absolutely last, after all the other filters.  It doesn't look like there's any kind of ordering, and no support for anything moderately advanced.  I found a few tutorials that allow you to use advanced boolean style arguments for searching mail, but they don't seem to work the same for filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spent about an hour fiddling with this and realized that no matter how much technology advances, nothing will ever replace fetchmail+procmail+mutt for me.  It just can't.  I don't think I'm abnormal in how I deal with my email, but for crying out loud, can they possibly dumb it down any further?  Or make finding the information to do anything with it more difficult?  How hard would it be to do a search and then have a "make this search a filter" type option?  And I'd really like to know about filter ordering, because if there is a particular order, then I might be able to live with it (i.e. filter out all mailing lists into their separate labels and then forward what's left to my blackberry).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="gmail"></category><category term="email"></category></entry><entry><title>Gah!

This little beast (the U90, model number MS-N811) is nice... a little bit bigger than my Eeepc, so the keys are bigger which is nice.  Comes with a 120GB HDD, only 512MB RAM ($40CAD later I'm at 1.5GB RAM).  I decided to give installing OS X a go on it (tried on the Eeepc last year when I got it and more or less failed miserably).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of the MSI Wind was prompted by some discussion on the Mac Ministry mailing list, and it seems like one of the best netbooks to use to install OS X on.  And for the price point, it seemed like a reasonable thing to try.  If all else failed, I could restore SUSE or stick Mandriva on it and give it to my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/12/gadget-lab-vide.html"&gt;this blog entry on Wired&lt;/a&gt; that gave me a good starting point.  I won't post the links to the MSIwindosx.iso (which is hacked copy of Leopard updated to 10.5.4).  The blog entry does pretty good on covering that and the initial basics, and where to download the OSX86Tools program you'll need.  This is more of a supplement to that, which is where I got most of what I needed.  I did do things a wee bit differently, and the end result is that now I have the latest 10.5.6 running on my Wind, with my various applications working.  The only things that don't work, as of this point (and I only did this on the 23rd), is the wired ethernet (which, by all accounts, &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; work).  I haven't tried the built-in mic, the headphones, or bluetooth.  Wireless works tho, so I'm good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wired thing got me going, so I'm going to reiterate some of it here.  What you need is the MSIwindosx.iso, which you'll get from the Pirate Bay's torrents, and OSX86Tools.  Links to both are from the Wired blog.  You'll also want a 4GB USB key (much easier to work with than a DVD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you want to do is put your USB key into an existing mac and launch Disk Utility.  Partition it to make a single MBR partition, and format it as "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)".  When it's done, select the USB parition, click on the Restore tab, and drag MSIWindosx.iso to the Source field and select the USB partition as the Destination.  Click the Restore button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that is done, unzip and launch OSX86Tools.  Click the "Install EFI/Run FDISK" button, then select "Run Script".  A Terminal window will pop up; type in your administrator password.  Type "4" to run Chameleon EFI, select the drive number, and then the partition to install.  It will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, eject the USB drive, put it into the MSI Wind, turn it on and hold down F11 and select the USB device to boot from.  Now this is where I differed slightly from the Wired article... before doing anything, launch Disk Utility (from the menu bar at the top), select the HDD in the MSI Wind, and repartition the drive.  Make sure you use the GUID partition scheme, not MBR which should be what it is currently using.  Once you've done that and formatted the partition, exit Disk Utility and you'll be back at the installer.  Continue on to the Installation Summary screen, click the "Customize" button, select "Patches", and uncheck "Kernel".  Leave everything else.  Continue the install and when it's done, reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you'll have a hacked 10.5.4 install on your MSI Wind and it should boot without problems.  You'll want to transfer the Realtek wireless LAN driver using the USB key from your mac to the Wind.  I downloaded &lt;a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/osxdrivers/Realtek_RTL8187SE_MacOS10.5_Driver_073_UI_1.6.2.zip"&gt;Realtek_RTL8187SE_MacOS10.5_Driver_073_UI_1.6.2.zip&lt;/a&gt; and transferred it via the USB key and installed it.  You'll have to reboot again to get it active.  Now, this driver is a little strange... you can't use it like a regular airport card; it creates a "bridge" type connection so OS X thinks it's a wired connection, and the tool that comes with it manages the wireless settings.  It's definitely non-mac, the UI is a little bad, but it works which is the important part.  You can opt to get a new wireless card and install it, but this works well enough for me.  Make sure you press "Fn-F11" to turn the wireless on or you may end up looking at the tool for a few minutes wondering why the heck it isn't working.  Anyways, now you can connect to your wireless network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the 10.5.6 combo update.  I chose the combo update rather than the incremental update largely because that's all I ever use.  It's a bigger download, but since I keep these things around, I just threw it on a USB key and installed from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you reboot into 10.5.6, you'll find a whole bunch of stuff doesn't work.  The keyboard and trackpad don't work, the screen resolution is off, etc.  Make sure you have a USB mouse and keyboard plugged in!  So what you need to do is pop in the USB key that still contains the MSIWindosx.iso contents and look for the /Volumes/USB/System/Installer/Patches/ directory (it may be a different root depending on what you've named the key).  Anyways, copy the Patches/ directory to somewhere convenient; I copied it to ~/Desktop/Patches/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go into the directory and remove the update and kernel pkg files.  Delete them.  You don't want them at all.  What you do want to do is reinstall all of the other pkg files.  You could do them one at a time, which is a pain, or fire up Terminal and do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cd ~/Desktop/Patches/
$ for i in *.pkg; do sudo installer -pkg $i -target "/"; done
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, and it'll take a few minutes, reboot and voila!  You'll have a fully functional 10.5.6 install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have more monkeying around to do, but so far the wired Ethernet is still not working.  Sound works, the wireless works with the third-party driver, and everything else seems to work.  I haven't tried Bluetooth yet, or the headphones or mic.  The webcam is pretty crappy... not nearly as nice as the iSight built into my macbook.  The trackpad is also extremely irritating.  It's very jumpy and erratic.  I ended up hopping into System Preferences to put the Tracking Speed down to as slow as it would go (under Keyboard &amp;amp; Mouse, then the Mouse tab).  This makes it moderately manageable.  I do need to find a way to disable the tap-is-a-click feature (I hate that at the best of times), and it doesn't do gestures or two-finger scrolling, etc.  It works moderately ok, but takes some getting used to.  I also haven't tried hooking it up to an external monitor yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, this baby works quite well.  You have to get used to the small screen size, but that's part of the experience and if you can't work with small text and small resolutions, don't even bother.  But, to me, the fact that I can get OS X running on a small machine that cost me, all told, $350CAD... well, that’s pretty sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has figured out how to fix the trackpad, please leave a comment and let me know!  There might be a kernel extension out there or preference setting somehow that could be used to configure it, but so far I haven't found it.  Another good resource, if you have the patience to poke around in it, is the &lt;a href="http://forums.msiwind.net/mac/"&gt;MSI Wind Forums&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm sure some solutions for my issues may exist there, but there are so many posts that refer to methods (but without linking to them), it's moderately painful to wade through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people on MacMin have asked how I got this going, so here you go!

Our community has declined and by the numbers I'll produce, I'm going to say it declined a lot.  I just wrote a quick shell script to parse the number of messages posted to each given list (cooker, expert, and newbie) since 2003 (takes the total for each month and adds them together to get the yearly total).  Of course, we still have 3.5 weeks in December, but I doubt that will make the numbers any more "impressive".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, to put things into perspective, some of this has likely been off-loaded to the Club forums.  I have no idea how many posts are there and how they change from year to year.  It also looks like 2005-&amp;gt;2006 was extremely significant, but my memory is hazy and I don't remember what happened there (well, I'm too lazy to try and figure out what happened there... something negative anyways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT:&lt;/b&gt; Well, a few comments have put this more into perspective, especially for the cooker list.  Anne reminded me that all the bugzilla mails used to go to cooker@ and they don't anymore (having the bugs@ list).  That accounts for the massive drop in "activity" on the cooker list.  And it seems like forums are becoming so much more popular that the mailing lists are dying as a result (not necessarily a bad thing, but at the same time... maybe shut down the "support" lists and go for a straight-forum model?)  Anyways, I'll leave the numbers up as food for thought, but it's not such a "sad metric" as I first said.  My bad.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cooker, the main development list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; cooker-2004: 51977
&lt;li&gt; cooker-2003: 51180

The first book is "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Zen-Simple-Design-Delivery/dp/0321525655"&gt;PresentationZen&lt;/a&gt;" (ISBN: 978-0-321-52565-9) which gives some really great ideas regarding presentation design and delivery of presentations.  While it primarily focuses on design pertaining to things like powerpoint, the "rules" the author talks about (be they rules of design or rules of how humans look at and interact with things) are powerful and applicable to everything, including software design/presentation, or web sites, or anything you &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second book, which I haven't quite finished yet, but which absolutely blew me away, is "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matter-Great-Design-People-Company/dp/0137142447"&gt;Do you matter?  How great design will make people love your company&lt;/a&gt;" (ISBN: 978-0-13-714244-6).  This book is freaking amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking in the context of Mandriva, this is a book every developer, manager, and CEO needs to read.  It's no revelation that we're in a bit of a tough spot and I think (although I don't know for sure) that the CEO is seeking to reinvent Mandriva in some way to make us profitable.  Nothing wrong with the idea, but the execution may be up for debate.  I have no doubt that he can do it (his track record shows he's done it before), but the dynamics are different with this kind of company compared to a traditional company.  Which makes the ideas and things brought up in "Do you matter?" especially relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic premise is that "design" is the be-all and end-all, and the ultimate indicator of good design is customer experience and, more importantly, customer &lt;em&gt;emotion&lt;/em&gt;.  So much so that the first goal and focus, above all else, should be the customer experience/emotion.  It's no surprise to anyone that without customers, no company can survive.  But without happy and satisfied customers, no company can &lt;em&gt;thrive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use one of the authors examples, look at Microsoft vs Apple.  In Microsoft's case, there is extremely poor design... in all aspects of the company (we're not just talking software here, but the whole "culture" -- everything that brings the customer an experience, whether it's good or bad).  The basic consensus of people when they think of Microsoft is like that of the utility company -- they don't really like them, but they need them.  Contrast that to Apple where most people love the products, be it the iPod, iPhone, hardware, OS... whatever.  Apple takes the design-driven company all the way.  From presentations at WWDC, to the box you get your iPod in, to the ease-of-use and look-n-feel of Mac OS X, the customer experience is the first thing in their minds.  And this is why they can charge a premium on their stuff, and people will willingly pay it.  For the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; the end user gets and the emotions it creates (think warm fuzzies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can contrast this to anything.  If you had a rotten experience at one hotel, do you go back?  Or do you try something that is more expensive and find a great experience there?  In the future, do you save a few bucks for a crappy experience, or spend a few more for a great experience?  What about the store you buy groceries from?  Where you buy coffee?  Sure, for some people price rules, but for many people it's all about the experience.  If you buy a car, and it's a really great price and turns out to be utter crap, do you buy another car from this company?  Or do you spend more to buy a better car, with a better experience?  And what is your perception of the first company?  That they sell crappy cars, have poor customer service, and you're damn well going to tell everyone you know to avoid them like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... bottom line is the customer experience and the emotions that experience generates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll probably blog more about this and break it up into a few pieces, but let me leave you with a few questions asked in the book "Do you matter?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Who are you?
&lt;li&gt; What do you do?
&lt;li&gt; Do your customers care if you live or die?
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are potent questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are you?  An open source company?  How about something deeper than that.  An open source company that provides a Linux distribution?  Still pretty vague.  Who are you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;?  An open source Linux company that aims to bring the best possible Linux-based desktop experience?  That sounds pretty good... but is that who we actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do?  Provide a Linux distribution.  Not deep enough.  Think about it.  What do we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;?  What is the actual end &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do your customers care if you live or die?  This is the real question.  With the many blog posts, articles, forum threads, and so forth I have to say that yes, our customers/users care.  Would their lives diminish somewhat if we weren't around?  I'd like to think that yes, it would.  But would it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;?  There's always Ubuntu.  Always Fedora.  I hear OpenSUSE is pretty decent.  What distinguishes &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; to the point that there would be the equivalent of an online "riot" if Mandriva all of a sudden disappeared?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have the answers to these questions.  I do know that we used to have pretty clear goals and really strove to meet them.  And we also had a massive community then too.  Extremely active mailing lists, you name it... Mandrake was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; distro.  And somehow, somewhere, we lost our way.  Maybe we lost our focus on the customer experience.  I don't know.  I do know that it can be turned around... it's not too late.  I think one solution is to become a design-driven company and put the user experience first and foremost, above everything else.  And then design our technology, methodology, philosophy, business practices, etc. around it.  It wouldn't be easy, but it could work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone running a company, or starting a company, or even anyone involved in any kind of organization or community, I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommend reading "Do you matter?".  It provides insight into things I never before thought of and answers the one nagging question I've had for years:  Why is Ubuntu so popular when it's technologically inferior?  I don't mean to start a flamewar or anything here, but the tools Mandriva has blow away anything Ubuntu has.  I've tried it, and didn't like it (possibly because I'm jaded by too much Mandriva exposure, who knows).  But that doesn't change the fact that Ubuntu has had such wild success that to many people Linux == Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes you wonder...  there are a number of tissue-creating companies out there... Scotties, Kleenex, the no-name brands you find at the grocery store.  Yet what is a tissue commonly called, without even thinking?  Kleenex.&lt;/p&gt;

The situation is that the machine that had my mirrored files has been moved somewhere else in order to ease up on rsync being an absolute bandwidth pig (great for downloading, bad when it's throwing nagios checks into fits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I've setup both a private rsync repository to get stuff from and an IP-restricted anonymous FTP.  Both instances didn't work "out of the box" with urpmi.  For one, with rsync it wasn't possible to use the password transparently.  That can be fixed with the $RSYNC_PASSWORD environment variable but it's fugly.  With curl, I'm behind a firewall and so is the remote system, and when it dropped into PASSV mode, it was using the remote's internal 192.* IP address rather than it's external IP, which was causing curl to do a whole lot of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rsync fix consisted of writing the rsync password for the user into /root/.rsyncpw (only root calls urpmi anyways), then putting at the top of /etc/urpmi/urpmi.cfg this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
{
rsync-options: --password-file /root/.rsyncpw
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Pixel, for that.  Which led me to figuring out the curl issue.  At first I set "ftp-skip-pasv-ip" into ~/.curlrc and then realized (when it didn't work) that urpmi calls curl with "-q" which basically tells curl to completely ignore any config files.  Aaarg!  So back to /etc/urpmi/urpmi.cfg to set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
{
curl-options: --ftp-skip-passv-ip
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now everything works peachy (if you need both, like me, then you'd have both options defined, one per line, in between the initial "{ ... }" of the file.  A comment in there indicating that's for custom configuration would be nice.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this may help a few people out there... googling for this led me nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva community support</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/mandriva-community-support.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-11-30T14:30:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-30T14:30:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-11-30:/blog/mandriva-community-support.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Mandriva community is small, yes, but tight-knit.

This can be evidenced by the comments in my previous blog entry and the many emails I received privately, and the many chats initiated on IRC.  It has been my honor and privilege to work with you guys, and I sincerely appreciate all the extremely kind sentiments that I received.  Despite my "layoff" being short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same short-lived layoff cannot be said about two of my friends, one of which is Adam and the other I will remain nameless unless he decides to share what happened to him.  The amount of support Adam has received via the cooker list and in this &lt;a href="http://forum.mandriva.com/viewtopic.php?t=100768"&gt;Open letter to the CEO&lt;/a&gt; (and Adam's own &lt;a href="http://forum.mandriva.com/viewtopic.php?t=100731"&gt;Leaving thread&lt;/a&gt;) are astounding and if Adam is anything like me, he can't help but appreciate the sentiments expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me think our community is capable of so much more if we just "fed" them properly.  With a little care and feeding, it could sprout into something monumental.  I mean, there are folks in the community that have been there longer than I (I've been working for Mandriva for 8.5 years, and was a contributor for about a year before that).  There are guys there even longer who have seen the ups and downs.  And they've stuck around.  I don't think we have properly expressed our gratitude for that so I'm going to express it now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You guys are steadfast and you bloody rock&lt;/b&gt;.  I can acknowledge that Mandriva would be a shadow of itself without you guys and you deserve more claps on the back and hugs than you've ever gotten.  I can only speak for myself (but I hope I speak for many others!) when I say that the Mandriva community... despite the occasional friction (which happens in any "family")... is truly a marvelous thing.  I echo many community sentiments when it comes to Adam's untimely termination, and having been (temporarily, and by mistake I guess) on the receiving end of that particular axe, I know how it feels (and the feeling definitely sucks).  I hope in this instance the community voice can be heard (&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; heard) because I've watched a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of friends come and go over the years, and it's not something I have ever enjoyed.  But being able to actually experience what each one of them must have felt gives me a greater appreciation for it, which makes me feel for them all the more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, before this gets too gushy, I just wanted to express my sincere appreciation of our small, but potentially very powerful, community.  Thank you guys!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category></entry><entry><title>Bon Voyage, Mandriva!</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/bon-voyage-mandriva.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-11-27T10:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-27T10:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-11-27:/blog/bon-voyage-mandriva.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I received some horrid news today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of December 31st, my contract with Mandriva will be terminated and I will no longer be working for Mandriva.  We've got a new CEO now, and he's determined there is to be no remote contractors, and as a result I've been booted from the camp, so to speak.  Over the last 8.5 years, I've seen CEOs come and go, restructures, other remote contractors get the boot, I've lived through the bankruptcy protection, been denied raises due to financial circumstances.  Pre-bankruptcy protection I endured getting paid piecemeal as they could afford it...  in short, I've literally put blood, sweat, and tears into my job for this company and have endured where others did not... I've stayed on when others left, and I've managed to avoid the axe when others got cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that changed this morning.  So I have one month of employment left during which time I also need to be finding a new job.  The consulting I do on the side does not make me enough to cover my day-to-day expenses (mortgage, car payment, tuition for my daughter... food).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess if anyone out there knows of a company that needs a security geek/consultant or a server administrator type, or even documentation, please let me know.  I've got one month to fill this gap, and I've got 8.5 years of hands-on Linux development, security-related work (updates, testing, QA, research), and about a decade of systems administration under my belt.  I refuse to turn this into a resume, but there's the basics (resume is, of course, available upon request... as soon as I get it updated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a firm believer in "plans", so I'm praying this is in God's timing to help me find something better, but it's difficult to be positive when you get this kind of news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT:&lt;/b&gt;  Over the last 2 hours there has been a flurry of communication.  Thank you &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much to those folks who commented here and have sent me emails.  It is very much appreciated.  I am not, however, leaving.  Apparently it was a mistake that my name was on the chopping block.  So, for the time being at least, I am not going anywhere.  The phone call from our new CEO ensures me that my contract is not being terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thank you guys so much for all the kind words.  You have no idea how much that means to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="mandriva"></category></entry><entry><title>Moved to a new provider</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/moved-to-a-new-provider.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-11-20T20:16:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-20T20:16:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-11-20:/blog/moved-to-a-new-provider.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one may be a bit long, because I'm going to use it to vent.  =)  I won't make it all "front page news", tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I signed up with a new provider, &lt;a href="http://www.wiredtree.com/"&gt;WiredTree&lt;/a&gt;.  I still have a few accounts with my old provider, &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/"&gt;WebHostingBuzz&lt;/a&gt;, but they are being slowly …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one may be a bit long, because I'm going to use it to vent.  =)  I won't make it all "front page news", tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I signed up with a new provider, &lt;a href="http://www.wiredtree.com/"&gt;WiredTree&lt;/a&gt;.  I still have a few accounts with my old provider, &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/"&gt;WebHostingBuzz&lt;/a&gt;, but they are being slowly migrated.  You may already have noticed how much faster the entire linsec.ca site is.  Since Monday night, it's been at WiredTree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I need to explain a few things.  With WHB, I had a shared reseller account which, when I got it, was wonderful.  The server was peppy, things worked extremely well, and for almost a year I was very happy with not having to deal with hardware, colocation, or any of that other nonsense.  I could edit DNS, host as many sites as I wanted, had lots of bandwidth, etc.  Downtime was minimal.  Support tickets were responded to quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's basically gone to shit since then.  About 10mos after I got the account, they took away DNS editing functionality.  Citing a bug in cPanel that was causing named to restart too often on every DNS change, they took it away indicating that it would be back when the bug was fixed upstream.  It's been almost a year.  It's still not back.  Then they took away automatic stats generation (webalizer, awstats, etc.) citing too much load on the machine.  In other words, you would have to log into cPanel and do an awstats update &lt;em&gt;every bloody night&lt;/em&gt; if you wanted good statistics.  Completely bogus, and utterly unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I watched with horror as the server I was on was consistently hitting load averages of over 50.  This week I watched with great fascination as at one point it went over 100.  In my decade of working with Linux, UNIX, and OS X, I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; seen a *NIX system with a load average that high.  Can you say over-sold many times over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing the horrid load averages last week, and being accused of being a contributor to the high load &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; being threatened with account suspension on this very site, I had had enough.  So I went looking and found WiredTree.  These guys are awesome.  Yes, I'm now paying about 8x what I was paying WHB, but I have a Virtuozzo-based VPS with a dedicated 2.4GHz xeon core and a dedicated 1GB RAM.  Ticket response time is in minutes.  I had an issue with FTP that was due to the firewall and 10 minutes later it was fixed, and this was with some back-and-forth, via email.  That fast.  So far, these guys impress me... a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.  Unlike with WHB, I have full DNS editing capabilities.  WHM has so many options available to me compared to the WHM supplied with WHB, I got lost.  I have the latest apache, php, and mysql.  It's running on a more recent CentOS (blech, but whatever).  My awstats run nightly like they're supposed to and, more importantly, without my having to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHB, on the other hand, is going so far down the crapper that if you try to post, as a registered customer, on their &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/forum/"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;, your post is now moderated by default.  You'll notice that this is an unmentioned but added "bonus" to the &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/forum/company-announcements/4041-changes-to-our-community.html#post14559"&gt;recent changes and enhancements to their 'community'&lt;/a&gt;.  (Yeah, I posted a reply to that posting... still waiting for it to be moderated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing that really gets me, and makes me glad most of my sites are moved over and the rest will be moved shortly (despite 6mos of pre-paid time still left on my reseller account) is the &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/forum/support/4028-what-happened-webhostingbuzz-com.html"&gt;blatant lies WHB responds to their customers with&lt;/a&gt;.  So this is a bit of a retelling of my own story with these guys, and a bit of warning to others who may decide to give WebHostingBuzz their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I'm partly to blame here.  I'm a firm believer of "you get what you pay for", and with WHB I basically paid next to nothing for my hosting.  I've gotten a similar return in the service, availability, speed, and support from these jokers.  And, realistically, how hard can you complain when you're only paying about $1/domain/mo?  This is also another reason when I went looking for a new provider I picked WiredTree.  I hadn't found a single negative review, and multiple glowing reviews.  Yes, they are expensive, but I don't want to have to worry about my sites, about my server being over-sold, about ridiculously high loads that slow down my sites, and I certainly don't want to wait hours to get a response to a support ticket I flag urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I want to bring attention to &lt;a href="http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/forum/14535-post7.html"&gt;Matt R's blatant lies&lt;/a&gt; about WebHostingBuzz service.  He claims the first three, individual, complainers are "entirely out of proportion", and claims they have tens of thousands of clients, with only a few unhappy ones posting there.  That might be true... what also might be true is that a fair portion of those clients are stuffed like pigs in a basket on the server I'm on.  If you look at the number of servers they seem to have, and the number of clients they claim, they &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be over-selling their servers something fierce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, he goes on to say that the average ticket response time is in "minutes".  That's the blatant lie.  More on that in a moment.  He also claims they have a bigger customer service/tech support team per server ratio than anyone else "he knows" in the business.  I'm not sure how to take that.  He could be telling the truth if he doesn't really know anyone, I suppose.  Or he could be, indeed, telling you the truth but then again, he says nothing about the competence of his staff either (which is often sorely lacking), or the fact that if you ask them five questions in an email, they'll zero in on the easiest one and ignore the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also says the forums are to interact with clients so (we) can provide feedback.  That may have been true at one point, but it's really very difficult for clients to provide feedback if they're being moderated on every post now.  Perhaps not... perhaps they read the feedback and choose to ignore it.  Perhaps they just don't want others to see the feedback they're getting... quite a bit has looked very negative on there lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I tried to post something along these lines in response to that thread but the damn forum logged me out when I tried to post and then my post was discarded.  Posting here is much safer.  Then I made a (much smaller) response, and saw the moderation message.  Gah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to bring a few examples of real-world WHB tech support response time.  Matt claims it is in minutes (and I think he's some sort of head-honcho there... an owner or high level manager anyways).  I assert it is not nearly as good, or as competent, as he claims.  First off, since May 2007 I've had to submit 40 tickets.  That's quite a bit... 2.2 tickets per month, on average.  Granted, some of this is for DNS modification requests since they took that capability away.  Back then, response times seemed pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket VST-645840 opened 05/10/2007 @12:26a, responded to at 12:40a  (nice and fast and as quick as Matt claims... too bad this is a year and a half ago and today's times are nowhere as good)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket GWU-456574 opened 11/08/2008 @7:18p by Oleg, threatening the linsec.ca site with suspension because mediawiki and wordpress were taking too much CPU.  My response at 7:56p to ask for more data, how it was gathered, and what the sampling was like, was responded to 11/11/2008 @11:28a.  Two and a half days later (remember, they wanted &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to do something here, and all I did was ask for information that would aid me in solving the problem).  I responded @3:52p (no rush because, after all, he never answered any of my questions and if he can take 2.5 days to reply, why can't I?).  I also told them they disabled my ssh access which made diagnosing things more difficult too (and, FWIW, top was showing php spikes of loading my pages hit 25% CPU usage, but these spikes lasted 1-2s which doesn't seem to me to be abnormal considering they're forcing us to run PHP5 as a CGI, not a DSO).  Anyways, his response on 11/12/2008 @12:44p (another day later), was to tell me that ssh access was re-enabled.  And &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; Oleg did not answer any of my questions other than to try to upsell me to a VPS or dedicated server plan.  The rest of this ticket is just plain dumb...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket TDV-745991 opened 11/17/2008 @11:01p for an urgent DNS modification (urgent because I needed this in order to start moving my sites to WiredTree).  Andrey responded 20 minutes later to indicate it was done.  This is good response time.  It was also a relatively simple request (although I should note that I've asked for simple things in the past, like DNS changes, that they somehow managed to thoroughly screw up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket LVB-325373 was opened by Oleg 10/16/2008 @6:46a and this time they didn't threaten account suspension, they actually did it.  In all fairness, the site had a misbehaving Drupal so it needed to get fixed and I get that, but...  @2:07p I responded and asked for the account to be unsuspended so I could fix it (these times must be UTC because I'm quite certain this was a first-thing-in-the-morning thing).  I replied again @2:39p.  At 3:35p I was phoning their office because I still didn't have a response.  Thankfully it got fixed via the fellow on the phone because I didn't actually get a response (from Igor), until 12:48p the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket SQA-686130 was opened 10/12/2008 @2:13a to get some DNS modifications done.  It was responded to at 1:45p the same day by Evgeniy.  Not quite the "minutes" Matt is talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go through all 40 tickets I filed with WHB over the last year and a half.  I think, however, that my point stands.  I could see if one of these was abnormal, but we're talking about 12hr turn arounds, next day responses, and even a few days later in some cases.  Certainly not the fast turn around time they're professing to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I highly do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommend WHB if you want any kind of reliable service.  And, food for thought... with similar ping times to both WHB's server and WiredTree's server (i.e. may 2-3ms differences), the linsec.ca frontpage loaded between 2-3s consistently where annvix.org's frontpage loaded in about 8-9s consistently, with one instance where it took a whopping 45s to load.  Guaranteed these slow speeds are due to a) running PHP as a CGI instead of a DSO and b) the high load averages on the server.  Oh, and to make things more interesting, they must have had to force a reboot because today they posted the RAID arrays were re-syncing, but after about 8hrs they had only synced from 20% to 26%... and the load averages still are hitting in the high 30's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line... these guys may be competitively priced (aka cheap) but their service is pretty "cheap" too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Use Dovecot for POP3/IMAP services</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/use-dovecot-for-pop3imap-services.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-11-18T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-18T11:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-11-18:/blog/use-dovecot-for-pop3imap-services.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=299"&gt;Use Dovecot for POP3/IMAP services&lt;/a&gt; which discusses how to setup and use Dovecot to provide POP3 and IMAP services.

&lt;p&gt;Instead of integrating with bugzilla, we've used the mediawiki framework.  The reasons for this many.  The biggest reason is to make the "Testzilla" as accessible as possible to as many people as possible.  It is also to lower the bar to usability... anyone can look at information on the wiki, but dealing with Testzilla can be trickier (perhaps).  Also, Testzilla itself hasn't been updated in many years, which means a lot of hacking to make it work.  Other solutions were either too complicated (Testopia) or didn't integrate with anything else we currently had (using mediawiki allows us to re-use our authentication from my.mandriva.com).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the basic idea is to have a page per package (urpmi, eclipse, evolution, whatever) and on this page will be testcases -- descriptions of ways to test programs in that package.  Where possible, automated or semi-automated testcases should be written and these get committed to subversion and referenced from the wiki page (the downside here is we need a mechanism to get testcases from people without commit access in, but the upside is it is faster, provides versioning, and won't bog down the wiki with (hopefully!) numerous testcases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already implemented the main page, which can be found at &lt;a href="http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Testing"&gt;wiki.mandriva.com/en/Testing&lt;/a&gt;, and from there you can get to the various testcases (there's only one on there right now).  There is a cookie-cutter template to be used to start new testcases pages, and there are some new macros that make integrating with subversion and bugzilla a little easier/nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I think this has the potential to do really good things for Mandriva, and probably other distributions as well.  With the ability for anyone to create testcase pages, testcases, send an email with an automated testcase attached to our new testcases_@_mandrivalinux_dot_org "exploder" to get committed to subversion, it should be extremely easy and straightforward for people to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that quite a few people on the cooker list expressed an interest in, so I'm hoping this will nicely take off and become yet another useful resource for the Mandriva community.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category></entry><entry><title>Using dnsmasq for DNS and DHCP services</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/using-dnsmasq-for-dns-and-dhcp-services.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-11-04T11:58:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-04T11:58:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-11-04:/blog/using-dnsmasq-for-dns-and-dhcp-services.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=293"&gt;Using dnsmasq for DNS and DHCP services&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses using dnsmasq in place of software like BIND and ISC's dhcpd (or other similar packages).

The NaNoWriMo (&lt;a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/"&gt;National Novel Writing Month&lt;/a&gt;) is "contest" to encourage people to write a novel.  The goal is to write 50k words in one month.. from scratch, starting at 00:01 on Nov 1st with the deadline being 23:59 on Nov 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to do it.  I've been wanting to get back into writing speculative fiction for a few years now but work, wife, kid, Xbox, etc. have all gotten in the way.  =)  Very few people know this about me, but back when I was in highschool I started a fantasy trilogy and wrote 2.5 books in it.  I never did finish it.  I picked up reading it a few months ago and now I think those rejection letters of the happily-optimistic-16-year-old were well justified.  =)  It's not that the writing was awful but dang it... I had enough ideas crammed in there for 20 books and the writing style wasn't the greatest (at least not to begin with but, then again, I started it when I was in grade 9 (so, what, 14 years old?).  The stuff near the end when I was 18 was much much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I have no idea what I'm going to write about other than that it will be fantasy-ish (but I don't like using the term fantasy because that gives ideas of Tolkien and unicorns and furry hobbits, etc. -- what I have rattling around in my skulll is more like mythology than fantasy).  Should be interesting.  No idea what, if anything, will happen with it come the end of November but maybe it'll get these creative juices flowing again.  If nothing else, it'll be fun to try and write something that isn't "technical" in nature.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Use DropBox to seamlessly sync files</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/use-dropbox-to-seamlessly-sync-files.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-28T10:47:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-10-28T10:47:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-10-28:/blog/use-dropbox-to-seamlessly-sync-files.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=288"&gt;Use DropBox to seamlessly sync files&lt;/a&gt; which discusses the DropBox service to synchronize files seamlessly and automatically between Windows, Mac, and Linux computers.

Tonight it went live on &lt;a href="https://qa.mandriva.com/"&gt;qa.mandriva.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Although it could have gone up 6 weeks ago, due to the release of 2009.0 coming up (which always leads to a massive influx of bug reports both before and after a release) we decided to wait for a few weeks after 2009.0 was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade went quite smooth (due to the preparation and, most importantly, notes taken from the testing almost two months ago), so everything should be up and running in good order.  If there are issues, feel free to comment to me directly or file a bug report.  I think, however, that users will find the new version of Bugzilla contains some welcome features and I also took the opportunity to change the layout somewhat to make it adhere more to web standards (such as making font resizing easier, etc.).  I also condensed the layout somewhat by using the default Bugzilla templates and re-working them from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone likes it.  There will probably be more tweaks coming and rc2 is supposed to be coming out fairly soon from what I've heard, so there will still be changes forthcoming, although I hope they are more minor than what changed tonight.  I'm also hoping this will improve performance somewhat as Bugzilla 3.2 is using InnoDB rather than MyISAM storage types, which from my understanding should also help improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Improve MySQL performance with MySQLTuner</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/improve-mysql-performance-with-mysqltuner.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-24T10:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-10-24T10:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-10-24:/blog/improve-mysql-performance-with-mysqltuner.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=285"&gt;Improve MySQL performance with MySQLTuner&lt;/a&gt; which discusses how to use the MySQLTuner perl script to tune the MySQL server to ensure you're not over-committing resources, that your configuration is sane, and giving helpful pointers on how to optimize your MySQL databases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="mysql"></category></entry><entry><title>Searching with GNOME Do</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/searching-with-gnome-do.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-16T15:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-10-16T15:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-10-16:/blog/searching-with-gnome-do.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's TechMail was &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=284"&gt;Searching with GNOME Do&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses the application launcher GNOME Do, a fantastic little application.

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this release was different in many ways.  For one, I actually got my fingers into the pot in quite a "low level" way, which has never happened before (largely because it was never permitted in the past).  I guess it's probably due to the leaving of some people and perhaps a little more persistence on my part.  I'd also like to think that earlier this year, for the first time in the 8 years of working for Mandriva, I actually met my co-workers in France face-to-face.  Strangely enough, that made an amazingly huge impact on how we relate and work together.  I guess for everyone we now know there are "real people" on the other side of that email message or IRC comment.  I must admit, that face-to-face has really helped and I actually regret not having gone over there before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the development stuff I was involved in this time was some extra pam work (getting the tcb suite integrated which includes pam_tcb (to replace pam_unix) and the extras that come with it to offer a more secure authentication system (although we did find out that poorly designed screensavers meant we had to reduce some of the security benefits of using pam_tcb in order to accommodate their bad design)).  Also, I was the one that incorporated the "know how" from Annvix to get blowfish support into glibc (which inadvertently broke the sha512c support in glibc.. we'll get that fixed eventually).  So now, Mandriva Linux 2009 uses tcb and blowfish passwords by default (although tcb is using the shadow scheme by default, not the tcb scheme).  This is really important since the next version of Corporate Server will be presumably based on 2009, which means it will get tcb support and also means that Corporate Server 5 will be similar to Annvix in some of it's hardening features).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't deny it was trying and time-consuming... =)  Juggling security updates, tcb integration/testing/debugging, and bugzilla maintenance has definitely taken it's toll.  I think the end result is really great though.  I have two systems left to upgrade to 2009 before they're all using it and have had very few problems (some minor issues with the EeePC that eventually got worked through was about it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So congrats to everyone involved with the 2009 development!  From what I can see so far, this is a really good release.  Of course, now that it's released, I'll have a busy 2 weeks ahead of me doing all the bugfix updates, but it's all good.  There's really only two times of the year that I get super busy in a 3 week stretch, and that's the week prior and the two weeks after a release.  This week has gone much smoother than past releases (despite the nasty cold I obtained from the Opeth concert last week!), so I'm hoping that the next two weeks are just as smooth (busy I expect, smooth would be an added bonus).&lt;/p&gt;

I had previously upgraded to 1.5.1 when it came out (from 1.4.x) and found I couldn't commit to svn+ssh urls.  1.5.2 fixes that, but has a naughty habbit of upgrading the repository format behind your back.  So, if you have a working copy you checked out with 1.4.x and then do anything in that working copy it upgrades it to the new format for 1.5.x.  Sadly, it doesn't tell you it's doing this and as a result, those working copies are essentially useless if you need to back out to 1.4.x for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, however, but subversion will upgrade parts of your working copy piecemeal.  For instance, I keep all my web development stuff in ~/svn/websites/.  So after upgrading to 1.5.2 today I did some work in ~/svn/websites/intranet/ and that directory, and it's subdirectories, were upgraded to the new format.  The top-level directory, however, and the rest of the working copy, were not (they were still using format 8 rather than format 9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess with a CLI client this might not matter so much, but it caused me some grief using &lt;a href="http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/"&gt;Cornerstone&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial svn client.  Fortunately, the author is super-responsive and pointed me to &lt;a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/tools/client-side/change-svn-wc-format.py"&gt;this change-svn-wc-format.py script&lt;/a&gt; which I can use to update all my working copies (I'm not trusting subversion to do it properly for me right now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, if anyone else gets in this same boat, here's some info on how to resolve it.  I like using Cornerstone on my mac (it's about the only GUI svn client I can stand); otherwise I'd be using the CLI client and probably never would have found this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="subversion"></category></entry><entry><title>Listen to music with open source Banshee</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/listen-to-music-with-open-source-banshee.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-07T18:13:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-10-07T18:13:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-10-07:/blog/listen-to-music-with-open-source-banshee.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=281"&gt;Listen to music with open source Banshee&lt;/a&gt; which is a brief introduction to the Banshee music player.

&lt;p&gt;I'm reading David Allen's Getting Things Done book and this quote really stuck out at me.  Totally true.  I know a few people to whom the latter belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this is a really good book.  I've already gotten some fantastic ideas from it and am already shifting my way of thinking, and I'm only 1/4 through the book.  I've been trying to ascribe to the GTD "methodology" through the use of GTD-related software, but I have yet to turn it into a lifestyle.. so far it's been nothing more than a few bits and pieces here and there, mostly relating to my work with Mandriva which has really had the advantage of keeping me and getting me focused.  Of course the GTD "methodology" could be used everywhere -- from work, other hobby projects, and personal life too.  I'm always looking for ways to be more efficient and by reading this I'm seeing what I've been doing wrong, what I could be doing better, etc.  Really good stuff.  I plan to read it through once then go back with my highlighter once I've got the overall concept so I can really amplify the parts I struggle with and really need to have sink in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, highly recommended.  Even if you think you're efficient now (and you could very well be), there's always remove for improvement and doing things better/faster/easier should be an aspiration for anyone who has less time than they'd like (and who among us can honestly say we have &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; time for everything we want to do?).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="gtd"></category></entry><entry><title>Try command-line looping for added efficiency</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/try-command-line-looping-for-added-efficiency.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-09-22T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-09-22T09:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-09-22:/blog/try-command-line-looping-for-added-efficiency.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's TechMail was &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=270"&gt;Try command-line looping for added efficiency&lt;/a&gt; which discusses using loops in the shell to iterate over a number of items while using particular commands (i.e. for loops in the shell).

You won't see it anywhere official until 2009.0 is released most likely, but having (some) spare time, I wouldn't to put it through the paces in a vmware machine to make sure I can document everything that needs doing and minimize downtime when it comes time to do the actual upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far it's looking pretty good and has some really nice features to it.  Due to the heavy changes in the templates, the templates look more stock now than they did before, which actually manages to clean up a lot of the interface and remove duplicate information.  I also took the opportunity to style it as best I can to respect user font sizing.  The look has changed a little bit along the way as I had to redo all the theming from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, for anyone interested in taking a peek at it or playing around with it a bit before it goes live, you can do so at &lt;a href="http://bugzilla.annvix.ca/"&gt;bugzilla.annvix.ca&lt;/a&gt;.  It's a snapshot of the Mandriva database from a week ago (more or less), and uses the same authentication, etc. as the Mandriva bugzilla.  To prevent confusion, I've turned postfix off so mail notifications aren't being sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-in-all, the upgrade should go fairly smoothly and result in downtime of an hour or two, when it happens.  It could probably be implemented now, but I'd rather wait until 2009.0 is released and things have settled down, so consider this a preview until such a time as it does get moved over.  Any suggestions or whatever are also welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="bugzilla"></category></entry><entry><title>Expanding text with Snippits in Linux</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/expanding-text-with-snippits-in-linux.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-09-09T11:01:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-09-09T11:01:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-09-09:/blog/expanding-text-with-snippits-in-linux.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=265"&gt;Expanding text with Snippits in Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses using Snippits (a ruby app) to do text expansion.

Russ determined that this was the beginning of the end for AppArmor, and I read it with some interest largely because Mandriva has settled on AppArmor as our security solution... largely because it fits with our ideal of making things nice and easy for our users.  So of course, a post that seems to bring doom and gloom about our security solution is something we're interested in reading about because if it's true, then we've invested time and effort into the wrong solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read it and thought it had some interesting points, but I didn't think they were overly valid and it didn't concern me too much.  Yeah, it all seems indicative of the demise of AppArmor (the entire AppArmor team being laid off, the inclusion of SELinux in future products, etc), but there is no real indication that AppArmor is being discontinued or killed off as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Crispin wrote a blog entry responding to it yesterday, entitled &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/crispincowan/archive/2008/09/02/go-ahead-make-my-day.aspx"&gt;Go Ahead, Make My Day&lt;/a&gt;.  Essentially he indicates that there is a bit of paranoia associated with Russ' post in the conclusion he draws about AppArmor's demise.  Of course, Crispin works for Microsoft now and he makes a valid point.  If AppArmor is dying, and since Crispin is working for Microsoft to improve the security mechanisms in Windows' products, then his job is made easier (thus the title).  If Windows security has to compete with the complexity of SELinux, then he indicates his job is all that much easier because all he has to do is make Windows security "easier and more effective to deploy than SELinux".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he makes a good point.  If SELinux is the "standard", then security mechanisms that are both easier to use and easier to deploy will become more popular and will just add fuel to the "Linux is harder than Windows" argument.  I disagree with that argument... personally, I find Linux easier and Windows more frustrating.  But if Windows comes out with something as effective and easy to use as AppArmor, and AppArmor is dead and we're all using SELinux, when people wake up and realize that good security doesn't necessarily mean all the complexities of SELinux and similar systems are a necessity, then the argument would be true: Linux would indeed be harder to use than Windows simply due to the (what I believe will soon become a necessity for anyone using a computer) inherent security designs in a user's chosen operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, while Russ may be right (after all, I don't work for Novell so I can't lay something like this to rest, I can only speculate, as can Russ and also Crispin), I sincerely hope he's wrong.  SELinux may be a fantastic system for those who use it, but for those of us who don't require military-grade security, AppArmor does a very nice job thank-you-very-much of keeping our systems safe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="apparmor"></category><category term="selinux"></category></entry><entry><title>One-time scheduling of tasks with At</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/one-time-scheduling-of-tasks-with-at.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-08-28T09:25:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-08-28T09:25:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-08-28:/blog/one-time-scheduling-of-tasks-with-at.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's techmail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=260"&gt;One-time scheduling of tasks with At&lt;/a&gt; which discusses one-shot scheduling with the 'at' tool, rather than using something like cron.

Don't know how many of you are with a hosting outfit rather than running your own server (be it at home, work, or at a colocation), but I have a bit of an issue here when I reported a problem with my web hosting outfit's exim configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every trouble ticket I've submitted, I've done my due diligence in trying to figure out the problem, provide as much relevant information as possible, and often suggest a fix for the problem.  More often than not I have to go through the same thing 2-3 times because they come back with canned/stock answers and seem to be largely less clueful than the grocery store clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with this wordpress issue from the last post, and having to change my configuration and patch a non-configuration file, the problem is clearly with the hoster and their exim configuration (not allowing locally-generated mail to "relay" via the server).  The problem is that it isn't really a relay if it's coming from the local host.  So what if my MX record points to a different server.  That's not unheard of at all.  So the issue is clearly that exim is doing MX lookups and deciding that the from domain isn't local, so it must be a relay.  That's fine, provided that it's not doing the check on locally-generated mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that's not the big issue.  The response I got from the technical support team told me that some configuration options were not correct in wordpress and that I should check those fields, correct them, and possibly check some others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, those fields have nothing to do with the problem (they belong to wordpress' ability to check for new posts via a POP3 account).  But this individual obviously went snooping through my MySQL database to figure that out.  And he also clearly doesn't know wordpress that well, otherwise he wouldn't have made the idiotic suggestion in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...  do you think web hosting outfits like this have the right to go looking through files and databases as they please?  He never asked if he could look at the database or anything else.  He took it upon himself to go poking wherever he pleased.  Now, I know when I was doing hosting at the colo that I would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; look at a client's files or databases.  The only exception I would make was if there was a suspicion of them doing something that violated the terms of service (i.e. hosting illegal files, etc.).  Otherwise, their stuff is their stuff and I have no more right to it than looking at their email or even their snail mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never experienced this before and, frankly, it makes me uncomfortable.  I don't know if this is "standard practice" for these guys, or if this is an industry thing, and I certainly don't recall reading in their terms of service that they granted themselves the right to poke through my files/data as they pleased.  But maybe this is something that they're allowed to do?  It is their hardware, after all.  But then again, I should have some reasonable expectations of privacy -- to some degree -- right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to go through the hassle of switching hosting providers if the next outfit I go to will pull the same thing, which is why I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>WordPress and bad from address handling for email</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/wordpress-and-bad-from-address-handling-for-email.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-25T14:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-07-25T14:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-07-25:/blog/wordpress-and-bad-from-address-handling-for-email.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there's one thing that irked me about WordPress, which I more or less ignored for months, was the inability to change the "From" address on emails it sent.

It's hard-coded to "wordpress@${sitename}" and when you have some... weird... domain hosters, this can cause problems.  I haven't received comment notification for a few months now as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, in my particular case, is that my hoster is extremely anal about mail relays.  If the from address isn't locally-deliverable, it punts the message with a "relay not permitted".  This is simply foolish, and I've already complained, but I have my doubts they'll change anything.  &lt;sigh&gt;  In my case, the linsec.ca site is hosted at my domain hoster, but the mail for linsec.ca is handled by Google.  So when a message goes out from wordpress@linsec.ca (regardless of whether it's a deliverable address or not, regardless of whether I define an email address on the domain server (that would never really get mail, but I was hoping it would trick exim somewhat)), it gets punted as a relayed address because the MX records for linsec.ca don't point to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could all be extremely easily avoided by letting people change the From address in WordPress.  And it's such a stupidly simple hack.  So when I upgraded to the latest WordPress and found it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; didn't allow it, I finally implemented a quick fix and am putting it here for others who face the same irritation.&lt;/p&gt;

This week I had the opportunity, and the obligation, to spend a bit more time with it.  Next month I'm converting an office that's currently using Windows and Exchange for an OS X-based solution.  There will be a few desktops, a laptop, and an xserve.  Not really a big deal for what he wants as OS X server will take care of pretty much everything and I knew that it wouldn't take me too long to catch onto it, but I wanted to take the time to figure out any quirks before I actually obtained the hardware and started billing for my time.  Since the server software purchase will get absorbed in the cost of the work, and would probably save a lot of time down the road, I picked up a copy late last week and have been slowly working this week to get my old dual G5 up and running to (temporarily, at least) replace my Mandriva-based LAN server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read some blog posts in the last week or so saying how Apple deviates too much from UNIX, how OS X server isn't as good for web serving as Linux, etc.  Unfortunately, those posts look worse for the blogger than for the software.  OS X server is no worse for web hosting (or "service" hosting) as anything else.  The problem is these people probably spent a few hours or maybe a day or two at most trying to figure stuff out.  And they took all their Linux "baggage" with them.  Well, they're right in one thing... it is different.  Very different.  Is it worse?  Not really... it does the same job.  The tools are different, file locations are different, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server I setup has the following duties:  DHCP, DNS, intranet wiki, nagios monitor, SMTP relay (for the LAN going out), POP3/IMAP (LAN-only), file sharing (samba and since we're using OS X here AFP as well), LDAP for authentication, and subversion server.  The client's xserve will do most of this, except for nagios.  It will also require handling a VPN, so I will be setting up mine to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few things that are different.  Server Admin is a very cool GUI tool to configure the server.  For the most part, it works really really well.  It was somewhat painful setting up DHCP and DNS since I couldn't import my old named zone files and such (at least not that I could find).  But after an hour of mind-numbing and boring typing, it worked well enough.  Setting up Apache was easy enough and Server Admin works for some basic stuff, although if you really want to do more complex things, you'll want to fiddle around in &lt;i&gt;/etc/apache2/&lt;/i&gt; to make changes.  One word of warning:  some stuff you can change and still use Server Admin and it won't get mangled.  Some stuff you can't so I suggest getting the basics done in Server Admin and then &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; using it to manage sites (even viewing the site seems to be enough to trigger an update of the config file).  In particular, setting "DAV svn" to enable the http subversion access resulted in (repeated) changes to "DAV off".  Apparently Server Admin doesn't thing "svn" is a valid option here.  Also, rewrite rules kept getting rewritten... with a whole lot of nothing.  I use rewrite rules extensively for my mediawiki install so it ticked me off a few times when all of a sudden they stopped working.  Beyond that, Server Admin works well enough for Apache (again, more basic stuff).  I suppose I could be using .htaccess files for this stuff and then I wouldn't have to worry about Server Admin removing stuff on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up subversion was pretty easy, less the rewriting noted above.  &lt;a href="http://blog.paploo.net/2007/10/how-to-manage-your-own-subversion.html"&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; was moderately helpful for anyone else interested in setting up a subversion server on OS X.  Leopard is using 1.4.4, but I think I'll be upgrading that soon, which may prove interesting to see if/how it will use the new modules instead of the old ones without actually removing the old subversion setup, since it comes with OS X.  Setting up ViewVC for a web view of the subversion repository was pretty straightforward as well.  No real surprises there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagios was more interesting.  Actually, it wasn't too bad... just time consuming.  The Mandriva nagios configs are.. fugly.. to put it bluntly.  Too many files, too many different places to look, so I spent quite a bit of time smushing all the useful stuff into a half-dozen configs which makes it much easier to manage.  I built the latest nagios and nagios plugins from source.  Before that, make sure you have something like fink or macports (I use fink) installed, as well as the Xcode developer tools.  Beyond that, it was pretty straightforward as well.  The only problem I ran into was the check_ldap(s) plugins didn't want to work... not sure if this is due to a newer version or if it's due to Open Directory.  I've disabled that plugin for now (although, strangely enough, the check_ircd plugin works now when it wasn't working on Mandriva... go figure).  Oh, if you like to use the check_fping plugin, use fink to install fping but make sure you make /sw/sbin/fping suid root, otherwise the plugin running under nagios (which here runs as nagios:nagios) won't be able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL was easy.  Set the root password in Server Admin and imported a dump of my database.  No issues there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mail was different, and I used Server Admin exclusively for that.  Seems to have enough options and through it can handle spam filtering via spamassassin and virus scanning via clamav.  I'm used to exim myself, and OS X uses postfix, so I think I'll let Server Admin handle that part.  What I've done with it so far works well enough, and POP3 works.  I'm thinking of seeing if I can get procmail and fetchmail running on there to grab my mail, filter it all into individual IMAP mailboxes, and just use IMAP to connect to my local server to get all my mail.  Not sure if that will work very well (due to personal and work accounts being smushed into one IMAP setup), but I think that would largely be a client-side issue anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weirdest thing for me, and the one big drawback to OS X that I found, was the handling of IP aliases.  I don't want to write silly route commands, I want aliases to be setup once and persist across reboots, etc.  Took me a bit, but it's clumsy compared to Linux.  With Mandriva, I just create new /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:0 files and go to town.  With OS X, you have to edit /etc/IPAliases.conf and stuff like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
en0:10.10.2.1
en0:10.10.2.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you have to reboot to enable it.  Also don't forget to edit /etc/hostconfig and set "IPALIASES=-YES-" (I didn't realize I needed to do this and couldn't figure out for a few minutes why my aliases weren't coming up after a reboot).  "man IPAliases.conf" is a good place to look as well.  Finally, note that OS X will get, and use, the DNS name of the &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; defined IP alias.  I have no idea why, since my computer's name is "fenris", why the shell prompt and "hostname" were giving me the name "dns", which happens to be the DNS name of the last IP defined in /etc/IPAliases.conf.  However, if the name reported by hostname is important, use one of the aliases in the Network settings of System Preferences and put the IP address that belongs to the DNS name (A record, please) as the last IP alias.  There's also no "eth0:0" or "eth0:1" so you can't just shut off one alias and add another on-the-fly like you can in Linux.  all IPs are assigned to the associated ethernet device, so in my case if I were to do "/sbin/ifconfig en0" you'd see all five associated IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was probably the weirdest thing to deal with, besides file location differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and system-wide cron stuff.  Normally I drop a script or symlink to a script in /etc/cron.daily/, but OS X uses periodic instead.  It's not very different, so just create the script/symlink in /etc/periodic/daily/ instead and it will be run with the daily system jobs (i.e. I created /etc/periodic/daily/900.svn-verify to execute the daily script I run to verify the integrity of my subversion repositories).  The only real difference here against cron on a Linux system is that unless you redirect output to /dev/null, the output of cron scripts gets emailed to you (well, if you provide an email address).  Not so with periodic, at least not by default.  I assume there must be a way to do it, but my daily output, instead of coming to my inbox, went into /var/log/daily.out instead.  I don't like that since I want to have delivered to me notification that my svn repos need repair; I don't want to have to remember to look at the file.  I need to look into this further... I suspect it shouldn't be too difficult, but I'm not familiar with periodic at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, LDAP authentication.  On my network, I use LDAP authentication on all the Linux workstations and vmware images just because it makes it easier on me.  I've not had much luck getting OS X workstations to authenticate against my Linux-based LDAP directory, so with Open Directory on OS X server, it's quite easy to make it work with OS X workstations.  I also found out it was quite easy to do with Linux as well and didn't really take much to change it (since Open Directory is based on OpenLDAP).  A few minor tweaks to my /etc/ldap.conf file and I was up and running.  The only thing I had to remember was that OD exports the home information as being /Users/foo, instead of /home/foo.  This is easy enough to remedy, by either making /Users a symlink to /home, or moving /home to /Users.  For anyone interested, my /etc/ldap.conf for Mandriva looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ldap.conf for authentication against OpenDirectory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;host fenris.annvix.ca
base dc=fenris,dc=annvix,dc=ca
ldap version 3
scope one
pam_filter objectclass=posixAccount
pam_login_attribute uid
pam_password crypt
nss_base_passwd cn=users,dc=fenris,dc=annvix,dc=ca?one
nss_base_shadow cn=users,dc=fenris,dc=annvix,dc=ca?one
nss_base_group cn=groups,dc=fenris,dc=annvix,dc=ca?one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ssl start_tls&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ssl off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;OpenDirectory home directories are /Users/foo, so create&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;a /Users directory and symlink appropriate /home directories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;there (or rename /home to /Users)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;everything else is configured the same as if using a LDAP auth source&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I have to figure out the SSL/TLS stuff in Open Directory yet.  There's also some kerberos stuff in there I'm thinking of playing with to make everything single-signon.  But that will come later.  For my home network, this is sufficient, and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing left to do now is the VPN stuff, but I'll do that this weekend when I can go to my dad's and borrow his internet connection to see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, as of right now my Mandriva LAN server is temporarily off and I'm going to be using the OS X server for the next week or two, to make sure there are no surprises.  That way, next month when I have to do mostly the same thing for a client, there won't be (too many) surprises.  So is OS X server worse than Linux?  Not really.  They're both pretty much the same.  Those who like GUI configs will like OS X server... the Server Admin and Workgroup Manager tools are really quite nice.  For someone like me who developed Annvix without a GUI, I don't much care, and the (compared to Linux) non-standard location for files was frustrating and trying.  There's obviously a lot to fiddle with yet, but the basic services are up and running which is what I need.  When this thing has a few services turned off so my Mandriva server can once again resume it's duties, it'll be left around for a debugging/reference platform as it's always nicer to muck up your own stuff instead of a client's.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Linux != Windows</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/linux-windows.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-03T19:47:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-07-03T19:47:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-07-03:/blog/linux-windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came across this great article today entitled &lt;a href="http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm"&gt;Linux is Not Windows&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;He breaks it down into the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1 Linux isn't exactly the same as Windows&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2 Linux is &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; different from Windows&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3 Culture shock&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3a There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a culture&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;6 Imitation vs Convergence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;7 That FOSS thing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very well articulated and quite intelligent.  Most of all, it makes sense... &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; sense.  It would even make sense to the guy whining that Linux isn't exactly the same as Windows, and gives good reasons as to why it a) never will be and b) never &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Dig for more data in the /proc directory</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/dig-for-more-data-in-the-proc-directory.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-03T16:55:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-07-03T16:55:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-07-03:/blog/dig-for-more-data-in-the-proc-directory.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one is over a month old and got lost in my inbox, so I'm posting it now.

Presumably they would be discussing metal here and by that nature, presumably they're not really looking for "chart" bands because metal wasn't as "mainstream" as it is today (of course, today's definition of metal and all of the available sub-genres make most of today's metal crap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quite amusing to read some of the posts.. people thinking Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, and Def Leppard were mentioned.  Folks... that isn't really metal.  That's hard rock.  The so-called hair metal or "glam metal" of the 80's wasn't real metal.  That was all hard rock.  Just the fact that those bands got air time in the 80's is proof enough they weren't real metal.  The thread is a bit old so I didn't bother posting to it, but it made me think... so here I am listening to some old Venom and I have to say that the best bands (and by best I mean innovative, stuck to their principles and didn't sell out (at least not in the 80's), as well as those that turned around and defined the genre or influenced a lot of later bands) are probably Venom, Slayer, Metallica, and Iron Maiden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, out of those I mentioned, only Maiden got the most "credit".  In the 80's, Maiden had some really great albums.  Albums like Powerslave and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son are remarkable.  I'm surprised Venom didn't get more credit... while I don't really go for all the pro-Satan lyrics, musically these guys were trend-setters.  I get why they didn't really get "mainstream" even in the metal scene then... the music was quite harsh and raw, and the vocals leave a bit to be desired, but that's the whole point.  That sound defined a genre.  Look at bands like Metallica and Slayer who cite Venom as big influences.  And Slayer... well... for thrash metal, they were true pioneers.  Albums like Reign in Blood and South of Heaven were masterpieces in my opinion (although they were mastered too tame.... to really enjoy those songs, you need to listen to the live Decade of Agression which is probably the best live album ever produced).  As for Metallica, despite my less-than-stellar opinion of them now, albums like Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning were amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why anyone would put Bon Jovi and metal in the same sentence is beyond me.  Other decent bands of that decade were Ozzy, Judas Priest, Sepultura, and Anthrax.  Of course, these people prove their cluelessness by including bands like Morbid Angel, Testament and Cannibal Corpse in their list of best 80's bands.  While I don't dispute the fact that a band making their debute in the late 80's should count (which Morbid Angel did), Cannibal Corpse didn't start producing stuff until the 90's.  Ah well... between picking bands from the wrong decade and picking hard rock/glam metal there are quite a few people that probably need their heads examined.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Duty Calls</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/duty-calls.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-18T08:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-06-18T08:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-06-18:/blog/duty-calls.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that people have let me know where that OpenSSL comic came from, I've been looking at &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/"&gt;xkcd.com&lt;/a&gt; more this morning and found one that is utterly priceless and totally reminds me of me.

&lt;p&gt;I'm using gmail to host my linsec.ca mail, and accessing it via POP3 (fetchmail-&amp;gt;procmail-&amp;gt;mutt).  When I send mail out, I send it out via gmail's SMTP server.  The problem is that I never see what I wrote.  If I send a message to a mailing list, I see replies to it, other messages, etc. but I have yet to actually see the message &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; wrote to the list.  I've poked around in the gmail settings but don't see anything relevant.  When I was hosting stuff myself, I obviously got my messages so this isn't a list setting... this is on all the lists I'm on.  It's quite frustrating as I'd like to get a copy back of the messages I send as I often have the (bad) habit of replying to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone come across this and figured out how to tell gmail to stop doing whatever it's doing with those messages?

&lt;p&gt;France was fun, so thank you again, Anne, for pushing to get me to go.  Very much appreciated.  Despite leaving my iPod in Anne's place, which made for the 8.5hr flight back from France to Toronto quite annoying (that and the kid who wouldn't shut up), I don't think I left anything else behind.  It was great to finally meet folks like fcrozat and blino... saw tvignaud once, I think, but didn't see him much more than that.  Got to meet Francois, and definitely had a blast with Anne, Erwan, and Oden.  Thanks again, Anne and Erwan, for putting up with Oden and I and taking us around to see stuff.  It was great to be able to check out stuff "live" that I would otherwise only see in the Davinci Code.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I have 2hrs to kill at the airport with only 57% battery and no plugins in site.  Oh well.  Not like I'm motivated to do much anyways... I was up at 6:30am Paris time (which is 10:30pm Edmonton time).  So, by the time I get home, it'll have been just under 24hrs (my plane lands at 9:10pm in Edmonton, so by the time I get my baggage and get home, it should be just after 10pm).  Talk about a long day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry Canada undertook a music file sharing study during 2006-07 to measure the extent to which music downloads over peer-to-peer file sharing networks, for which the sound recording industry receives no remuneration, affect music purchasing activity in Canada. The data used for this analysis are from a Decima Research survey conducted between April and June, 2006, on behalf of Industry Canada. The report, prepared by University of London researchers, Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz, found that music downloads have a positive effect on music purchases among Canadian downloaders but that there is no effect taken over the entire population aged 15 and over.&lt;/p&gt;

While I was in the know before most others due to vendor-sec, and was able to quickly verify this didn't affect Mandriva, the fallout still continues.  For those that think otherwise, this is a big issue, and a big mistake, and outlines some very important things about open source development.  First, &lt;a href="http://www.gergely.risko.hu/debian-dsa1571.en.html"&gt;this fellow&lt;/a&gt; thinks that the Debian OpenSSL maintainer should be changed, that the individual who caused this catastrophe should be booted as maintainer.  Honestly, he's probably right.  If this was something that happened in a corporate setting to affect the security of an individual company to the degree that this thing did, you know for fact that person would be canned within minutes.  Should we have more leeway just because it's open source and he's not being paid?  Frankly, if you're not good at cryptography and don't fully understand the code and aren't willing to work closely with upstream, you shouldn't be farting around with the package.  OpenSSL and other stuff like that is pretty major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was maintaining packages on Mandriva, I was the openssh maintainer.  I caught crap from Theo on a few occasions due to modifications Mandriva had made to openssh, despite the fact that I wasn't the one who made those changes.  As a result, this "header" has been in openssh's spec for the last seven years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
## Do not apply any unauthorized patches to this package!
## - vdanen 05/18/01
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I've not maintained openssh in quite a few years and it looks like the current/existing maintainers haven't been paying attention (or don't care) about that particular notice.  There are 8 patches to openssh, only 3 of which would be there if I were the maintainer.  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another scathing post to the OpenSSL issue, with some interesting comments, is on the Practical Technology blog, entitled &lt;a href="http://practical-tech.com/operating-system/linux/open-source-security-idiots/"&gt;Open-Source Security Idiots&lt;/a&gt;.  There are probably others, but I think two is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outlines one reason why I took the philosophy of "least-patching" when it came to Annvix.  The things that required patching usually had the patches submitted upstream for inclusion.  Some made it, some didn't.  I get there are some distro-specific features that authors won't want to incorporate.  For instance, svlogd would always log in UTC time which to me is useless... when I'm looking at logs and looking at dates, I'm looking for &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; time, not UTC time.  So I patched that.  But that's not how upstream wants it so, fine, that's one patch maintained by me.  But when it comes to big things, or things I don't understand, or crypto or security, etc. these things I deal with upstream and/or just plain old don't touch.  I'm not a C  or C++ expert, I'm not a cryptography specialist, and I won't pretend to be one.  If user X wants fancy feature Y in crypto package Z, well, they can deal with upstream to get it or provide something blessed by upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, take the recently-added blowfish support to glibc.  To add it to Mandriva was quite trivial as I've been using it on Annvix for years.  How does it work?  I have very little idea.  But I worked closely with Solar Designer of the Openwall GNU/Linux project to make sure it worked and worked properly in Annvix because it was needed for the TCB support I had added (and which I'll be adding to Mandriva shortly).  Now, Solar definitely knows about this stuff, so working with him to get it right helped.  Yeah, I suffered through being implied an idiot, but that's ok because I didn't come out to sound like any kind of expert.  Really, I'm just a glorified patch-monkey, not some deep-crypto-coder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my point is that it's important to work with upstream for this stuff as much a possible, and taking the path of least-patching makes good sense.  It avoids problems like this.  After all, you might be the "maintainer" of such-and-such software, but upstream is the author, and presumably understands and knows the code more than you.  This is another reason to send patches upstream.  If they're rejected, think about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they're rejected.  It might be for good cause.  You may also get the peer review to make the patch better; upstream won't always want to take your changes, but if there's something totally wrong with it, they'll let you know and maybe toss in a name or two for good measure.  But, really, that humiliation is better than this one... by no stretch of the imagination would I want to be Kurt Roeckx (the Debian openssl maintainer) right now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="openssl"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Watch out Mandriva...

I've been using some tools, like iurt, on the secteam buildbox for a while now, but I've not had the need to use repsys or mdvsys.  So I started playing with them yesterday.  For starters, someone needs to make rpm-build a dependency on repsys... it doesn't work too well without rpm-build (missing macros and such).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this morning I lost my virginity and used repsys and mdvsys to submit a new version of AIDE to cooker.  New version, and integrated the AIDE+gpg scripts from Annvix, so now AIDE is actually a good and trustworthy alternative to Tripwire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess now that I'm no longer working on Annvix there are a few things I should submit so I don't have to maintain them individually and outside of cooker/contrib.  Things like exim, execline, a better runit (although Mandriva's dietlibc is broken and runit doesn't build under dietlibc anymore which is a real shame)... there are a few others.  I'd like to submit rsec (the not-so-obnoxious alternative to msec), but somehow I think people would whine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also planning to import some stuff from Annvix that originally came from Openwall; stuff like tcb, pam_passwdqc, etc.  Of course, this will involve patching glibc and shadow-utils... possibly util-linux-ng, but I don't recall.  Of course, TCB is far superior to traditional shadow passwords and completely backwards compatible (with the patches, of course).  People will probably complain about that too, but whatever.  The patches don't force the use of TCB, but they do allow it to work.  The patches to glibc would incorporate blowfish password support, which is important.  Annvix, SUSE, and Openwall (and probably others) have had blowfish support for crypt for years.  Mandriva still doesn't.  Will probably hit resistance there too, but maybe I'll just submit it without telling anyone... that seems to be the "appropriate" way of doing things around here, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think we need to implement a spec "style" policy.  Good lord our specs are disgusting.  Functional, perhaps, but hideous to look at.  I now remember why I spent so much time and was so anal about formatting of specs in Annvix... it sure makes life simpler when every spec you follow uses the exact same style format.  I imagine Annvix wasn't the only distro with an anal style policy on specfiles... surely others must think that consistency in formatting saves time? &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="rpm"></category></entry><entry><title>zsh history</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/zsh-history.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-04-20T14:04:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-04-20T14:04:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-04-20:/blog/zsh-history.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Saw a few others on Planet Mandriva doing this so I figured what the heck, I'd do the same.

To put things into perspective, this machine will replace 3 different machines eventually... one to do the administrative stuff (AMD Athlon64 2.2GHz w/ 2GB RAM), one to build 32bit updates (dual core P4 3GHz w/ 1GB RAM), and one to do 64bit updates (AMD Athlon64 2GHz w/ 1GB RAM).  Yes... I've been working with those machines for quite a few years now.  Current kernel and OOo builds have definitely necessitated an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put things further into perspective, I compiled the Annvix kernel (2.6.22.19) on the two build machines and this new one (and also on my old trusty dual-opteron 1.8GHz w/ 2GB RAM that was my Annvix build machine... since I'm no longer working on Annvix, I was initially thinking of making that machine a new Mandriva updates build machine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 32bit build machine compiled it in 36:35.99m using 102% CPU.  The 64bit build machine did it in 28:15.13m using 97% CPU.  The dual-opteron did it in 23:47.04m with 152% CPU.  This new quad-core xeon did it in 12:01.66m with 229% CPU.  (Note that this is a single SMP kernel, not the multi-flavour kernels Mandriva builds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm absolutely tickled pink by this.  =)  This will definitely make secteam more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it also showed that 2008.1 will not boot on this system (at least with the 64bit Free DVD installer).  2008.0 had no problem booting and installing.  Unfortunately, doing my urpmi --auto-select to upgrade from 2008.0 to 2008.1, it also looks as though 2008.1's kernel is to blame... the system is not booting at all now.  =(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  using acpi=off makes it work, so the installer will run now (and the 2008.1 kernel boots, but the initrd is hosed giving the same error as 2008.0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT2:  using acpi=off works, my quad-core has turned into a single-core.  Definitely not cool.  And acpi=ht doesn't work... it hangs.  So according to &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingACPI"&gt;the Ubuntu wiki&lt;/a&gt;, this means that "the issue is in the ACPI table parsing code itself, or perhaps the SMP code".  Gustavo is telling me that there were some ACPI changes in 2.6.24, so that is most likely the culprit here.&lt;/p&gt;

Time to start gearing up for the barrage of bugfix updates.  =)  On a similar note, 2007.0 is almost EOL.. you've got a few days left to upgrade to something newer before being left without security updates.  April 13 is the day that 2007.0 support is terminated and 2007.1 goes into base/core update mode (essentially, all non-desktop-related stuff will get fixed, nothing else).  The product lifetime map is here:  &lt;a href="http://www.mandriva.com/en/security/productlifetime"&gt;http://www.mandriva.com/en/security/productlifetime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note...  using udev with mdadm sucks.  I don't know who changed it, but I had to reboot my sunfire about a dozen times yesterday to get it to boot properly... I have 7 md devices, and invariably on each boot, one or two would fail to assemble for some reason.  Poking around in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit, the md initialization was completely removed and I suspect udev is supposed to take care of it instead.  Well, after having to boot a dozen times to get the silly system up and running, I decided to put &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; the md initialization in rc.sysinit so that at least I know on subsequent reboots the system will actually come up fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the only downside I've seen so far is installation on a fully md system (everything is RAID1 -- /boot, swap, you name it).  Well, the installer is supposed to use LILO when /boot is a md device according to Pixel, but the installer doesn't actually install LILO, so you get bootloader install errors.  Booting into rescue mode and doing the grub install manually fixes the problem (but you have to do the full grub install as not even the grub support files are installed in /boot/grub and no menu.lst is generated either).  Then the system will come up.  Note to developers:  I've been using grub on fully-RAID1 systems for years.  You do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need LILO for this.  grub works just peachy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still something wonky with my menu.lst tho as installkernel fails to update menu.lst when installing a new kernel.  Not quite sure what the deal there is, seems like a pretty strange error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@hades servers]# installkernel 2.6.24.4-server-1mnb

&lt;p&gt;Switching my servers from Annvix to Mandriva is absolutely maddening.  The biggest problem is dynamic uid/gid mappings.  Do you know how frustrating it is to have apache uid 77 on one machine and uid 92 on another?  Or svn is gid 75 on one and gid 76 on another?  It's driving me absolutely bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why on earth we switched, years ago, from static uid/gid mapping to dynamic mapping is beyond me.  It's the most utterly retarded thing possible.  Consistency between different installs is not a bad thing people!  Sure, the original argument was "it keeps the passwd file smaller" but... news flash!  It's &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to specify the uid or gid in the spec file and it's trivial to keep a publicly-accessible list of the map so people don't grab inappropriate uid or gid numbers.  I mean, seriously... I implemented that in Annvix over 4 years ago!  It was one of the first things I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, mention this and developers/maintainers poo-poo the idea (no, that's not theoretical... after I did it Annvix I proposed it again and... gasp... it was poo-poo'd... like usual).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaaaahhh!  If I had a brick wall handy I'd be smashing my head in it at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

So I answered the 5-6 questions, stuff like "do you believe in God", "do you love God", "what kind of music do you listen to", "what are your hobbies"... of course, the guy who did the app can't spell so one strike against it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, at the end it tells you that you need to send invites to 12 people in order to see who you're most like.  No thanks... I'm not gonna spam people with that junk.  Anyways, back to my profile page and lo-and-behold there's this big red devil head on there and the bible character app is telling me that out of all the people in the bible, I'm most like Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I just kinda stared at it for a bit before removing the app (although the results stay on my page until they get shuffled off).  But... seriously... wtf?!?  Ok, I answered my favourite music was heavy metal but everything else pretty pro-God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm starting to think that quiz is rigged and there are only three answers... Jesus, Satan, and Moses.  I guess if I answered I listen to gospel music I'd be like Jesus, and if I listened to pop I'd be like Moses.  Oh wait... maybe pop would make me like Jesus (i.e. that Jesus Christ Superstar nonsense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally I find Facebook tolerable at best and don't think it's really worth mentioning, but this one really kinda cracked me up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Configure Snort to log packets to MySQL</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/configure-snort-to-log-packets-to-mysql.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-03-26T08:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2008-03-26T08:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-03-26:/blog/configure-snort-to-log-packets-to-mysql.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=184"&gt;Configure Snort to log packets to MySQL&lt;/a&gt; which looks at using MySQL to store snort logs and BASE to view them.

If you've been reading here for a while, you know that the machine I throw to the dogs is my Toshiba Libretto.  Asus may have a cute thing with the Eee PC, but I'll stick with my Libretto.  You'll also recall that with every release since I've had the Libretto, there is always something that needs to be tweaked or that just doesn't work out quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, 2008.1 works completely out-of-the-box.  X resolution is properly set, madwifi is properly setup, the SD card reader works.. everything just works.  The only thing I don't know about is the fingerprint scanner, but I'm not sure what we have for biometric packages, if anything (but I also haven't really looked beyond MCC because anything else would be a "hack").  Now, I haven't played with it extensively yet... today was a cooker upgrade from when I was bored one night a few weeks ago and had installed beta2 on it, but then never had the opportunity to play with it more.  So after a urpmi --auto-select, reboot, and some playing, I'm impressed.  Metisse was a little slow (but looked pretty sharp)... definitely wouldn't use it everyday but it makes for nice "check this out" factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE4 looks pretty nifty...  Tried to urpmi task-kde4 and got some conflicting files amongst various packages so didn't get everything installed, but it still runs well enough (I think I'm just missing some office-related stuff).  KDE3 looks... well.. the same.  So does GNOME, but in the case of GNOME that's ok because GNOME always looks sharp.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, as of right now, I'm impressed.  I've had to do exactly zero dickering to make everything (except the fingerprint reader) work.  Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real test will be the HP tablet, but that's going to run 2008 until 2008.1 is done as that's a production machine and the Libretto is my "road warrior" machine and since I'm plunked in this super-comfy chair all day and really only leave the house when I'm going stir crazy or need to buy coffee or water, it's ok if something breaks on that machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, congrats to the development team!  So far so good.  Sound works (I don't care about PulseAudio vs the other audio systems as much as some do.. I just care if it works), so that's a good thing too.  Will throw some mp3's and video files on there tomorrow to see how well the other apps work.  So, short of task-kde4 (which is in contribs, although that shouldn't be an excuse), everything is working great.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category></entry><entry><title>Microsoft and HD-DVD</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/microsoft-and-hd-dvd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-03-01T18:32:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-03-01T18:32:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-03-01:/blog/microsoft-and-hd-dvd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read this really eye-opening piece on the death of HD-DVD to Blu-ray, and Microsoft's stakes, involvement, and (typically) underhanded activity regarding it.

I didn't pay much attention to the next-gen hi-def "format wars" beyond the tech specs and features.  I knew that Microsoft was involved with HD-DVD, but I didn't realize the extent.  Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy am I glad that Blu-ray won out.  I actually didn't think they would, considering Sony has had failures with Beta and UMD (well, failures in terms of where they wanted those formats to go).  Seriously, Sony makes a killer gaming system (the PS2 is still incredible, and the PS3 is no shabby piece of hardware either).  But this time they did things right with Blu-ray.  I actually bent and got a PS3 a few months ago, not for any desire or want of Blu-ray, but simply for the games, now that there's some good titles to choose from (Heavenly Sword is freaking amazing!).  I don't think I would have regretted the purchase if HD-DVD won the "war", but the nice thing is now I can watch the winning format without ponying up for another player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, truth be told, when I was looking at standalone blu-ray players, I came to the conclusion that I may just buy another PS3 (probably for Christmas this year I think) to act as the "blu-ray" player of the house.

It's primarily a wiki of various security-related information and a mailing list for OSS vendors and authors to be able to discuss public security issues.  The concept is moderately similar to full-disclosure or bugtraq, but is aimed particularly at OSS vendors and authors.  Because of the sensitivity of some issues on vendor-sec (pre-disclosure issues, etc.) having a large number of people on vendor-sec isn't really viable, so oss-security aims to fill that gap by allowing those interested in security (and not necessarily members of vendor security teams) to discuss public issues, coordinate audits, or whatever.  The aim is to have a stronger OSS security community and to allow people with interest and expertise to get involved, without having to adhere to the strict "code" associated with vendor-sec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.openwall.com/"&gt;Openwall Project&lt;/a&gt; for offering to provide the infrastructure to host this thing.  The wiki is up at &lt;a href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/"&gt;oss-security.openwall.org&lt;/a&gt; and while it's still rather small at the moment, the hope is that various vendors and authors will get on board and provide the information we're looking for.  Particularly, the wiki is a place where people who have found a security issue in something or are want to figure out where, for example, Mandriva or SUSE advisories get posted, can easily do so.  It's mostly a dictionary of links right now, although I believe the goal is to have some "best practices" type information and other pertinent info to help vendors and such.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a bit of a quirky setup for Nagios where I run the local system checks on remote systems via netcat, ipsvd, and a script to handle the query.  This allows me to monitor remote drive space, current users, total processes, and current load.  Using hddtemp, I can now monitor the temperature of the drives in those machines (which also gives me an idea of how hot/cold the server room itself is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may need some tweaking to work with other Nagios setups, but shouldn't be too hard to adapt.  One of these days I'll do a writeup on my Nagios configuration.  Anyways, the wrapper script is as follows.  It could probably be optimized a bit more, but it works well enough.  Wordpress doesn't handle the indents very well, so keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

    echo "${0} -w [warn] -c [crit] [drives]"

while [ "${1}" != "" ]; do

    temp=`echo ${stats} | cut -d ':' -f 3 | cut -d ' ' -f 2`
    dev=`echo ${drive}|cut -d '/' -f 3`

    if [ "${temp}" -ge "${warn}" ]; then
        if [ "${status}" != "2" ]; then
            status=1
        fi
    fi

Took some time to figure it all out, but we were persistent and Gustavo came up with the fix for all supported libcdio versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't normally blog about the security stuff we do, so why is this different?  Well, this one was more interesting than your run-of-the-mill patch-test-release cycle.  We actually got to do some testing and fixing on our own which, while not a first for Mandriva, is certainly rare.  Usually we're the recipients of other people's patches.  This time, we found something, and we fixed it, got to submit it upstream, etc.  This might be a normal thing for maintainers, but not so normal for the secteam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I've always wanted to be able to have the resources to do more "research" in looking for vulns to fix things proactively.  This gave me a taste of it, and I like it.  =)  Too bad the resources aren't there to do more of this sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also nice seeing your name associated with upstream fixes.  The &lt;a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/index.php?6413"&gt;patch information&lt;/a&gt; gives Mandriva credit for the fix, which is great for us.  Also lets Gustavo puff his chest a bit with a job well-done.  My name is in there, but didn't need to be... I guess that's the benefits of being a middle-man/proxy/manager sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, it's back to the usual grind, but this was an interesting little side-track.  I guess the next "big thing" isn't so much package auditing, but is a departure from the normal grind... get to figure out how to setup and use iurt to build security updates.

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone use this domain-management feature in Google?  Does the premier edition handle &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; mailing lists, like mailman or something?  Without the mailing list support, is pretty much useless (sure, I have only one mailing list on linsec.ca, but if I'm going to move to this Google domains thingy, then I'd want to move annvix.org as well to be able to completely "outsource" the remaining email bits I'm running here... and annvix.org handles quite a few mailing lists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; HOWTOs out there?  Is this something quite difficult?  Anyone have any ideas how many man-hours this might take to accomplish and if there's a way to migrate the data from AD to OpenLDAP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using OpenLDAP for PAM-based authentication, and I have it setup on one samba server to use LDAP for auth, but couldn't make it work on a second one (although I didn't try very hard).  But I've never tried to do something like this.  Problem is they have about 30+ windows clients ranging from 98 to XP and everything in between, so a drop-in replacement for the AD server would be best.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, the real question then becomes what happens to AppArmor?  I suspect AppArmor will survive as a result of this, and Crispin will probably continue to work on it somewhat, although it may end up being more of a free-time project than anything else (of course, Novell owns AppArmor so they probably won't be giving it the boot anytime soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell should never have gotten rid of the ex-Immunix folks.  I guess Novell's loss is now Microsoft's gain.

Unfortunately, it's primarily a Windows environment.  It was 100% windows until I donated a linux server to handle their backups.  But now that the machine is in there, it opens the door to using and utilizing a number of web-based applications.  I already have mediawiki setup on the thing so that they can start utilizing it for notes and items to each other.  It will take some time for them to use this system, and be comfortable with it, but that's ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, right now they're looking into software to handle donations and receipts (because they are an independent school), and also some limited CRM capabilities; i.e. to have information on donors and the ability to quickly print out mailing labels based on certain criteria (i.e. did the person attend the golf tournament, did they donate in the last year, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest thing I've found so far is ChurchLedger, but my wife has played with it a bit and it's too geared to churches, and too complicated for her to use.  I'm trying to convince her (and, by proxy, the school) to use something open so that if, in 5 years, things go wrong or the developer of the app they're currently looking at dies, etc. that they have something easy to maintain and that anyone can look into.  Originally they wanted her to develop something in Access and were going to pay for courses for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions on something that could be used here, meeting the criteria of being able to print out donation receipts, mailing labels, perhaps some rudimentary bulk mailing feature, that is preferably written in PHP (or perl), and uses PostgreSQL or MySQL to store the data?  I had considered whipping up something on my own, but don't have the time right now to invest/donate something like that.  Any suggestions of potential candidates would be useful.  It has to be web-based as they're currently using windows on the desktop systems, but I'm hoping that will change over the next year or so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Use OpenNTPD for time synchronization</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/use-openntpd-for-time-synchronization.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-10T19:52:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-01-10T19:52:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-01-10:/blog/use-openntpd-for-time-synchronization.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail tip is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=153"&gt;Use OpenNTPD for time synchronization&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses using OpenNTPD (from the OpenSSH team) instead of the older (and more bloated) NPTD.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category></entry><entry><title>Where's the shareware?</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/wheres-the-shareware.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-09T21:55:00-07:00</published><updated>2008-01-09T21:55:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2008-01-09:/blog/wheres-the-shareware.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day of &lt;a href="http://www.macheist.com/"&gt;MacHeist 2&lt;/a&gt;, an event where you can get 10 shareware OS X applications for $49USD (all the apps regularly priced at $343.75USD).

That's a pretty spanking good deal.  This year's heist looks pretty good... last year's was better, but this year isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that got me thinking about shareware.  There are essentially three schools of software:  freeware, shareware, and commercial.  For the mac user, there's plenty of all three, same for the windows user.  It seems like, by and large, the Linux crowd is stuck with two: freeware (ala open source) and commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being no stranger to shareware, I was struck today as to why there is very little shareware for Linux.  We have an insane amount of "freeware" via open source software.  There's also plenty of commercial software... stuff like Oracle, VMware, and so forth come immediately to mind.  However, it seems to me like the commercial stuff is marketed directly to the enterprise sector, and the the freeware stuff is for everyone (everyone else?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appeals to mid- and large-sized business who want the reassurance of support and longevity; I get why commercial software exists.  It will always exist, whether you dream of a utopian all-open-source-society or not.  Open source (aka freeware) appeals to everyone.  When you think of the support options for open source, it's by and large community-based or DIY (do-it-yourself).  I can install a web application written in PHP and not worry if the developer takes off because I have the source (and the skills) to update and enhance it as I see fit.  As a result, I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; open source.  But I'm the average user your typical Linux distribution is trying to target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of shareware is strange.  When I look at the mac, knowing that a lot of the "guts" are open source applications, I see that right out of the box I get the commercial (the GUI interface and the apps Apple has written) and the open source (apache, PHP, perl, bash, etc. right there where I want it).  However, were I a newcomer to the mac, would I immediately be looking for the open source stuff?  The commercial stuff?  The average person would be looking for the shareware and would wander over to places like &lt;a href="http://www.macupdate.com"&gt;MacUpdate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/"&gt;VersionTracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as a newcomer to Linux, there is nothing like that for me.  There are probably, what, less than one hundred shareware applications for Linux?  Maybe two hundred?  Quite possibly a lot less than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about a mac, and the software you use on it, you're thinking about some high quality applications.  Yet most of those are shareware.  Now, I'm not saying Linux is lacking in high quality applications -- there is some damn fine open source stuff out there.  But, coming from a windows or mac background, I dare say most of that isn't desktop applications.  The really solid stuff is the server-related stuff (samba, apache, perl, etc.).  Some really good desktop applications exist, sure... Firefox and Thunderbird are nothing to shake your head at, and KDE and GNOME are good desktop interfaces.  But what if I wanted a good RSS reader?  Or a file manager?  Or something like a really slick CSS editor?  On Linux, I'm stuck with the open source; on a mac or windows, if the open source stuff available doesn't cut it, I have options (shareware and commercial).  This makes me think back to the "choice is good" mantra that comes with distributions shipping a dozen different text editors.  If there is a half-dozen so-so RSS readers, and I happen to dislike or have issues with all of them, where then is my choice?  Do I even have the option to look for something that costs a few dollars, where the developer has more than just "warm fuzzies" as motivation?  (This motivation, BTW, makes some insane things happen... money is one of the best motivators a person can get).  If we don't have that middle-tier of application development (shareware), do we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have all the choice we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the zealotry behind "everything open source" is coming to bite us in the arse and scare off shareware developers.  After all, it used to be that if you ran Linux, the perception was "free free free!".  Everything must be free.  For someone to develop a quality piece of software and then ask for money, or make it available and cripple it until it was registered, I'm sure they'd be attacked by a virtual mob ready to kick them in the face.  Why?  Because this is open source, dammit!  Your greedy mentality isn't wanted here!  Yeah, I'd yell some more, but I have to call the Oracle support staff regarding a problem with our Oracle database we were alerted to.  Down with the greedy shareware authors!  If you're going to write something, make it open source!  Yes?  Hello?  Oracle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm well aware that for the last couple of years advocates have been proclaiming that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; year would be the year of the Linux desktop.  And every year it isn't.  Every year the desktops do amazing things, don't get me wrong, so one has to wonder where the short end of the stick lies.  Is it the kernel and hardware support?  Lack of popular games?  Not enough polish on the desktop interface?  We've all heard the varied excuses as to why it wasn't the time, or what needs weren't met, etc.  Sure, some of it is definitely true, but some of it is bunk.  Not enough desktop polish?  GNOME has a great interface... there's a lot of polish there.  It works and works well (I'm not a big fan of KDE, but I suspect it's in the same camp).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm seriously wondering if all the "free free free!" foaming at the mouth has driven off a developer community that is moderately or even purely motivated by profit, but don't have the resources to be "commercial software developers".  A lot of this really great mac software is developed by single individuals or small teams and they produce some high class stuff.  And the funny thing... OS X is not very old, in the grand scheme of things.  Linux has been around longer than OS X has.  Yes, Apple's control over the interface and hardware, the applications Apple has written, aggressive advertising, etc. have definitely helped propel OS X along to the point that it's making more of a dent now in Windows sales than it ever has in the past.  But there is still fundamental cost associated with it that Linux users can avoid.  Having said that, it's the developer community that drives Apple, and Apple makes sure (for the most part) to seriously acknowledge and foster that community.  Without all of those third-party shareware applications, the mac isn't much to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a great open source development community around us.  But can Linux really take on Apple and Microsoft with just a two-tiered development community?  When the two operating systems that are the biggest competition both have large three-tiered development communities?  Have we so focused on one camp to the almost complete exclusion of another that it can never come back?  If shareware developers started developing shareware for Linux, would people even buy it?  Or would the mantra of "free free free!" drive them, and their software, away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know.  I'm not a marketing guy.  But it's something to consider.  Especially in light of events like MacHeist where in less than 24hrs, as of this moment, there have been 2648 bundles sold.  This, and the fact that there is so much shareware available for the mac, tell me that shareware as a concept is extremely viable.  I couldn't even begin to count how much I've spent on shareware applications for DOS, OS/2, Windows, and more recently OS X.  For 15+ years now I've been buying shareware.  Sure, not all shareware is great (or even good -- the motivation of money does not a good developer make), but the nice thing with it is you can try before you buy.  If it doesn't do it for you, don't buy it.  I've spent some hard-earned dollars on some fantastic software developed by very small companies and individuals, and I don't see myself stopping.  I've bought commercial software, but where a shareware solution existed that did as much, or close to as much, as a commercial offering, I've usually gone for the shareware stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Linux, I can count what I've paid for (other than operating systems (yes, I've bought boxed copies of Mandriva, SUSE, Yellowdog, etc.)) on one hand.  I've bought Zend Studio, and I've bought VMware.  Oh, and Komodo.  All of those were commercial software, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just food for thought.  I'm musing here, but I wonder if our two-tiered development community is what's making Linux trip on it's own feet when the Mac has a three-tiered development community and increases market share every year and Windows has the same three-tiered community and, while it's market share may be (arguably) slightly on the decline, surely it isn't enough for anyone to cheer over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... does Linux need shareware to compete?  And if does, will the open source purists and zealots even permit that middle-tier development community to survive, much less thrive?&lt;/p&gt;

I do.  Had to do it a few times...  no longer, but it makes for a nice nostalgic title so let's just go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was my first day "back" after three weeks of holidays.  It was definitely a nice three weeks... went by too fast, as all things do, of course.  Some nice and interesting things happened over the course of those three weeks, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week I spent some time setting up a server to donate to the school my daughter goes to and my wife is the secretary at (Faith Lutheran School).  It's a decent system, AMD64 3200+, 2GB RAM, dual 250GB HDDs in a 3U rack case.  Installed Annvix on it to be a headless backup/subversion system; what it does is mounts a samba share to their Windows domain controller (which is also their file server) and then does daily rsyncs of the data on that share to the local system and then commits those changes to a subversion repository.  Very slick, works well, and is a headless system.  Access is available to it via samba and ViewVC.  The possibility of it doing more in the future is real also (I'm thinking internal wiki, custom MySQL-based mailing database (they still think they want to send my wife on a course to learn MS Access... I'd be laughing very hard if I wasn't the one she'd be pestering with questions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was the first week.  The second and third weeks the girls had off as well, so we were all home and of course that falls with Christmas.  So Christmas Eve we spent at home doing our own thing, spoiling our daughter as usual.  Christmas Day we're at the in-laws with far too many people (my sister-in-law figured it would be nice to invite her boyfriend's daughter and her boyfriend as well), then we have the aunt and uncle also, and a friend from my mother-in-law's work... not to mention the two grandparents, my wife and her two sisters and brother, her sister's sons, and one sister's husband (the other has the aforementioned boyfriend with kids).  All in all, a full house and plenty noisy.  Lots of avoidance and Guitar Hero that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, Boxing Day, we do Christmas at our place for my side of the family, largely because that happens to also by my dad's birthday.  Much quieter (well, much less people... my nephew is one, my daughter is six, and my brother's daughter is 12 so there's a definite range of noise anyways).  Luckily, I have one brother and that's it, so the family size is much smaller.  It was pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week I had planned on "resting"... you know, doing a whole lot of nothing, reading my new Bourne books I got, however on the Thursday after we ended up at the SPCA just going to "check out" the kittens (we've been discussing a new kitten for a few months now as for the last year we've only had one cat (we had 3 cats a few years ago).  Well, my daughter fell in love with one and we brought him home under the mistaken impression he was a quiet cat.  Well, he was quiet for the first day.  Not a peep out of him.  Then he gets comfortable and you can't make the little thing shut up.  Oh well, he's black, he's 4mos old, he's cute, has definite spunk, and is totally attached to my daughter.  So she made a good choice.  My cat, on the other hand (who is 15.5 years old) is still not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, not much else happened.  I did manage to pick up a copy of Rock Band last week Wed or Thurs, can't recall which, but my observations on that are fodder for a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, definitely a nice holiday.  A little disappointing to come back and see the increase of the workload that needs to be dealt with, but such is life.  If nothing else, there's plenty to keep me busy until this stinking cold leaves, and there's not much to do outside other than to shovel snow to distract me, so I should be pretty productive over the next little while, not lacking for anything to do.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Annvix 3.0-RELEASE released</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/annvix-30-release-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-12-30T16:28:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-12-30T16:28:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-12-30:/blog/annvix-30-release-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just finished releasing &lt;a href="http://blog.annvix.org/index.php?/archives/93-Annvix-3.0-RELEASE-Freya-now-available.html"&gt;Annvix 3.0-RELEASE&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, &lt;a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com/5100-1035-6142224.html"&gt;Automate configuration backups with subversion&lt;/a&gt; is a quick way to use subversion to track configuration file changes.  It can be retro-fitted to work with anything really, but the sample is for committing and tracking changes to /etc/ in subversion.  I use it on all of my servers; it's awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another subversion-related tip is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=73"&gt;Automate subversion backups&lt;/a&gt; which goes into handling automatic backups of subversion repositories.  Having experienced subversion corruption (once only, thankfully), I find this is a great way to ensure you have a working backup of subversion at all times.  It's a little brief, but does the job.  I've expanded on that to also dump single commits every time they're made so you have an outside-of-svn-constant-backup of stuff that can be used to reconstruct the svn repository easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me knows that I'm overly cautious and almost anal when it comes to backups of stuff.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="subversion"></category></entry><entry><title>Filter for unwanted mail and mailing lists with procmail</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/filter-for-unwanted-mail-and-mailing-lists-with-procmail.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-12-18T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-12-18T12:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-12-18:/blog/filter-for-unwanted-mail-and-mailing-lists-with-procmail.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechRepublic tip is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=148"&gt;Filter for unwanted mail and mailing lists with procmail&lt;/a&gt;, which goes into procmail recipes a little more in depth than last week's tip (size restraints on these tips sucks sometimes, so we end up with two-parters).

&lt;p&gt;Good morning.  I'm writing this morning to express my views on this new
proposed copyright law as noted here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071127.WBcyberia20071127170629/WBStory/WBcyberia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely disgusting and I find it insulting that Canadians
should have to follow the mess that America has made of DRM.  May I
remind you that we pay a levy on all recordable media to allow us the
freedom to make backups for personal use?  What happened to the concept
of fair use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was proud to be Canadian knowing that the garbage the RIAA was pulling
in the US would not come north of the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find it ridiculous in the extreme that the Canadian government
would put the concerns of big business (especially &lt;em&gt;foreign&lt;/em&gt; big
business) before the concerns of the Canadian public.  May I remind you
all that the Canadian government is elected by the &lt;em&gt;Canadian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;
and not by corrupt and greedy corporations, particularly those not even
based in this country?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that very little of the levy has actually reached
Canadian artists, if any at all.  That mismanagement of tax should not
be an excuse to ratify some obscene bill to appease greedy corporate
America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, and I know many of my fellow Canadians, appreciate the freedoms we
have as Canadians.  Please think twice before you turn this country into
the same digital-rights-sewer that is currently the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

I always like these kinds of articles because too many people assume that all you can do is code.  Well, development is good, but there are a whole host of other things that can be done too.  His list, in short, is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use popular open-source software (even if you're not using Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure open source is considered as an option when your business specifies new systems (obviously this is applicable to very few people -- not too many people have the clout in their workplace to make sure &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; is an option)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join online open-source discussion forums (mailing lists are good here too)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to code (well, learning is ok... what you do with it is what matters and this is no more helpful to open source as it is to proprietary source)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help document and debug (this is essential, I think -- for myself, I'm not much of a programmer, but I do have some mad documentation skills that have been put into effect many times)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to open source events (this is good -- show support when you can and as often as you can, and face-to-face real-life support is much more meaningful than some online poll)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put your money where your mouth is (this also is very important, and too many people figure because something is open source that no money should be or needs to be involved...  but open source developers need to eat just as much as the proprietary guys do)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look around for other ways to use the open-source model (he notes wikipedia here, and while this is an interesting idea, I'm not too sure on the practicality of it, or how contributing to wikipedia helps, say, the apache or php or kernel developers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report bugs -- don't just complain about them (this is more important than most people realize... if you whine about a problem and never report it, how is it supposed to get fixed?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think things through, and be honest (I think he should have stayed with "9 things"... this one is a bit hokey, but ok)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, some of these ideas are new (but wierd) and some of them are old and just as relevant (and requiring reminding as the whole OSS steamboat chugs forward picking up new folks every day) today as they were 8-9 years ago when I started getting involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Sicko Film</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/sicko.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-28T01:24:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-11-28T01:24:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-11-28:/blog/sicko.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little late to the party here, but I just finished watching Sicko, a film by Michael Moore.

I sincerely thank God that a) I'm a pretty healthy individual (lack of exercise and such aside) and b) that I live in Canada.  I don't think I've ever been so grateful to be Canadian until I saw that.  People complain about long waits and what-have-you with the Canadian health-care system and it's true to some extent but to be honest, I don't know of anyone who has died here because of a long wait.  When my dad was diagnosed with colo-rectal cancer, he was in treatment almost immediately.  The only reason he didn't have surgery sooner was due to the fact that they wanted the radiation and chemo treatments to shrink the tumor before the operation.  But the time it took for the family doctor to think there was a problem to him seeing a specialist to him starting treatment was the matter of a few short weeks (2-3 I believe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother-in-law with lung cancer was dealt with very quickly.  Her recent hip-replacement surgery was dealt with quickly.  There was no months of waiting for either surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look at that film and know for fact that if I lived in the US, I'd be under a monumental pile of debt right now simply due to when my daughter was born.  We spent a week in the hospital because she had fluid in her lungs and was unable to breathe properly.  As it stands now, any debt I have is of my own making and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; due to medical expenses.  My parents would probably be living in my basement with the surgeries my dad has gone through for his cancer and after that a heart issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it ridiculous in the extreme that a country as wealthy as the US treats their people so poorly and that corporate greed outweighs the rights of the "little people" and that the government who is supposedly in place to &lt;em&gt;serve&lt;/em&gt; people is actually abusing them by allowing this kind of thing to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup, I'm damn proud to be Canadian.  I'll pay my $88/mo for my Alberta Healthcare premium (which covers me, my wife, and my daughter) -- gladly. And I'll pay my recordable media tax too -- we all know what goodness that affords my music habit.  All joking aside, I think this has solidified and already solid belief that no one (sorry, Google) can pay me enough to work for them if it means relocating to the US.

&lt;p&gt;On a side note, I've found that in some ways GH3 is both easier and harder than previous GH games.  I also found that I much prefer the layout and whatnot of GH3 to the previous games.  Oh, and the newer guitars are much better than the older ones.  Tried playing GH2 on PS2 yesterday and I sucked more on it than I do on GH2 on xbox360.  Dunno if it's the guitars themselves or how it shows on the screen (graphics look kinda sucky, and there's a definite lag and the calibration seems to have made it better but not perfect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Cowboys from Hell on the first Guitar Hero is still the only song I've not gotten 5 stars on in medium.  Yeah, I'm not so good I can play stuff on hard/expert very well (hard I'm actually doing moderately ok at in that I'm half-way thru it, but with average 3 stars per song -- expert is out of the question).  Dang Pantera!  Although, I honestly suspect that if they made Cowboys from Hell downloadable for GH2 or GH3, I might get my 5 stars... hammer-on's I find are dang-near impossible on the first GH.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Secure Connections to PostgreSQL</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/secure-connections-to-postgresql.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-20T18:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-11-20T18:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-11-20:/blog/secure-connections-to-postgresql.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=137"&gt;Secure Connections to PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; which goes a little bit into the many different possible authentication methods you can use with the PostgreSQL database server, how it differs from MySQL, and illustrates why, at least from a security standpoint, I much prefer PostgreSQL (although I don't say …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=137"&gt;Secure Connections to PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; which goes a little bit into the many different possible authentication methods you can use with the PostgreSQL database server, how it differs from MySQL, and illustrates why, at least from a security standpoint, I much prefer PostgreSQL (although I don't say that since I try not to show prejudice in technical articles).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="postgresql"></category></entry><entry><title>Specify who can log in via OpenSSH</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/specify-who-can-log-in-via-openssh.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-18T20:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-11-18T20:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-11-18:/blog/specify-who-can-log-in-via-openssh.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another Techrepublic tip is up, entitled &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=132"&gt;Specify who can log in via OpenSSH&lt;/a&gt;.

I can honestly say it's extremely "wow".  It's got a slick interface to configuring things like DNS, DHCP, apache, Open Directory (which is essentially OpenLDAP+Kerberos) and some other goodies.  All wrapped up in a nice GUI interface (I've never seen Apache so nice to configure before).  Extremely slick.  Very cool stuff.  I could easily replace my Annvix-based LAN server with this puppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it's expensive.  I mean &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; expensive, for someone like me.  I've got a few machines here, and a whole pile of virtual machines.  My LAN server runs DHCP, DNS, OpenLDAP, Samba... lots of stuff.  I've got cross-system backups, LDAP-based authentication, NFS exports and auto-mounting.  Webservers, MySQL and PostgreSQL servers scattered around... wikis, blogs... you name it.  I've got a lot of stuff going on here.  OS X server could definitely simplify a few of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, at a 10-client license (that's 10 concurrent file-sharing connections, which is enough for me), I'm looking at about $500.  That in itself isn't such a bad price.  The problem is you need a machine capable of running it.  Ideally, that would be an &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/canadastore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=7E50163B&amp;amp;nclm=Xserve"&gt;Xserve&lt;/a&gt;, but starting at $3499CAD, that's expensive.  Sure, it comes with OS X server (web page says 10.4 server... I wonder if that's a typeo... must be).  It's not a bad configuration either: 2 64bit dual-core Xeon processors, 1GB RAM, and a single 80GB SATA HDD.  All wrapped up in a nice 1U machine -- perfect for my rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here though is that it would need more RAM and new HDDs... let's face it, Apple could keep the 80GB drive.  I'd want that puppy loaded with 3 500GB drives.  And a minimum of 2GB RAM, but probably more.  All of a sudden I'm over $6000CAD if I bought the stuff through Apple (with 750GB drives instead of 500GB drives).  That's a half-decent used car around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but a similar spec'd opteron-based system from Sun is quite a bit cheaper.  I could get a Sun Fire X4100 M2 with dual opteron processors (dual-core I believe) with 4GB RAM and 4 SATA drive capability for just over $5000CAD.  Or go with a trusty Sun Fire X2100 with a single dual-core opteron, 4GB RAM for $2000CAD (and let me tell you, those Sun Fire X2100's are impressive... I have one and love it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Apple doesn't give you a choice of a "lower-end" machine, you're stuck with the quad-core xeon... not necessarily a bad thing but if all you're going to be doing is providing room for backups and file sharing, LDAP authentication, DNS and DHCP, and an intranet website, the price tag is hefty.  The geek in me would want the Sun Fire X4100, but the practical person in me knows an X2100 would be more than sufficient.  And then I could toss Annvix or Mandriva on there and have the OS for no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I have a powermac G5 that is capable of running Leopard Server -- it would cost me $500 to get it up and running with no other hardware cost.  But my concern is that if/when that machine dies, what then?  That G5 has a few months of AppleCare left, sure, but after that it's anyone's guess how long it'll last.  Probably quite a few years yet, but there's no guarantee.  By using Annvix or Mandriva, if my LAN server dies, I can buy a low-end X2100 and replace it with little cost.  If I used 10.5 server on my G5 and it died, I'm looking at about $6000 just to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the geek in me would love to get my hands on and play with Leopard Server and use it for my LAN server, the practical person in me thinks it's too much risk.  At least with the consumer desktops it's no so bad... if my macbook dies, the replacement cost after 3 years is reasonable.  But would you really want to run an iMac as a server?  I could go for a mini I guess, and it probably has enough juice to actually perform all the tasks it would need to perform... reasonably.  Replacement cost for it wouldn't be so bad, at least compared to an xserve (and it would fit in my rack reasonably well too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the bottom line is that Apple has a spanking nice product with Leopard Server, and the xserve is entirely too cool.  But for the average guy, the cost just doesn't justify it.  My Annvix box can do everything that Leopard Server can with a little bit of effort (and I stress little)... it just doesn't look as cool and you're stuck with the CLI (which, in my opinion, is great).  And the cost is extremely reasonable.  I suppose this is the same argument for Linux vs Windows servers except with Windows you pay through the nose for licensing, but can largely run it on anything you want.  With Apple, the pricing is quite reasonable for the software, but you get nailed with the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fun and interesting 20 minutes, I'll give it that, but I have no (practical) desire to spend more than that on it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Define disk quotas to keep users from hogging drive space</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/define-disk-quotas-to-keep-users-from-hogging-drive-space.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-06T13:34:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-11-06T13:34:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-11-06:/blog/define-disk-quotas-to-keep-users-from-hogging-drive-space.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=130"&gt;Define disk quotas to keep users from hogging drive space&lt;/a&gt;.

Sorry, it's so new and there's some cool features in it.  Like AutoFS finally working (more or less) properly out of the box.  It works, but the NFS exports need to be exported to the server with the "insecure" option.  I don't like that very much, but that's the only way it currently works.  Some sites I've looked at recommend doing something like this in /etc/exports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
/mnt/export *(rw,insecure,no_root_squash)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's absolutely horrifying.  For one, there's no real reason to have no_root_squash.  For two, you didn't &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; want to export everything like that, right?  Best have some IP restrictions in there or something.  I'd use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
/mnt/export odin(rw,insecure)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead.  Replace "odin" with an IP address if you don't use DNS (I have my own DNS domain for my LAN simply due to all the machines and virtual machines here).  Then you can poke around, on the leopard box, in /net/foo/mnt/export to get all your files, without any additional configuration on the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, /net is a "hidden" directory, so it won't show up in the Finder, and there's nothing in the sidebar about the connected servers, which sucks.  PathFinder is worse tho... if you navigate to /net (by telling it to show invisibles), all of a sudden every share shows up as mounted in the PathFinder sidebar.  Ouch!  To make life easier, you may want to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cd ~
$ ln -s /net .
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can navigate it in the Finder via ~/net/.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Authentication caching with nscd</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/authentication-caching-with-nscd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-30T16:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-30T16:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-10-30:/blog/authentication-caching-with-nscd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechMail tip is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=127"&gt;Authentication caching with nscd&lt;/a&gt; which talks about how to keep authentication credentials cached for disconnected operations (i.e. if you auth against an LDAP server and it goes down or you take your laptop home).&lt;/p&gt;

Which makes Safari almost useless, although I did find in the History menu bar the option "Reopen All Windows From Last Session".  Well, thanks for making a half-assed attempt there... no quick key shortcut, no option to make that the default behaviour in the preferences... nothing.  Utterly lame.  And without Saft to automate that for me, Safari looks less and less appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, now I've decided to do an impromptu benchmark (in terms of memory and CPU utilization when idle) of Camino, Safari, and OmniWeb.  I had settled on using Camino as the default browser, but now I'm not so sure.With the same 14 tabs open in each browser, Camino is idling at 21.9% CPU, 23 threads, and 143.43MB of real memory.  Safari on the other hand is utilizing 0.5% CPU, 14 threads, and 149.12MB memory.  OmniWeb is using 0.6% CPU, 25 threads, and 178.87MB memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno... the memory usage is roughly the same across the board, but the CPU usage while idling makes me think Safari or OmniWeb.  I like the fact that Safari is using less memory but.. well, with 7GB of RAM I can afford to be excessive.  =)  Both load pages with relatively the same speed it feels like, so I think that OmniWeb with it's much superior session features will be the default for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>OS X 10.5... installs and thoughts</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/os-x-105-installs-and-thoughts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-28T21:02:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-28T21:02:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-10-28:/blog/os-x-105-installs-and-thoughts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I did my duty on Friday and went out and grabbed a copy of OS X 10.5 (Leopard).

As I was finishing my SuperDuper backups, I was poking around on Apple's support forums and heard about all the horror stories people have had.  Two essential apps for me, DayLite and FileMaker, didn't have Leopard-aware updates at the time; FileMaker won't apparently until sometime next month and DayLite has a beta available now.  Apparently, only a few minor things are wrong with FileMaker that are, for me easily circumvented (change the region from Canada to USA and I was up and running).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why so many people were having problems.  I suppose most of them either do an upgrade or archive/install.  I do neither.  I use SuperDuper to make an exact clone of my drives, then do a complete fresh install.  Yeah, it's more time-consuming to re-install everything, copy preferences and other associated data over, etc. but you know what?  It's dang-near fool-proof.  I've done three machines so far, and all three are up and running just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial observations are that 10.5 seems a lot faster.  Now, my desktop is no slouch... it's a 2.66GHz quad-core xeon Mac Pro with 7GB of RAM (the rationale for the RAM is VMware).  Whether this is due to 10.5 itself or the fact that a whole bunch of crap I had installed before that I no longer have installed (because I don't use it, forgot to uninstall it before, whatever) -- it remains to be seen if the system will feel faster 6mos from now or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few issues I had read about.  Keychains were a big item on the Apple forums.  Pretty simple tho.  Copy the old keychain (say, vdanen.keychain) from the backup to ~/Library/Keychains/.  Open Keychain Access, add the keychain, then set it to be the default keychain.  Voila, instant pre-upgrade keychain support.  Not sure why so many people were having problems with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copying relevant files from ~/Library/Preferences/ and ~/Library/Application Support/ took some time, but the preference files are pretty well named (for the most part).  Whatever I missed before (easy to tell when you launch an app), I simply copied over after closing the app.  Re-launch, and back to pre-upgrade settings.  Don't forget /Library/Application Support/ and /Library/Preferences/ too, for the system-wide stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All applications seem to be working pretty good, with the FileMaker caveat I noted before.  PathFinder seems a little sensitive and has crashed on me twice now.  Everything else seems fairly solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaces is slick.  Could be better, could also be a whole lot worse.  I like it.  The new Terminal completely rocks.  I love the tabbed support, the Window Group support, and the themes.  The preferences are also laid out in a more sane manner now.  Totally impressed with it and have no need to use iTerm anymore.  (Hint: for those who use mutt in the Terminal, Osaka-Mono 13pt is an awesome font to use (14pt, depending on your screen size and how large you like stuff... it's in with the Additional Fonts package so make sure you install it (I believe it's supposed to be a japanese font of some sort).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutt compiled fine, fink works.  Irssi I had to compile without perl support... there doesn't seem to be any perl development files installed, which is odd.  Not sure if Tiger came with them installed, or if I obtained them via ActivePerl or fink or something, but a few pretty important header files were missing.  I hadn't realized that subversion came bundled, so now I have svn in both /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin; not a huge deal tho.  Oh wierd.  I just realized that the perl header files are in /System/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/.  Sometimes the OS X way of placing files wierds me out.  What's wrong with /usr/include?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ssh is interesting... a dialog box pops up and asks for your ssh key passphrase and offers to add it to the keychain.  This may allow me to get rid of SSHKeychain which, while being a decent app, had the nerve to start sucking up massive amounts of CPU every once in a while... a bug that's persisted across multiple versions.  I won't mind if it's gone, although I need to look into things a bit more as I'd like to know how it's handling ssh-agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it feels pretty much the same.  The new dock is cute.. it's so small on my machine that I only use it to note what apps are open; I never actually use it to launch anything (LaunchBar is way too cool not to use it).  Time Machine looks interesting, although the drive I plan to use it on has my SuperDuper clone on it right now so I haven't played with it much.  The Stacks stuff looks... different.  Can't really see myself using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Finder is really cool.  If it had tab support, I could probably replace Path Finder with it completely.  I like the remote share browser, that seems to be working quite well although I haven't tried screen sharing yet.  Also seems a lot snappier than the Tiger Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I'll find other issues and cool things over the weeks to come.  Personally, I'm waiting for a new version of Saft to come out.  The new Safari seems pretty much like the old one to me.  It's ok, and has been my default browser for a long time.  I forgot how useless it was without Saft tho.  Hello... Apple?  Saving browser window sessions?  This is an absolute must!  If I have 10 sites open, I want those 10 same sites &lt;i&gt;back&lt;/i&gt; if I have to reboot, or if Safari crashes, or whatever.  I don't want to start with a new blank window.  Sheesh.  Using Camino right now for the day-to-day browsing until Saft gets updated.  I prefer the look of Safari (doesn't feel so "alien") to Camino (which is pretty good, but the clickable buttons look off), or Firefox (which is as alien as it gets).  New version of OmniWeb out tho, so maybe I'll see if the stability issues in previous versions has been worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it doesn't seem to bad to me.  I don't get what all the fuss is, but I guess with all these new Windows converts and other Mac users that seem to think Apple is "all that" but still don't have any technical clue, there are a few who would have issues.  For me, other than having stuff in weird locations, it's no different than a Linux install (yup...  unless it's Annvix, it's &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; a fresh install).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Guitar Hero III... early?</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/guitar-hero-iii-early.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-24T00:53:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-24T00:53:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-10-24:/blog/guitar-hero-iii-early.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to most gaming sites, Guitar Hero III is supposed to be released on October 28th.

Either it got pushed forward, or I lucked out and my local Walmart screwed up big because when I was out buying picture frames, I decided to see if Conan (which was supposed to be released today) had come out... lo and behold, I walked out of Walmart with the single copy of Guitar Hero III they had on the shelves.  I presume they had more copies and sold them already, but I don't know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, on medium difficulty I'm ranked 104 of 184... and it was 182 earlier this evening so I'm presuming that more copies either got mistakenly sold a week early or it's already out (but since I didn't see it any other stores I looked at today to get Conan, I think someone let it go early).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should probably be finished it tomorrow... too tired to play more tonight.  Definitely has some cool songs tho.  =)  Guitar Hero II is still selling like crazy tho... on the 18th there were 898243 users on the leaderboards (at which point I was ranked 119207), and as of the 21st, which was the last time I checked the leaderboards, I was ranked 115949 of 908952.  Gotta keep track of these scores somehow and the blog seems like the best place to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I have a receipt to prove I actually did &lt;b&gt;buy&lt;/b&gt; it from Walmart tonight, before anyone starts thinking I downloaded  it or something stupid like that.  Kinda ticked that I didn't walk away with Conan, but I'll take Guitar Hero III... for now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Configure GNU Screen to handle multiple terminals</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/configure-gnu-screen-to-handle-multiple-terminals.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-23T11:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-23T11:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-10-23:/blog/configure-gnu-screen-to-handle-multiple-terminals.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's TechRepublic tip is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=124&amp;tag=nl.e011"&gt;Configure GNU Screen to handle multiple terminals&lt;/a&gt;.

I suppose that's the creative license that having a blog entitles people, but it still irks me because in a lot of cases it's completely unfounded and could easily be cleared up with a simple email question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wandering around and found &lt;a href="http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/21155"&gt;Battle of the Titans: Mandriva 2008 vs OpenSUSE 10.3&lt;/a&gt;.  Interesting read; I like how Mandriva comes out on top although there are definitely areas we can improve upon.  But what else is new? &lt;b&gt;Every&lt;/b&gt; distro has areas that can be improved upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, in the comments I'm reading: "the sad part is an unexpected secrecy in Mandriva", which refers to a bug aliased as CVE-2007-2834, for which the individual didn't have access to. Of course, he starts a FUD-based tirade on his own blog &lt;a href="http://beranger.org/index.php?page=diary&amp;2007/10/19/12/33/32-starting-from-susan-s-mandriva-v"&gt;Planete Beranger&lt;/a&gt;.  And this is where the fun begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, Beranger decides to go on a tirade about hidden bug reports.  Good thing Adam is around to smack some sense into him (I'm assuming Beranger is a him, but I don't really know).  He has some nice nuggets like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anyway, the sad part is an unexpected secrecy with Mandriva: try a search for http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-2834 and you will get a blunt:
You are not authorized to access bug #33759.

Huh?!

And indeed, the access to http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=33759 is denied!

I very much dislike this huge blunder from Mandriva's part: are they trying to play Microsoft, or what?! Hiding bug reports is unacceptable!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm...  well, if he would have bothered to ask anyone, he would have had his answer fairly quickly as to what the deal with that report is.  The contents of this bug report is, exactly:&lt;/p&gt;

Integer overflow in the TIFF parser in OpenOffice.org (OOo) before 2.3
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a TIFF file with
crafted values of unspecified length fields, which triggers allocation
of an incorrect amount of memory, resulting in a heap-based buffer
overflow.

Fixed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty spicy stuff, no?  In fact, if you looked it up on &lt;a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2834"&gt;MITRE's website, entry CVE-2007-2834&lt;/a&gt; you'll see the same thing (minus the "Fixed" comment).  In fact, you'll see more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and lookee here, you'll also see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
MANDRIVA:MDKSA-2007:186
URL:http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2007:186
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what happens when you follow that link?  Well, you get to see that it was fixed in CS3, 2007.0, and 2007.1.  Doesn't indicate 2008, of course, because it was fixed when 2008 was cooker, thanks to this (public) report: &lt;a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=33824"&gt;Bugzilla bug #33824&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, all of this could have been settled with a simple email.  Instead, this Beranger fellow starts spreading FUD, looks like he's seriously lacking in the investigation skills department, and generally makes a fool of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's the deal with the private bug report?  Well, it's 1) boring and 2) an internal tracker.  Yes, the security team uses bugzilla to track issues we need to deal with.  Are these safe for public consumption?  Sometimes.  Are they interesting to the public?  Not really.  I think the &lt;b&gt;result&lt;/b&gt; is more interesting.  For instance, I think that the actual advisory, MDKSA-2007:186, would be far more interesting than a bug report that's essentially a carbon-copy of the original CVE entry.  Now, in this case, perhaps bug #33824 could have had the alias CVE-2007-2834 as it was issued to resolve only one bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we do when an advisory deals with more than one CVE or issue?  We can't give one bug two different aliases.  So, let's look at bug #34610 (libvorbis).  If you look at the dependencies, you'll see bugs #33871 and #33872.  Both are private.  Both have aliases for the two CVE's fixed in that advisory.  Both use them as aliases.  Sure, I could remove the aliases from the CVE-entry-clone-reports, but I can't assign both to one bug.  Or what about the kernel?  Or firefox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is, internal tracking bugs have absolutely no relevance to anyone outside of the security team, so no, I don't see the point in making them public, even after they're dealt with.  It's nothing more than a glorified TODO list.  The advisory itself, and the associated bug report, are important... both of those are public.  We're not trying to hide any details... those details can be found in a dozen places: the public bugzilla advisory report, the official advisory on the website, the security-announce mailing list, the CVE dictionary, NVD, Secunia, Bugtrack (the website and the mailing list), the full-disclosure mailing list... the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fellow should have done a bit more research before starting in on his conspiracy theory.  It was both amusing and infuriating... amusing at his ignorance, infuriating that he would start the FUD train without even firing off a simple email saying "wtf guys, this bug is private?!?".  An easy explanation could have been given and the FUD train wouldn't have left the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's nice to see both Adam and Fabrice straighten this guy out in comments on his blog, and Fabrice made his own &lt;a href="http://www.linux-wizard.net/index.php?id_blog=161"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; regarding it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice said it quite well:  "So next time guys, get your facts ;)"&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, with Facebook you can set your status.. a little blurb like "I'm feeling this way" or "I'm tired" or whatever.  I find it really... wierd... that people have statuses like "I feel sick" or "I've been sick all night" and so on.  I mean, really... if you've got a bought of the runs or an upset stomach or something, the last thing I would be doing is hopping on the computer to update my Facebook status to indicate it.  It's like they rush to the toilet then rush back to Facebook to let the world know they've just rushed to the toilet.  It's very bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also interesting to see how much time people invest in Facebook.  For me, it's a communications medium.. I get in contact with some people that I've not talked to in a decade or more, which is pretty neat.  I've found one of my best friends from school on there that I've not talked to in about 8 years, an ex-girlfriend that cheated on me (Lord only knows why she wanted to be added to my friend list, but...).  My point is that for me, Facebook is a great way to talk to people that I've not talked to in a long time or wouldn't necessarily take the time to phone or email (provided I had their number or email address).  But with the number of discussion groups and little applications I see on people's profiles, I can tell they're spending a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of time on Facebook.  I find that odd that people want to spend time sending people "naughty gifts" or "virtual drinks", etc.  Call me wierd but that has absolutely no appeal to me at all.  Yet people have their pages absolutely littered with these useless little apps and keep sending me drinks/gifts/hamsters that, if I accepted, would add the same crap to my profile page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the paranoid security professional that I am, I don't want these third-party apps having blanket access to my personal info (not that I have more than the bare minimum in there anyways).  I wonder if all these people who put their phone numbers, email addresses, etc. realize that by authorizing these 3rd-party apps, they're essentially opening up one more hole to their personal info.  An unscrupulous app writer could easily obtain that info in some way, I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I find the whole social network "phenomenon" both worrying and fascinating.  I worry about the people who don't think about real issues like online privacy, and I'm fascinated with the amount of time they spend on this thing.  Me, I'd rather spend time interacting with real people (like my wife and daughter), playing games, or coding.  I guess that's just the geek in me.  Maybe Facebook needs more geek appeal.  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Novell ditches AppArmor... wtf?</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/novell-ditches-apparmor-wtf.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-12T00:29:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-10-12T00:29:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-10-12:/blog/novell-ditches-apparmor-wtf.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shocking news on the AppArmor mailing list today.

Novell laid off all the guys they hired when they aquired Immunix a few years ago, back in 2005.  I had noticed that my friend Seth had sent a message a while ago indicating that he has no longer with Novell and passing on a new email address and just chocked it up to him moving on.  But now I see this message from Crispin on the AppArmor development mailing list which pointed to &lt;a href="http://www.news.com/8301-13580_3-9796140-39.html"&gt;this CNET&lt;/a&gt; news piece describing what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like Novell wants the opensource community to pick up development of AppArmor (they must, they apparently let the entire team go).  Perhaps the success of OpenSUSE got to their heads and they're looking for cheap labour now?  At any rate, I find it rather ruthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I'm concerned about AppArmor...  I know SELinux is the star of the Fedora/Red Hat show, but AppArmor has a good showing in Mandriva 2008, forthcoming Ubuntu, and Annvix (amongst probably others).  Oh, and OpenSUSE/SLES itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also nice to see Crispin is still motivated to work on AppArmor and has built a consultancy company around it (and other security hardening technologies), &lt;a href="http://www.mercenarylinux.com/"&gt;Mercenary Linux&lt;/a&gt;.

While the other developers are busting their butts trying to get things finished for the upcoming release, I actually get to take a bit of a breather, largely because I don't like duplicating effort so any non-essential updates get to take a bit of a break until the next version comes out, so I can do an update once, instead of twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, once the release is out and the developers get to take a bit of a breather, my workload doubles (sometimes triples) because not only do I have to deal with those updates that had taken a break for a few days, but the inundation of bugfix requests really comes in.  It's no secret that the bulk of bugfix updates come out in the 2-3 weeks post-release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... welcome Mandriva 2008!  You're a very pretty beast (and now that you're out I get to play with you some more and see what you've got hiding up your sleeves (I don't have an opporunity or the time to fiddle with cooker too much)), and I'm sure I will be cursing you before the week is out.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cursing in a good way, of course (well, I hope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, congratulations to the development team on what looks to be a fantastic release (I've installed the RC's on two systems and despite some X quirks that I worked around (using my old xorg.conf), it looks pretty solid.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, they're married to Microsoft technology, and I doubt they even realize &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they are.  They're using an Active Directory-based authentication system and they keep having trouble with it...  new systems were donated to the school this year, and have are unable to login to the domain.... for no explainable reason.  File and print sharing works, but it's not seamless as it should be.  I poked around a bit on it, but know nothing about AD or how to manage it.  They're also using Microsoft Office, all the workstations are mix of anything from Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98, or something in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I've been reading a bit about about the increasing adoption of open source solutions in government and schools.  For instance, in Russia, &lt;a href="http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/indexEn.shtml?2007/09/14/266177"&gt;ALT Linux will be installed on every school system by 2009&lt;/a&gt;, replacing Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, the &lt;a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-Canadian-Labour-Congress-Switches-To-OpenOffice-65716.shtml"&gt;Canadian Labour Congress is switching from WordPerfect to OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt;, saving themselves about $60,000 in licensing fees (if they had switched to Microsoft Office).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also found that some of the technologies and methodologies used in the school are horribly ineffecient.  Things like using MSN for inter-office instant messaging.  Things like using Word documents to store little tidbits of info and placing them in shares for everyone to access.  Things that a good database with a groupware or wiki frontend would nicely handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'll setup (and donate) a server with a nice LAMP stack to provide some of this stuff... a jabber server for inter-office IM (no loss of service if their ISP goes down), a MediaWiki install, maybe phpGroupware or something similar.  Teachers have too little time as it is, and for it to be wasted doing inefficient and repetative tasks doesn't sit well with me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Obtaining file information with RPM</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/obtaining-file-information-with-rpm.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-09-18T08:38:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-09-18T08:38:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-09-18:/blog/obtaining-file-information-with-rpm.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today's tip over at TechRepublic is &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=101"&gt;Obtaining file information with RPM&lt;/a&gt;.

While it encompasses a lot of different things, the first thing I aim to try is to reclaim my email, which has been getting way out of hand lately.  I remember about 2 years ago I did the same thing and it lasted for a bit, but things never last unless you make them habit.  Of course, to make it habit now, I need to fix a few things first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing was to unsubscribe from non-essential mailing lists.  I used to sit on the openssh and exim mailing lists, amongst a few others, just to glean tips and insights and whatnot, with the full intention of implementing some of these ideas.  In fact, my exim mbox has over 150 &lt;em&gt;saved&lt;/em&gt; messages that go back about 3 years... messages I've thought "this would be good to try", etc.  But know what?  In three years, I've barely looked at those messages again, and I've implemented about 2% of the "content" of those saved messages into active implementations on my exim server.  And now that I've out-sourced most of the hosting I do for other people, those things don't apply since my exim server handles mail exclusively for me and some mailing lists I still run.  So do I need to know how to integrate spamassassin with clamav under exim?  Not really.  Do I need to learn more spam tricks?  Again, not really, since I use TMDA as my "guard" for my email accounts on that machine.  In other words, will I ever use those 150 exim messages?  Probably not.  Will I ever look at those mails again?  Even more unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been taking the axe to some old/saved messages and removing myself from mailing lists that I've had a cursory interest in but haven't really been active on.  It's slow going because you need to make a concious decision as to what is important and what isn't.  But the basic idea is to have these folders as empty as possible... even the mailing list ones.  It's not just enough to keep my inbox uncluttered, I want &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my mailboxes uncluttered.  And the less mail I have coming in that isn't important, the less time I spend deleting crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have my email under control again, I'm going to start looking at other areas to increase my productivity and reduce the amount of wasted time.  Time is a finite resource, and I have too little of it as it is... so I need to start making some changes to more effectively utilize my time.  Especially now that my daughter will be in school 5 days a week full-days (grade one, wOOp!) and my wife will be working full-time (as the secretary of the school my daughter goes to), if I discipline myself to get up when they do (and, of course, not go to bed at 1am), then I have a good 8hr window in which to work.  My main goal is to stuff the 10+hrs of work I do every day for Mandriva into those 8 hours.  There should be no external distractions (at least not of the same magnitude anyways), which already gives me a bit of an edge, but if I can squeeze it even more by getting rid of the inconsequential &lt;em&gt;crap&lt;/em&gt; that seems to suck up so much time, then I think I can probably take those 10+hrs and compress them maybe into 6-7hrs and actually give myself some breathing room and get &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea here is the concept that if my wife and kid are gone all day, when they come home I'd like to spend time with them... time with them instead of finishing up this update or that, writing articles for TechRepublic, or doing other work-related things.  A worthy goal, I think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="gtd"></category><category term="email"></category></entry><entry><title>Configure wireless support in Mandriva with ndiswrapper</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/configure-wireless-support-in-mandriva-with-ndiswrapper.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-08-28T09:09:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-08-28T09:09:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-08-28:/blog/configure-wireless-support-in-mandriva-with-ndiswrapper.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New article on TechRepublic from yours truly about &lt;a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com/opensource/?p=91"&gt;Configuring wireless support in Mandriva with ndiswrapper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="techmail"></category><category term="mandriva"></category></entry><entry><title>Macintosh's Witnesses</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/macintoshs-witnesses.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-08-21T21:21:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-08-21T21:21:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-08-21:/blog/macintoshs-witnesses.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This comic from &lt;a href="http://www.joyoftech.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/998b.html"&gt;The Joy of Tech&lt;/a&gt; is awesome.

It's a little tongue-in-cheek because "Free" here isn't free in the sense that we in the open source world view things... neither free as in beer nor free as in speech.  Free as in pirated, rather.  And as I was reading it, I realized this fellow has nailed it on the head &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; right.  Not only had I never thought of it that way before, but as I read it I realized that no only does he have it right, I don't think anyone could have articulated society's attitude on Windows vs Linux (even the Mac) better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to think that the possibility is quite distinct that one reason Linux adoption hasn't taken off is because when you tell people it's completely free, they just nod and say "that's nice" instead of thinking they can save hundreds of dollars... no cost for Windows, no cost for Office (using OpenOffice.org instead), even no cost for Photoshop using something like the GIMP instead.  No... they don't think that way because to them Windows, Office, and Photoshop are often just as free... easily downloaded pirated copies, cracks, or buddies with copies and valid licenses they just pass over.  So the bottom line is Windows doesn't cost them money, so they don't get excited about another OS that doesn't cost them money.  After all, chances are they're not paying for it now and if they need to upgrade, well... there's always bittorrent and friends with a copy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd encourage anyone with a few minutes to read the article.  It's lengthy, but wow is it an eye opener.&lt;/p&gt;

However, last week I bought Guitar Hero II with the guitar controller when we got back from our little trip (my nephew had it out at my in-law's and my wife was actually playing it (I looked around to see if hell had frozen over)).  I had given it a try out there, but stunk pretty bad... an amusing game however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... brought it home and really got into it.  Had to move the PS2 out of my office or I'd get no work done with my wife wanting to play it during work hours.  At any rate, I've been spending quite a bit of time on it in the evenings over the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll freely admit that I'm addicted to Guitar Hero like a crack whore is addicted to crack.  I don't think I was ever this stoked over World of Warcraft or EverQuest (back in the day), or really any other game I've yet played.  I think part of it is that it doesn't feel like a game as much as others do... no keyboard, no game controller, just a plastic guitar with buttons and some pretty furious finger work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm getting better... not the greatest yet (but hey, I've only had it for a week now)... I'm managing to pull off five stars on most songs on Easy mode (I've beat all 3 Guitar Hero games on Easy so far, working my way through Medium on Guitar Hero II now).  I've gotten a couple four star ratings on Medium, but I'm mostly hitting three stars.  Although I'm definitely getting better.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not quite like playing a real guitar but close enough that my brother, who can play guitar and bass, picked it up quite quickly last night.  Give him a week with the game and he'd likely be embarrassing the pants off me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that... what could be better than a game that has classic tunes like "Balls to the Wall", "Shout at the Devil", and "Holy Wars" as part of it's line up?  Ok, there's some pretty bad songs on there too, but it's pretty gratifying to be able to say that I can play along with Megadeth... =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Bugzilla is DONE dangit!!</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/bugzilla-is-done-dangit.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-07-17T15:10:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-07-17T15:10:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-07-17:/blog/bugzilla-is-done-dangit.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a few really long weeks, bugzilla is finally live.

&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Par for the course I guess.  However, I'm seriously considering taking the next two days off to recover some of my personal time that was spent doing this thing over the last 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's fast, it's clean... the old one had a fairly nasty sanitycheck output... in fact, it was so long it died before it completed, oddly enough.  At any rate, there are now a total of 3 errors, and 2 of those are "invalid email address" formats for the login name of 2 accounts.  In other words, bugzilla has nothing to complain about.  Of course, it took some very heavy (manual) SQL manipulation to correct most of those errors.  But it's done now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is a new maintainers database; right now it's using the old one which is pretty... well.. fugly.  A new one will need to be done, but that involves writing it completely from scratch, with backend scripts and whatnot as well.  Anne hasn't asked me to do it (yet), so we'll leave things well enough alone until she does or someone else gets assigned to it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="bugzilla"></category></entry><entry><title>Bugzilla and maintainer groups</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/bugzilla-and-maintainer-groups.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-30T21:19:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-06-30T21:19:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-06-30:/blog/bugzilla-and-maintainer-groups.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The bugzilla conversion is almost complete, except for a few minor issues that need to be figured out (such as who will be owning the bugs initiall when they are submitted).

&lt;p&gt;Now the only thing left to do is handle components in a sane fashion (and fix a bugzilla bug that doesn't respect group memberships for QA contact).  The below is a posting to cooker regarding how I think ownership and maintainership of packages should be handled.  Not everyone will agree with me, but I think it would work out pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion on package maintainership, is that it does not make
much
sense for us, except possibly for very important packages. For Debian,
package maintainership makes sense, because most packagers actually
package
what they regularly use, and because they have an acceptable
source-packages/maintainers ratio. It is usual for Debian maintainers to
step down from maintenance when they stop being users of a package. In
Mandriva, we have many packages which are just packaged for users, not the
packager, convenience, and so the packager may not really know or care a
lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  The problem here is that people package stuff they don't use.
Which is ok, to the extent that we package a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of stuff, and some
things one fellow might use more than another, or it's just being
packaged for the sake of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintainer groups would solve this (to some extent).  For instance,
since I mostly care about security/server stuff, it would be logical for
me to be part of the Networking and Security groups.  Do I want to
actually &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt; anything?  No.  I don't have enough time to be the
maintainer for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, having said that, would I like to see the bugs posted to those
components?  Yes.  Do I want to see the bugs for KDE?  No, I don't use
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have two issues here... I can't possibly filter bugs based on what
I use/like in the current scenario.  My procmail filter would be crazy
trying to filter out everything except bugs on php, apache, openssh,
xchat, whatever.  So I either get everything, or I get nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; potentially fix (or have already fixed) an issue in,
say, openssh, I'd like to at least see bugs that get assigned to it.  Or
perhaps I'm more knowledgeable than the average person.  In this way, I
can be a part of the Networking maintainer group, see those bugs, and
can jump in and fix/re-assign to me the bugs that I know I can fix
quickly (or invalidate them if they're bogus).  This doesn't mean I all
of a sudden &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt; openssh, but that I'm aware of what is happening
to it, by proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could actually further be extended to the point of not having one
big bug mailing list.  We could do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) cooker ml
2) maintainer groups ml (kde_team@, gnome_team@, security_team@, etc.)
and people who want to be a part of those groups either subscribe to
those lists or otherwise get added (Andreas had thought about using LDAP
to create impromptu mailing lists for teams, so that's a possibility
too)
2a) bugs reported to the Networking group have a QA contact of
network_team@ instead of cooker@ or bugs@; this makes the &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt; the QA
contact instead of a) one big ml or b) an individual who 1) may not
care, 2) be too busy, 3) no longer is involved, or 4) is on holidays;
essentially bugs get &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; coverage this way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drawback here is that these groups/teams would need to be defined
and setup.  The logical start to the creation of these teams would be to
have them correspond with components (KDE, GNOME, X.org, Printing,
etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone is unsure about how/what to do something in a package, he may
well have better luck just looking up and asking the top entries in
changelog, or asking cooker@, than asking a maintainer who just packaged
something and forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly.  Or, with maintainer groups/teams, asking the members of the
team (i.e. the networking_team@ alias/ml could be consulted rather than
a maintainer or cooker in general).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people will argue that maybe this will make cooker@ less useful,
but I disagree.  Discussion can certainly take place on cooker@, and
should.  But maintainer teams can facilitate the entire packaging
process by making more people able to fix/change/update packages even
though they aren't "the maintainer".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, aren't we all in favour of (and haven't we been doing, in
fact) the removal of per-user ACLs for most packages in the buildsystem?
For what reason do we do this?  To allow more people to work on packages
(except for some "core" packages, of course).  Moving to a team-based
model facilitates this even further, and doesn't &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; the usefulness
of current cooker@; there are many people on the list who aren't
maintainers and thus discussion should still be done here.  But an
internal ml/alias for a team facilitates discussion of things pertaining
to the team ((re-)assignment of packages, figuring who will claim a bug,
etc.) that the average cooker probably doesn't care about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="bugzilla"></category></entry><entry><title>New bugzilla in the works</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/new-bugzilla-in-the-works.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-28T22:21:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-06-28T22:21:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-06-28:/blog/new-bugzilla-in-the-works.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, someone else was supposed to be working on the new bugzilla, but they got pulled off for an OEM project (completely understandable), so since I really need some functionality and speed out of bugzilla to progress with some work flows I have in mind, I decided to hunker down …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, someone else was supposed to be working on the new bugzilla, but they got pulled off for an OEM project (completely understandable), so since I really need some functionality and speed out of bugzilla to progress with some work flows I have in mind, I decided to hunker down and do the dang thing myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters you can take a peek at the current implementation here: &lt;a href="http://bugzilla.linsec.ca/"&gt;bugzilla.linsec.ca&lt;/a&gt;.  A good sample bug to really take a peek at might be bug #26975.  Or, well heck, any bug you like really.  Existing logins for the current Mandriva bugzilla do work on this new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to dig around in the database schema and data and convert a dataset I had obtained about a month ago.  The script to convert it is a fairly nice (but hackish) piece of work, which was difficult due to the idea of moving from package-based components to "group"-based components; instead of filing a bug against x11-server-some-video-driver you would file it against X.org.  With an optional "RPM Package" field to include the exact rpm package if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script works well and interacts with two databases (old and new) to retrieve values from each and writes it out to a plain-text SQL file.  It takes about 30s for it to convert 30600+ bugs, which isn't bad since it's doing a tonne of regexp magic to figure out what package (libfoo) goes to what new Component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products and Versions are also handled different (better)... the version is now the distro version, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the package version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it's &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.  Of course, that's what happens when you trim the database fat.  The old bugzilla database is about 5.2GB of data.  The new one is about 500MB.  Makes a huge difference in speed, plus looking up bugs, submitting bugs (yaa!  a single page to enter a new bug!) and so on is much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this needed to be done a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and sorry to the folks at Red Hat... I used their layout/style and tried to emulate it (their bugzilla looks very clean) and I think I did a fairly decent job of it.  It looks quite a bit different from our current bugzilla, but I think it turned out pretty good (a few things aside).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still a few things need to be done.  Hopefully next week we can actually implement this thing live.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="mandriva"></category><category term="bugzilla"></category></entry><entry><title>PhoneValet, AppleScript, Growl, and remote voicemail notifications</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/phonevalet-applescript-growl-and-remote-voicemail-notifications.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-18T22:01:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-06-18T22:01:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-06-18:/blog/phonevalet-applescript-growl-and-remote-voicemail-notifications.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been using PhoneValet to handle the voicemail system here.

It's an OS X app and it works really good.  I've run it on my desktop, but now that I have a spare OS X machine that I've turned into a bit of a server, I've put PhoneValet on there.  With PhoneValet Anywhere, I still get notifications on my desktop as to who is calling so that I don't have to lean over and look at the phone, which was one of the original reasons for purchasing it.  However, with PhoneValet on the server, in another room, I have no way of telling if there's a voicemail message unless I check my email which can be sporadic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no functionality in PhoneValet to allow for it to tell a remote *Anywhere client that a voicemail arrived, but it does have support to run AppleScripts after a voicemail has been left.  So after an hour or so of fiddling around, I came up with a nice solution.  It's not the cleanest solution, but it works.  It involves using AppleScript, a shell script, and the growlnotify commandline client.  It's a little convoluted, but works quite well enough.  I did initially think to use ssh and ssh keys, but missed that growlnotify has support for listening to remote systems so opted to use that instead (although for receiving growl notifications from Linux boxes, using ssh/ssh keys would work very well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in the same situation and up for the challenge, read on.
On the system that you want to receive the notifcations, install Growl.  Go into System Preferences -&amp;gt; Growl and hit the Network tab.  Check off the "Listen for incoming notifications" and set a Server password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the system that PhoneValet is running on, make sure Growl, and the growlnotify commandline program (in the Extras folder) are installed and create a shellscript.  I called this ~/bin/gnotify_voicemail with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
msg="$*"
/usr/local/bin/growlnotify -n gnotify -I /Applications/iSync.app -H remote.host.com \
-P secret -s -m "$*"  Voicemail has arrived!
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This needs to be edited to suit your system.  The remote host (-H; remote.host.com in this case) is the host to connect to and you need to supply the password you used previously (in this case "secret").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all you need to do is create the AppleScript.  PhoneValet looks for the voicemail-related AppleScripts in /Library/Application Support/Parliant/AppleScripts/VoiceMail/ so I created "Growl Voicemail.scpt" there with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
--This script calls the gnotify shellscript which in turn calls growlnotify on the remote system(s) in order to indicate that a voicemail has arrived

on process_voicemail_message(callerName, callerNumber, soundFilePath, callTime, lineName, domesticAreaCode, domesticNumber, mailboxName)

    set call_date to date callTime
    -- format the caller name
    if (callerName = "") then
        set cname to "Unknown"
    else
        set cname to callerName
    end if

    do shell script "/Users/vdanen/bin/gnotify_voicemail Voicemail from " &amp; cname &amp; " at " &amp; callTime

end process_voicemail_message
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, change the location of the shellscript to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, fire up PhoneValet, go into Preferences -&amp;gt; AppleScripts, hit the "Voice Mail" tab and check off the "Growl Voicemail.scpt" script, save and exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also test the shellscript real quick by executing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ~/bin/gnotify_voicemail "This is a test message"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure the script is executable, of course.  When you execute that, you should see a growl popup on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now whenever you receive a voicemail you should get a popup on your workstation (or the computer that PhoneValet is not running on).  You might want to modify the Growl preferences for this so that the popups are sticky, so to do that go into the Growl preference pane, go into the Applications tab, scroll down and look for "gnotify" and make sure it's enabled.  Change the Display to "Brushed" or something similar and make sure Sticky is enabled.  Now even if the voice mail was left a minute ago or 10 hours ago, the growl notification will remain on your screen for you to see when you get back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this also assumes your workstation is on 24/7 to receive the Growl notifications.  If it's not on, I'm pretty sure you won't get the notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, quick and hurried write-up (it's late and I want to go to bed), but hopefully that'll give you enough to get going.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>The perfect desktop: Mandriva 2007.1</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/the-perfect-desktop-mandriva-20071.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-02T15:03:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-06-02T15:03:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-06-02:/blog/the-perfect-desktop-mandriva-20071.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Came across this good HOWTO on HowtoForge entitled &lt;a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/the_perfect_desktop_mandriva_2007_spring_free"&gt;The Perfect Desktop: Mandriva 2007 Spring Free (Mandriva 2007.1)&lt;/a&gt;.

There's some tutorials out there, but they're all pretty terse... most of the stuff it's almost assumed that you already know.  Anyways, used the church I go to since I have access to one of the servers there and set it up as an OpenVPN server with the appropriate forwarding via the firewall (a linksys "box").  Then set my firewall for my LAN as the OpenVPN client.  Connection established, works great.  Can ping the server from the client; however despite following some tutorials with shorewall/OpenVPN integration, I could only get the firewall itself to ping the remote server.  None of the clients systems would (which makes it a little silly since the idea is to have always-on access from any machine on my network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, installed this software called &lt;a href="http://tunnelblick.net/"&gt;Tunnelblick&lt;/a&gt; for OS X to stick on my laptop and see if I could get one client to talk.  Works well enough, but Tunnelblick comes with absolutely no documentation.  It's a free GUI to OpenVPN so I suppose I shouldn't complain too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I could mount a samba share on my laptop from the server in the church.  Mission accomplished, for the most part (although trying to get any of these guys at the church to setup Tunnelblick would probably result in my getting kicked out of the church).  One thing I had wanted to do was to access the firewall's web interface, but was unable to... for some reason I can ping the server, but not the firewall.  Maybe the VPN connection makes the connection between the two machines only, instead of allowing me to access any resource from here (useful for samba, I guess, but at that point I'd rather just use SFTP and drop OpenVPN altogether since the idea is to allow remote access of files for the staff).  However, I did follow a tutorial on making one LAN access another LAN... not sure why it's not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, then I whipped out my absolute favourite tool to solve the job... a quick ssh tunnel and I was able to access the remote firewall's web interface from the inside.  Gotta love ssh port forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully tomorrow I can get the whole LAN&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;LAN thing working.  Need to find some different (better?) tutorials I guess.

&lt;p&gt;My first impressions are this:  the boot was extremely quiet.  That's ok, but I wasn't sure what was happening at first.  Then I get in, start poking around a bit, and decide to run their update utility.  Says I have to run "apt-get install -f".  That's a clear sign something is borked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, apt wants to remove all of GNOME.  So I let it (it's a vmware image, after all... no harm there).  Ok, so now my install is ok, but I'm in GNOME in a gnome-terminal, and apparently all these programs are gone and I'd kinda like to have them back.  Do you think apt tells me where the problem is?  Nope.  It keeps telling me about unmet dependencies until my "apt-get install gnome-core ..." line is getting ridiculously long as I keep adding new packages.  And then &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; it tells me what's wrong.  Apparently "libsoup2.2-8" is not available.  It could have told me that right at the beginning.  And people think RPM has dependency hell?  Ummm... ok... this is apt, using (from what I can tell) deb packages, and clearly it has issues too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the appeal of Nexenta is...  hmmm... I'm not really sure.  It's running GNOME.  It's brown.  Looks an awful lot like Ubuntu.  It's not using all GNU tools.  Heck, it's not even using BSD tools.  I mean, really, "ps ax" works on my mac and on my linux boxen.  Does it work here?  Nope.  Gives me usage.  The man page lies too.  Oh, it talks all nice and sweet about using -a and -x, but there is no -x, and -a doesn't give me all my processes, it gives me one process (and probably the most useless at that)... ps itself.  How cool is that?  So if you want to know how long it took to run your ps command, and what it's pid was, use "ps -a".  The closest thing to "ps ax" that I can see is "ps -e".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses GRUB.  That's kinda neat.  No idea where the kernel is hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these aren't really comments against Nexenta, OpenSolaris, or Solaris/SunOS themselves... it's largely my own ignorance, but why are they calling themselves "GNU/OpenSolaris" and not using better GNU tools?  I mean, OS X uses the BSD ps and it's more feature-rich than the SunOS ps.  Nevermind the Linux ps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Again, I'm just ignorant of anything other than *BSD or Linux.  It was interesting, and maybe I'll try again once someone has a libsoup2.2-8 package for apt to install (not too keen on just plain old not having GNOME around anymore because then it would make for some fairly boring playing around).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Bugzilla and email</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/bugzilla-and-email.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-24T23:31:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-05-24T23:31:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-05-24:/blog/bugzilla-and-email.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had asked on IRC the other day for info on how to send emails to bugzilla.

I had all my websites setup on my machine with IP-based virtual hosts (i.e. &lt;VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80&gt;) and was trying to use wildcards (*:80) and it just wasn't working right the way I wanted it to, because I wanted some sites restricted to a certain IP, and others that would respond to the dynamic IP of my cable provider.  Just for kicks I tried something with shorewall that actually worked quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In shorewall, you can write a rule like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNAT    net             loc:10.0.5.10   tcp     http    -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which takes an incoming http connection to the firewall and forwards it to the appropriate IP (10.0.5.10 in this case) in the "loc" (local) zone.  So I tried the same thing except the IP wasn't an external machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, eth0 is connected to the internet and gets a dynamic IP via DHCP.  eth1 is connected to my internal network, similar to the firewall.  It also runs shorewall.  So I made eth1:0 an IP on the local network (say, 10.0.5.100).  Then I have a rule that does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNAT    net     net:10.0.5.100  tcp     http    -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This takes the http traffic coming in from the network on port 80 and redirects it to port 10.0.5.100 (or incoming port 80 on eth0 to eth1:0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works like a champ!  This way I can configure apache to use &lt;VirtualHost 10.0.5.100:80&gt;, and never need to change anything if the external IP changes because it only listens on that IP, and shorewall will take care of the forwarding (and it doesn't care what the IP on eth0 is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure someone has come up with this before, but I was goofing around and came up with this and it worked so figured I'd share as this is much easier to manage than using wildcard addressing, particularly if you want to use https in there as well (anyone who was connecting earlier tonight probably got an XML download instead of a web page, and for that you have my apologies).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Week of hell... domain relocation and moving</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/week-of-hell-domain-relocation-and-moving.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-18T21:25:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-05-18T21:25:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-05-18:/blog/week-of-hell-domain-relocation-and-moving.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the consulting business that I run, I do some web hosting on the side, usually for clients I take from start to finish; those I design/develop the site for and then end up hosting it for them.

I used to do this with a box at a colocation facility close to me and it was reasonably priced, for a modest amount of bandwidth I could use.  Of course, the major advantages were that a) it had a faster pipe than my cable at home (well, DSL when I was running the hosting out of the house), and b) I had root access (and developed the OS) so could tweak things to my heart's content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week I moved all of my clients' sites and a few of my smaller ones to one of those large big-bandwidth-low-cost webhosting outfits.  After all, the majority of "normal" people are going this route and this company has about 10k sites their hosting and the price is pretty good ($25/mo for 400GB data transfer).  The problem is a small amount of space (40GB) and lack of root access.  =)  I've got a reseller account with them, so it's introduced me to things like WHM and cPanel, both of which are pretty decent tools, if you need the point-n-click hand-holding.  Of course, doing shared hosting like this (getting a dedicated server there would cost over $300USD/mo, although I'd get full access to the box and 2TB of bandwidth).  I don't have enough clients to pay $300USD/mo, however (although that is a pretty good deal for the bandwidth; compared to where I was colocating my box, I'd be paying 2-3x that here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the long and short is it was a nightmare.  All of a sudden losing the ability to fix things on your own that you know damn well how to fix and waiting for technical support to do it for you is frustrating beyond words.  For instance, I setup a small mailman mailing list.  I could send mail to it, but it wasn't sending mail out.  Now, if I had root access to the box I could have fixed it in 5 minutes.  Nevermind they're running CentOS which I've never looked at.  I'm familiar with mailman, and I'm familiar with exim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took 2 days for them to fix it with multiple "it's working now" and multiple "like hell it is" interactions.Beyond the problems with mailman, I have no ability to use suhosin (which they've been trying to get enabled for a few days now... works with PHP4 but they can't seem to make it work with PHP5), I don't have access to the MySQL5 databsae server (despite repeated "it should work now"), I had them assign me to a shared IP on the system when I should have had my own dedicated IP (which was a severe PITA to correct since they insisted I needed to move all 27 domains &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; I had configured them.. and then they did it when I was asleep and not when I asked them to), they had spamassassin misconfigured so it didn't put headers in emails, one of my domains had an external MX entry and it was being routed to the local account associated with that domain instead of to the external MX like it should have been)...  the long and short is I was freaking out multiple times this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that most of the clients I have are friends or people I have a good working relationship with (or both).  I'm not so concerned about losing money, but I am concerned about pissing off people that I'm usually on very good terms with and have had exceptional service from me for years.  But, I think, for the most part (other than mysql5 and suhosin, neither of which are absolutely necessary any longer), it's done.  All my clients are there, and my "minor" domains are there too.  For the simple stuff, it works fine (now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I tried to put mediawiki on there last night for the linsec site and had a helluvatime trying to make it work.  In order for me to have it setup the way I want it (with url rewriting, etc.). I need access to httpd.conf.  The problem is, I could probably get them to accomodate those configuration issues for me, but I don't want to wait 2 days to get it, and I don't want to have to tell them 5 times in 5 different ways on how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, linsec.ca and annvix.org are back home with me.  I've got a dyndns account, so things like the MX records for the domains are pointing here and looks to be working just peachy.  The domains are a bit of an issue because cPanel (whether this is bind legalese or not, I don't know) won't let me set "linsec.ca" to a CNAME, it insists it has to be an A record (which I find wierd, but ok).  So I can have the MX pointing directly here, so I should never lose mail, and I'll have to change the IP in cPanel (since they can do the DNS instead of me doing it myself here) if it changes with my ISP which seldom happens, but does on occassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I'm sure I was far more demanding than most of their clients.  I think I had 12 support tickets in the last week.  I admit that I'm a PITA and I guess having an experienced sysadmin as a customer must suck on their end because all of a sudden they need to be held up to a higher standard (i.e. my standard) than they would with just a regular joe who made their website in frontpage or dreamweaver and just needs a place to stick it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value for the money... well, I think it's good enough.  I can't expect everything for that price, and I don't.  I do expect competence, however, and I don't think that's too much to ask.  I'd also like faster support turnaround on issues that should be pretty straightforward.  I mean, really, if you tell me that mysql5 is setup and the accounts I requested are created, I'd expect you to test that before telling me it's working.  This obviously wasn't done because I can't login via the CLI or via phpmyadmin.  A quick 10s test would have &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; indicated that replying to my support ticket with an "it's good" was vastly premature.  That kinda stuff pisses me off.  If you're gonna fix something, &lt;em&gt;verify&lt;/em&gt; it's fixed before you tell the customer it's fixed.  That just plain old makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I won't say who the company is because I don't want to give them a bad name (yet) unless they don't smarten up.  They've been appropriately apologetic, and I've spoken with upper management who indicated they were short staffed last weekend and presumably part of the week, so to be fair I'll give them some time to get stuff fixed.  But seriously, if they haven't managed to get mysql and suhosin working by next monday I'm really going to have to question the amount of time they're giving the ticket, whether they truly want to make the customer happy, or whether they've got a factor of dolts maintaining these machines because neither issue should take more than a few hours at the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; to get working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes venting feels good (although, had I wrote about this earlier this week it probably would have read like something from an N.W.A. song or something).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>VMware Workstation 6 and Sound in Mandriva</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/vmware-workstation-6-and-sound-in-mandriva.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-10T14:52:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-05-10T14:52:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-05-10:/blog/vmware-workstation-6-and-sound-in-mandriva.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I keep running into this issue everytime I have to run vmware tools so I thought I'd mention it here.  vmware-tools insists on rewriting /etc/modprobe.conf and changing "alias sound-slot-0 snd-ens1371" to "alias sound es1371".&lt;/p&gt;

I've finished rqp, the counter-part to rqs.  rqp imports the requires, provides, and file lists of binary rpm packages into a postgresql (or mysql, or sqlite (although I've only tested with postgresql so far)) database and queries the same data.  rqp resembles urpmf/urpmq in functionality although it's not quite as feature-rich.  But if all you do is query for which packages contain what file, or what package provides or what package requires that, rqp works great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting tidbits:  it took rqp 22 minutes to import the rpms of 2007.1/x86_64, which is 5490 packages or 5.6GB of packages.  The database contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Tag Records : 11              Package Records : 32828          
File Records: 4245034         Requires Records: 434693         
                              Provides Records: 154859
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially it has the data for the currently supported 11 distributions (MNF2, CD3, CD3/x86_64, CS3, CS3/x86_64, CS4, CS4/x86_64, 2007, 2007/x86_64, 2007.1, and 2007.1/x86_64).  That's a lot of data.  In contrast, the database for rqs contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Tag Records : 4               Package Records: 7791           
File Records: 4226875         Source Records : 40233 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely because rqp needs to distinguish between architecture and Corp3 (which is 4 "binary products" comes from one pool of source rpms).  Anyways, I benchmarked rqp versus urpmf, and this is where it gets really interesting.  urpmf was run on a 2007.1/x86 system (and keep in mind, urpmf &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; knows about 2007.1/x86).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[qateam@mercury ~]$ time urpmf whois | wc -l
5.04user 0.33system 0:03.99elapsed 134%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+17476minor)pagefaults 0swaps
34
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So urpmf found 34 matches in 3.99s.  The same with rqp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
vdanen@artemis:~/ &gt;% time ./rqp -q whois -C
rqp $Id: rqp 183 2007-05-05 18:35:24Z vdanen $

187 matche(s) in database for substring (whois)
./rqp -q whois -C  0.04s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 9.796 total
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoah!  rqp found 187 matches across 11 distributions in pretty much the exact same time.  urpmf is written in perl access a single file (although, to be fair, I believe urpmf has to uncompress the hdlist.cz first before reading it).  rqp is written in php and access a postgresql database over TCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, I'm impressed with rqp's speed; I thought urpmf would beat it hands down.  I haven't done any urpmq runs to look up provides/requires although I imagine the time difference between the two would be about the same.  Of course, urpmf/urpmq are more handy because you don't need to import anything or setup a database, etc.  rqp is vastly superior for what I need though, as this way I no longer have to jump into a chroot (or various chroots) to run urpmf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, rqp (and rqs) have to do things like establish database connections, read and parse a small configuration file, and other things that urpmf never needs to do.  Still need s some more work clean things up, but so far I'm pleased with the basic functionality.  2+ days well-spent in coding this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, if there was a vulnerability in foo.c, we could do "srpm -q foo.c" to see if that source file exists anywhere; this helped us find a bunch of PDF-related programs that were vulnerable to issues in xpdf.  An invaluable tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with it was it was using sqlite, which is fine, but I've been thinking about a web frontend to it and wanted to make it more general (and due to PHP's sqlite module, I'd need both it and sqlite2 installed on Annvix).  So I took the liberty of rewriting parts of it and also making it use the PEAR MDB2 functionality to make it portable.  Right now I've got it working with a PostgreSQL database, which is kinda nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about the database abstraction stuff is that it doesn't seem to be slowing things down too much.  With srpm (which uses straight php sqlite functions), I get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ time srpm -q libgen.h -C
39 matche(s) in database for substring (libgen.h)
3.31user 0.60system 0:04.15elapsed 94%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same query with rqs results in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
% time ./rqs -q libgen.h -C 
rqs $Id: rqs 175 2007-05-04 03:30:24Z vdanen $
39 matche(s) in database for substring (libgen.h)
./rqs -q libgen.h -C  0.05s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 15.651 total
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So about a 1s increase using database abstraction and postgresql vs using straight php sqlite functions and an sqlite database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two databases are the same, in that they have data for CS3, CS4, 2007, and 2007.1.  According to rqs, this provides the following records:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 $Id: rqs 173 2007-05-03 18:58:34Z vdanen $

Database statistics:

Tag Records : 4               Package Records: 7791           
File Records: 4226875         Source Records : 40233 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really interesting thing is importing.  Stew told me that srpm took quite a bit to import data, but I didn't realize how slow it was (I've never used srpm to import anything before).  To normalize the database I had to import the 2007.1 sources (and remove the 2006 sources from it).  The resulting import of 4.5GB of src.rpm files via srpm was 4:33:52 (yes, 4.5hrs).  With rqs, the import of the same src.rpm directory took 52:05, so just under an hour.  Scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now the next step is to write rqs' counterpart (rqp) which will do the same thing rqs does for src.rpms with binary rpms.  And then the web frontend to it as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>New mutt 1.5.15 has a very nice new feature!</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/new-mutt-1515-has-a-very-nice-new-feature.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-04-30T10:18:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-04-30T10:18:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-04-30:/blog/new-mutt-1515-has-a-very-nice-new-feature.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just found today when I was looking to see if I missed something with the mutt sidebar patch (still irritates me that I have to sync a mailbox &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; jumping to another mailbox in order for the counts in the sidebar to be updated properly), that mutt 1.5.15 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just found today when I was looking to see if I missed something with the mutt sidebar patch (still irritates me that I have to sync a mailbox &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; jumping to another mailbox in order for the counts in the sidebar to be updated properly), that mutt 1.5.15 was released earlier this month.  This is an extremely worthwhile upgrade, especially because it now has SMTP support built-in.  It's about time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more having to use exim or postfix to relay the mail, you can now send the mail out directly from mutt itself which makes things a whole lot nicer.  The &lt;a href="http://www.mutt.org/doc/devel/manual.html#smtp-url"&gt;relevant section of the documentation&lt;/a&gt; covers it a little bit more, but I've just tested it out and it works great (you will want to compile it using --enable-smtp and --with-sasl).  Works wonderfully with non-authenticated SMTP (good for using your ISP's mail server) and also works with authenticated SMTP (tried with my server which uses CRAM-MD5), and also supports using an email address as a login (i.e you could use "set smtp_url="smtp://joe@user.com:password@smtp.myhost.com" and it works properly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, kudos to the mutt team for getting this in place!  I'll have to update my wiki to cover this as it largely makes irrelevant the sections I have in there configuring postfix and exim to relay mail (which you can still do if you like).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva 2007.1 on HP TX1120 tablet</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/mandriva-20071-on-hp-tx1120-tablet.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-04-26T17:20:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-04-26T17:20:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-04-26:/blog/mandriva-20071-on-hp-tx1120-tablet.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I had the opportunity to install 2007.1 on a HP TX1120 laptop (a tablet).

Came pre-installed with Vista Home Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: Vista is awful!  Ick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second: Mandriva 2007.1 installs and runs really nice on this, with a few caveats.  I used the 32bit version (tried the 64bit one as well, it seems to work no worse than the 32bit although the throughput from the wireless card seems lower), and the wireless card works with ndiswrapper.  Sound doesn't work (yet, I've done some reading and it seems like this card isn't really liked).  The bcm43xx driver does not work (no choice but to use ndiswrapper).  The graphics display was properly detected and configured.  Putting the thing to sleep (hibernation, suspend?  no idea what to call it, I pushed a button by accident and it went to sleep and wouldn't properly resume).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The touchscreen doesn't seem to work at all.  Not sure if I'm missing something, but MCC doesn't seem to offer anything to configure it, there's nothing special noted in the xorg.conf file, and the reading I've done that pointed to a callibration tool and a driver have done nothing for me yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it's a really nice laptop.  Might have to get myself one of these; my Toshiba Libretto is being under-used because my fingers are too fat to work on the keyboard properly.  But this guy is pretty small (smaller than my macbook), although the glossy back makes fingerprints really stick out and the screen itself is really amusing to look at after my daughter does some writing on it (in Vista, unfortunately).  Haven't tried the SD card reader yet to see if that works, but as it stands now, it's very very usable (although sound and the tablet itself working would be a really nice bonus.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>No more wow in WoW</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/no-more-wow-in-wow.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-04-26T17:11:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-04-26T17:11:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-04-26:/blog/no-more-wow-in-wow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've played WoW for about 2 years now... it doesn't do much for me anymore.

Kinda frustrating, feels like it's more of a chore than a joy to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried this new one from SOE the other day: Vanguard Saga of Heroes.  Very nice graphics... almost too nice.  Can't play the damn thing without it being all choppy and stuff, even when I meet the recommended requirements.  Aaaargh!  Looks like EverQuest on steroids (the original EverQuest, mind you, not EQ2).  Oh well.  I don't think much will be happening with that one beyond the initial 30 days.  Pretty disappointed; it had some concepts that I thought would make a nice change from WoW, but it's barely playable (well, it is playable, but not nearly as fluid/smooth as WoW is and come on, I don't have crappy hardware either so it's pretty irritating).&lt;/p&gt;

It was an extremely interesting read.  So interesting, in fact, that I had to share it just because it astounds me what Microsoft is (or isn't, as the case may be) thinking.  Disclaimer:  I have spent all of 5 minutes in any kind of close proximity to a Vista install, and that was at Staples when I went in for some more blank DVD-R's.  All I can say is it looks pretty, but from a useability standpoint, I have no idea as I pretty much just opened the start menu (honestly, I was more interested in the laptop hardware Vista was running on than Vista itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fellow, Andrew Grygus, makes some interesting points.  I've heard many of the horror stories of Vista, and I've also heard a lot of the PR crap coming out of Redmond, but it becomes more interesting when governments and schools are putting full-out bans on Vista installs and/or are upgrading entire networks to Linux systems instead of taking the plunge to upgrade to Vista.  I also find it interesting that a lot of consumers are sticking with XP and their older hardware, than having to pay for the upgrade to Vista, buy a whole new system and, in many cases, having to buy new hardware that's been certified for Vista because no Vista drivers for their old peripherals are forthcoming, and probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I find it more than interesting.  I find it astounding.  I also find it amazing that with all this negative press on Vista, that hardware manufacturers are allowing Microsoft to bully them into not selling XP anymore, but only selling Vista.  I realize that forcing the upgrades to Vista will, in the end, put more money in Microsoft's pocket, but if no one is interested in Vista and they can't get a computer without it, most people seem to not be buying new hardware (because they can't get XP), which has to be hurting the bottom line for these hardware vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also freaks me out the kind of stuff that Microsoft has put into Vista in terms of DRM and the "modular OS" and the fact that they can do damn near anything they want with &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; computer.  Almost makes it feel like you buy the computer and OS, just to end up renting it from Microsoft anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can honestly say that, despite it's many shortcomings, I didn't mind XP too much (I prefer Windows 2000 to it, and, of course, Linux and OS X to that).  It had many &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; problems, sure, but it still let me use the computer the way I wanted to (more or less) and didn't get all snotty when I did things that maybe Microsoft wouldn't have liked, such as installing Cygwin, etc.  But for them, via the DRM "machine", to potentially lock out applications like Cygwin and others on a whim freaks me out.  I can honestly say that although I still dual-boot XP here, I will never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; use Vista.  And if I can't buy a machine without it, then I won't buy the machine.  Plain and simple.  Microsoft needs a good economical kick in the arse to make them realize that what they're doing is beyond moronic... it's downright morally wrong.  For them to dictate the terms of how I use my own computer is beyond egotistical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, some of you may be snickering right now knowing that I use OS X and it has it's own issues but they are nothing like what Vista is imposing.  The only DRM on Apple (thus far) is iTunes and I have a choice there as to whether I want to buy from the iTunes store or not.  I can still easily rip my own CDs, or download any music from any disreputable source I like, and still be able to use it in iTunes.  Will DRM in Vista now, or in the future, allow the same?  Somehow, I can see Vista's "paperclip" (or demonic imp perhaps) popping up when I insert a legitimate Opeth CD to make mp3's of telling me that if I don't buy it from the Zune Marketplace or whatever they call their iTunes-wannabe, I can't listen to it in my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Linux on the desktop leaves a lot to be desired, but to be honest... I'd rather put up with it's rough edges than Vista's dictatorial crap any day.  Oh, and Apple?  I hope you're paying close attention to the fallout from Vista and be damn sure you never try to pull the same stunts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Upgrading to 2007.1 RC1 (well, current cooker anyways)</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/upgrading-to-20071-rc1-well-current-cooker-anyways.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-03-17T18:21:00-06:00</published><updated>2007-03-17T18:21:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-03-17:/blog/upgrading-to-20071-rc1-well-current-cooker-anyways.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to give the new Mandriva 2007.1 RC1 a try.

Since I mirror cooker, I figured I'd do a straight "urpmi --auto-select" upgrade on my 2007 box rather than downloading a bunch of ISOs.  So it's not really RC1 (really, with a few hundred packages being changed since the RC was cut, I think calling it a beta might be better but whatever), but it's cooker current as of 10:00am my time (did a quick rsync to make sure I had the latest of everything).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a GNOME user when I'm using Linux, so I was logged into GNOME when I fired up gnome-terminal, did a "urpmi.removemedia -a" then added the main/release and contribs/release media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the install went well.  930 packages, 1861MB, and 42 minutes later, the system was upgraded.  urpmi told me it was going to remove libpython2.4-devel (due to unsatisfied python == 2.4.3), didn't want to upgrade suspend-scripts due to missing wltool, and was going to remove libguile12 due to an unsatisfied guile == 1.6.8.  Fine, no worries although python could concern some people (don't worry, this is because python 2.5 is being installed, so you get libpython2.5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the install failed at package 928 of 930 due to libiso9660_5 being missing (either not on the mirrors or has been replaced and the hdlists hadn't been upgraded).  No worries.  Doing another "urpmi --auto-select" afterwards installed another 4 packages... wierd... by my count there should have been 1 package left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the wierdness begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for one, 2007.0 updates have kernel 2.6.17.12mdv.  But 2007.1 only has 2.6.17.11mdv.  Huh?  Someone should fix that pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade didn't install x11-driver-input-evdev, which was one of two errors preventing X from starting.  The second was a X version mismatch on the fglrx driver.  I believe I had installed the proprietary ATI drivers with ATI's package way back when.. been a while so I don't really remember.  Anyways, I added the non-free/release media and installed dkms-ati.  Still didn't work.  After using urpmf, I determined I needed to install the ati package as well (why this isn't a requirement of dkms-ati I have no idea).  Once that was done, X would start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hostname got removed.  My machine has the cool name of "cerberus"... imagine my dismay when it had the (ultimately boring) name of "localhost".  Ugh.  A trip to the Mandriva Control Center fixed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect urpmi removed xscreensaver and didn't tell me.  Why?  Well, I had screensavers before, and I also had the screen lock after 10 minutes.  I had to urpmi xscreensaver.  Screensavers are back.  xlockmore is already installed.  Screen still doesn't lock.  When I tell GNOME to lock the screen it does a whole lot of nothing.  Doesn't even kick in the screensaver.  Too bad, because I wanted to watch Bob burn (Xflame).  And the "power management" button in the screensaver preferences does nothing.  I should have checked after I'd been away from the machine for a few hours whether or not the monitor got turned off.  Heck, the screensaver preview doesn't work either.  Something is broken here I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't played too much more with it to poke around with other stuff.  vmware server works, so I'm happy... the rest doesn't much matter provided that a) zsh works, b) gnome-terminal works, and c) vmware-server works.  Beyond that, I don't much care (although a non-working screensaver is a little irritating... so is the fact that the session doesn't lock).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNOME doesn't look any different.  I can't really determine quickly what's different about it.  KDE looks ok; I can tell it's changed.  Nothing overly exciting there, but KDE doesn't do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to see if I could make Metisse work.  I got it enabled, then tried to log in with GNOME and it just sat there.  CTRL-ALT-BKSPACE'd out of that, tried KDE and now I have 9 virtual desktops.  Ok...  I can switch them, but I didn't see any of the fancy transitions that I noticed in the demos.  I suppose there's more to be done to configure it, but nothing in MCC or the menus jumped out at me as a "Metisse configuration tool".  Maybe there isn't one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the upgrade went pretty smooth.  All things considered, I think this is the best verison upgrade I've done yet (normally I do a wipe and reinstall).  Everything, except the screensaver, came up just as good as before.  At quick glance, doesn't look like much has changed from a GUI perspective.  I haven't done much looking under the hood to see what else has changed...  I'll leave that for later tonight or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Using mutt on OS X</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/using-mutt-on-os-x.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-03-09T16:01:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-03-09T16:01:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-03-09:/blog/using-mutt-on-os-x.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I put up a &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/Using_mutt_on_OS_X"&gt;full-feature tutorial on how to use mutt on OS X&lt;/a&gt; (most of it is applicable to any other OS, of course... there are very few bits that are OS X specific).

&lt;p&gt;This issue was noticed when I set up the mock Mandriva wiki a few months ago and I could never figure out where the problem was coming from (the server is at a co-location, behind two different OpenBSD firewalls with three switches in the closet.. nevermind all the junk in front of that).  Well, today it got figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out the issue was with an OpenBSD firewall and the interface packets to my machine were being sent through was on a gigabit intel pro card.  Now, I don't know if the problem is with the card itself or with OpenBSD's drivers for it, but after a whole lot of trouble-shooting and shuffling things around, we finally put the network my machine is on via a different interface in the OpenBSD firewall, rebooted it, and all of a sudden all of the problems disappeared.  I've noticed that as more people upgrade to distros shipping this new kernel, more issues were showing up... not only could regular desktop users not connect to my sites, but some sites delivering mail would timeout, etc.  I'm suspecting this is due to upgrades of kernels on those machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this is all fixed now.  For the first time in I don't know how long, I can visit my websites via my Mandriva desktop.  Wow, is it nice to have that again!  So... welcome back all you 2.6.17+ using people!  It's a nuisance that the kernel developers knew about this issue and didn't care to do anything about it.  Sure, the problem isn't technically with the linux kernel, but when you go from 2.6.16 (which worked fine) to 2.6.17 (which didn't) and they're aware of it and poo-poo the situation, well... that's not fun for anyone (it's not like I, and many others like me, can go and tell people to change the TCP window scaling value on their desktop machine for anyone who wants to visit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well... the nuisance, for me at least, is dealt with.

There really wasn't much of anything overly special on that site and it's largely been neglected so this was a good way to push everything together into one site.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I started using Linux, I was using OS/2.  I went to it from DOS/Win3.1... skipped Windows95 altogether.  OS/2 was the absolute best OS back in the day (as far as I'm concerned) and being a nostalgic (and sometimes bored) idiot, I decided to pull out my Warp 4 CDs and see if I could install it in Parallels.  I succeeded... to some extent.  Now that I have OS/2 installed I can honestly say I have no idea what I would ever use it for anymore.  I also couldn't get the (what should be) the simplest things installed (i.e. OS/2 builds of Firefox, even something as simple as lynx was crapping out on me).  Granted, I didn't spend too much time tweaking it (I'm not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bored).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, here's a quick rundown of the things I had to do in order to make it work.  Had to do a bit of googling to find all the bits, and this is what worked for me (note, this is Parallels on OS X)...Ok, here's the steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Copy the disk images from the Warp4 CD; in particular you want DISK0.DSK, DISK1-CD.DSK, and DISK2.DSK, in the /diskimgs/os2/35/ directory
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; rename each of these files to a .dmg file (i.e. DISK0.DSK becomes disk0.dmg) -- make sure you can mount each of them in the Finder
&lt;li&gt; if you can mount them, unmount them and rename them to .fdd (i.e. disk0.dmg becomes disk0.fdd)
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Create the new virtual machine, set the OS type to OS/2.  Set the primary drive to be 2GB (I used 1.9GB to make sure OS/2 could read it)
&lt;li&gt; Set the CD drive to &lt;i&gt;/Library/Parallels/Tools/vmtools.iso&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Set the floppy drive to &lt;i&gt;~/Desktop/disk0.fdd&lt;/i&gt; or wherever you saved your floppy disk images
&lt;li&gt; Make sure the machine is set to boot from the floppy first, then boot the machine.  You'll make your way through the three floppies; when the installer asks for the next floppy, just use *Devices-&gt;Floppy-&gt;Connect Image* and pick the disk it's asking for
&lt;li&gt; When the installer wants the OS/2 CD inserted, do the same thing and use *Devices-&gt;CD/DVD-ROM 1&gt;-&gt;[Drive name]* to have it use the physical CD-ROM (I tried with a disk image created via Disk Utility but it didn't work)
&lt;li&gt; Use the advanced install and format your drive to HPFS
&lt;li&gt; You'll probably have to reboot and go through all these steps again (stupid installer) after you create the filesystem and partition the drive
&lt;li&gt; When you've got everything installed, use the *GENGRADD* SVGA driver for the graphics card
&lt;li&gt; For the TCP/IP settings, when it comes to it, connect the floppy device to &lt;i&gt;/Library/Parallels/Tools/vmtools.fdd&lt;/i&gt; to have it pull the network driver off the image; this should be the "RTL8029 PCI Ethernet Adapter" (PCIND.OS2).
&lt;li&gt; Once the install is complete, reboot, and use the vmware tools installer once you've brought OS/2 up in order to install the mouse driver (&lt;i&gt;D:\DRIVERS\MOUSE\OS2\INSTALL.CMD&lt;/i&gt;)
&lt;/ul&gt;

I must admit, I find it pretty neat that I have OS/2 running again.  It looks awful, the UI is horrid, but it's the OS/2 I fondly remember (although I don't remember it looking quite this bad).  At any rate, I spent a bit of time trying to download stuff off of hobbes to get installed and pretty much none of it worked, and I didn't have the patience to try and figure out what I needed to do to make it work.  It was enough that I got it installed.  I had tried once a few years ago in VMware and couldn't make it work.

The individual whom I was speaking with ("Intensity") was wondering why there needed to be YASLD (Yet Another Secure Linux Distro).  Interested, I was reading through the page to see if there was anything unique... you know, something no other secure distro offered that might give it some appeal.  Well, about the only thing I can see that would make this thing any more interesting than any others is that this one is based on Slackware.  AFAIK, there is no other hardened distro out there based on Slackware.  They also seem to be working on some custom configuration (web-based) tools.  Well, that seems par for the course, doesn't it?  I mean, most distros have some means of configuration other than commandline (well, except maybe Annvix!).  Anyways, it looks like, judging by the age of web pages and forums setup on sourceforge that this started around October 2006.  Now the question is why?  There are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; hardened Linux distros out there... this one has four developers, very little in the way of well-setup infrastructure (no mailing list archives, for instance).  Now, I'm not saying this to discourage the Hardened Linux developers... they are certainly entitled to create their own distro, but having worked on my own for almost 4 years now, I have to wonder about the rationale behind it.  It's not easy having your own distro, and it really isn't easy for something as "niche" as this.  And looking at their &lt;a href="http://hardenedlinux.sourceforge.net/?sub=features"&gt;features page&lt;/a&gt; there's nothing that jumps out at me to make me go "YES!  &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the secure distro I need to be using!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me re-iterate.  There are a lot of secure distros out there:  Annvix, Openwall GNU/Linux, Trustix, EnGarde, Devil-Linux, OpenNA Linux, Adamantix, Phayoune Linux, IPCop Firewall, Hardened Linux From Scratch, ALT Linux, and probably a whole lot more that I can't think of right now (or that aren't showing up in a quick google of distrowatch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think for a hardened distro (especially for something as niche/specific as server/firewall/etc.-only needs to have some really good features to make it stand out from the crowd.  Otherwise I think the developer(s) interested in starting a new distro would be better off looking for a distro with similar ideas and goals and contribute/develop for it.  No, maybe "good" features is wrong.  It needs to have unique and compelling features... something to make it stand out from the crowd.  And looking at Hardened Linux I don't see anything compelling or unique there.  Of course, the same could be said about a whole bunch of distros out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just makes me wonder what the rationale is if you can get everything you're offering in another similar distro.  To go through all that effort and time to end up with a product that is 95% identical to another product just seems wierd to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Sidebar for mutt</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/sidebar-for-mutt.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-02-15T15:01:00-07:00</published><updated>2007-02-15T15:01:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2007-02-15:/blog/sidebar-for-mutt.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Found this really nice patch for mutt today, it's a &lt;a href="http://www.lunar-linux.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44"&gt;sidebar patch&lt;/a&gt; that adds a list of mailboxes to your mutt view so you can see which mailboxes has new mail in it, the current count of messages in each, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to googlebot and the load it was generating on my server at the colo, I had to move svn.annvix.org from my primary webserver to a spare box on my cable line at home.  The problem was if I referred to http://svn.annvix.org/ from home, I was never able to connect to it (browser would return unable to connect), so I figured I needed a way to tell shorewall to redirect anything coming from the local LAN to the firewall to be redirected back through the firewall to the specified machine on the local LAN again.  Sounds like it should be pretty straightforward but it wasn't until I found this entry in the shorewall FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq2"&gt;(FAQ 2) I port forward www requests to www.mydomain.com (IP 130.151.100.69) to system 192.168.1.5 in my local network. External clients can browse http://www.mydomain.com but internal clients can't.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I wrote about this for a TechRepublic tip quite a few months ago and when I did I was pretty ticked that it didn't work on OS X (sshfs absolutely rocks!).  Anyways, the fine folks at Google have created &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/"&gt;MacFUSE&lt;/a&gt; and I got around to installing it this morning.  Very slick.  Unfortunately, the sshfs.app that you can use with it doesn't have a very nice frontend, and this other GUI frontend I found called &lt;a href="http://jan.prima.de/SecureRemoteDisk.html"&gt;Secure Remote Disk&lt;/a&gt; is only marginally better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading a thread on the PathFinder forums (sshfs volumes don't show up as volumes in PathFinder yet although they do in the Finder), I saw a shellscript posted that was a little better than the quicky I whipped up, so it inspired me to write an even better one that puts these GUI apps to shame (I think).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can grab it here: &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/files/sshfsmount"&gt;sshfsmount&lt;/a&gt;.  Save it to disk, make it executable, and put it somewhere like ~/bin or /usr/local/bin.  The options are pretty straightforward, use "sshfsmount -h" to get help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others would ask for donations (ala the Secure Remote Disk fellow), but it took me maybe 20 minutes to whip this up, so I won't ask for any donations.  &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, if you do feel like donating, I won't stop you.  =)  Hit &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/"&gt;the main page&lt;/a&gt; for a PayPal button if you're so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

The touchscreen is nice but it's a phone... so not only do you get facial grease on it, but you also get fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And apps?  What apps?  With Apple being very vague on that front, I'd be waiting a year or two to see what materializes.  I don't want a phone that just syncs with iCal/AddressBook (my Treo does that already), nor do I just want a glorified ipod (got three, thanks, the Treo also plays music).  What I really want is what my Treo has now... the ability to look at and edit excel spreadsheets, word documents, play Bejeweled 2, mahjongg, and sudoko, synchronize with my filemaker pro (exceptionally handy!) and do the hundred other things this goofy little phone does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Apple wins hands down on style... the iPhone is very slick looking.  But when it comes to features... will it be as slick as my Treo?  I dunno.

I've been running mutt under screen for a few weeks now (and irssi) which has been working fine but it wasn't until today that I put two and two together, namely that when I cut-n-paste from a terminal with mutt in it, I was getting a lot of whitespace tacked on to the end.  This was a big pain for cut-n-paste, say, CVE entries that needed to go into a wiki; all that extra whitespace got tacked on.  Well, I stumbled on the fact that if I run mutt outside of screen, this doesn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've spent the last hour googling and trying to find out how to correct this.  I suppose it's due to screen running as a vt100 terminal, but I can't figure out a way to tweak it or tell screen to behave, other than to use the "-O" option.  If I use "screen -O" then it works fine, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; I loose all the color settings in mutt (ie. title bar, status bar, highlight lines that go to the end of the screen).  With -O, my top bar is missing, my bottom bar is incomplete, and my highlight lines only highlight the actual text on the line, not to the end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaargh!  Essentially, I'm half-way there, but I can't stand such an ugly looking mutt using it that way.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?  Right now I'm not going to run mutt under screen, and I'm aliasing "screen" to "screen -O" because that'll prevent me be logged into another system and cut-n-paste from one term to another with a bunch of extra whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm... some more playing, now this is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I use "screen -S mutt -t mutt -O" then at the shell open mutt, then the cut-n-paste works properly, but mutt is ugly and I miss my status lines, etc.  But if I use "screen -S mutt -t mutt -O /sw/bin/mutt" (so it executes mutt directly) then mutt looks fantastic, but cut-n-paste adds all the extra white space.  Maybe there's some bad mojo with mutt and screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to google some more I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; well, that was quick.  Once I figured out where the issue was coming from, it's definitely a mutt/screen interaction issue and I found the answer in the &lt;a href="http://wiki.mutt.org/?MuttFaq/Appearance"&gt;mutt FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.  The fix is to add this to ~/.screenrc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

I've just spent nearly two weeks converting content from the Mandriva development wiki (http://qa.mandriva.com/twiki/bin/view/Main) in TWiki to the new MediaWiki setup at http://mdv.vmlinuz.ca/.  That will not be the final home for the new wiki, of course... currently we're waiting on IS Team to get MediaWiki setup and integrated with the authentication system used with the other Mandriva sites.  I'm told it should probably be up and ready next week at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those of you who work on the development wiki, please do your work on the new site instead.  I've asked Warly to make the old one read-only to keep the content available in case I've missed anything, but to prevent people from editing what's already been imported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a combination of a &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/files/twiki-convert.pl"&gt;perl script&lt;/a&gt; that Thierry wrote to do the bulk of the dirty work and a &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/files/TWiki_to_MediaWiki_Converter"&gt;BBEdit Text Factory&lt;/a&gt; as well (I wrote the latter based on the former after about a week since the perl script relied on a Mandriva perl module and I didn't feel like installing that on OS X).  I've made both the script and the Text Factory available for download for others to other use or just peek at.  The problem with these scripts is they're not the be-all and end-all, especially on a site with many different contributors... everyone seems to have their own style and syntax and boy does that make conversion interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from proofing, spell-checking, and styling, the wiki is pretty much done.  As it stands, it looks much better than the TWiki did and the performance seems much better as well.  Of course, once the proofing and spelling and everything else is done, it will look absolutely killer.  We have a lot of content (379 pages to be approximate (well, according to MediaWiki's stats)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, enjoy the new wiki.  I know I sure like it better.  But I must admit... I've lost pretty much all interest in even looking at a wiki for a while... kinda like when you've eaten pizza for two weeks and don't want to eat it again for the better part of a year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva wiki in the works</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/mandriva-wiki-in-the-works.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-11-25T20:29:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-25T20:29:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-11-25:/blog/mandriva-wiki-in-the-works.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've decided that since it's been over a month now and no one has decided yet on what software to use (apparently there's one hold-out for xwiki while everyone else wants mediawiki... hello...

VETO!), I've decided to make it monumentally in mediawiki's favor by cramming so much bloody content onto the &lt;a href="http://mdv.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;in-the-works conversion site&lt;/a&gt; I initially set up to make it feel like it's not worth it throw all my effort away.   =)  How's that for sneaky?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Errr.. hmmm... admitting this on my blog defeats the purpose of being sneaky doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, long day.  Two days actually.  I've converted a fair chunk of content over in the last two days...  a week of that would probably result in the entire twiki site being converted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my eyes are tired and my arms (and ass) are sore so I'm gonna go read a book or just listen to my ipod.  Had to note, however, that this isn't being let go...  using Thierry's conversion script that we both worked on (he more than I) I've been cruising.  It's not 100%, but it's pretty good and I've probably gone 2-3x (if not more) faster because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of work yet, but I think it's coming along nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

Not a huge deal, but a PITA.  So I decided I was going to look into running the "stack" on my mbp directly, so I could do all the development locally... great for when I'm at the in-law's place without a direct internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been reading about &lt;a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php"&gt;MAMP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/a&gt;, both are providers of the "stack" for OS X (XAMPP actually also works on Linux and Windows too).  I chose MAMP because it has a more recent version of PHP available (5.1.6 vs. 5.0.5 in XAMPP).  I'm hoping they'll update soon to 5.2.0 since that's what my webserver will be running in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with MAMP, however, is that you have to run the stupid MAMP application to actually start the apache and mysql daemons; it doesn't provide support to have them started on their own at system startup.  &lt;a href="http://forum.mamp.info/viewtopic.php?t=68"&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; on the MAMP forum gives you some clues, but not enough.  For one, they set it up as an "on-demand" thing, triggered by a user login.  This is fine for a desktop machine I suppose, but not so good for someone, say, running an Xserve and using MAMP as their production "stack".  So I took the info, did some fiddling, and got it to start at boot.  Unfortunately, when you install MAMP (as a user), some ownership of files go to you that can't go to you if you want it to start as a system service.  You'll need to add two plists to /Library/LaunchDaemons (I'll get to that in a moment), and you'll also have to change some ownership of files.  The first thing to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo chown -R mysql:admin /Applications/MAMP/db/mysql
$ sudo chown -R mysql:admin /Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to grant ownership of the database files to user mysql (which is what the database will run as instead of, say, user joe (aka YOU)), and the second is to give user mysql write permissions to the temporary file directory where mysql wants to create it's socket file (so as to communicate locally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plists you need are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/files/6/62/Apache2.plist"&gt;/Library/LaunchDaemons/apache2.plist&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/files/5/54/Mysql.plist"&gt;/Library/LaunchDaemons/mysql.plist&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second assumes you'll be running mysql on the standard mysql port (and not the wierd non-standard port they use by default).  Reboot and you're good to go (make sure those plist files are owned root:admin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was one good thing... don't even get my started on the new Zend Studio 5.5 beta that is "supposedly" a universal binary (hello... we need universal &lt;em&gt;libs&lt;/em&gt; too people!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Fricking spam</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/fricking-spam.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-10-30T23:11:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-10-30T23:11:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-10-30:/blog/fricking-spam.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've had it.

My spamassassin/RBL lists/etc. setup was working really well for a long time but now more and more spam is getting through and it's nothing if not pissing me off.  Strange thing is, I get a lot more spam on my Mandriva email than I do on the personal side, but more spam makes it to the folders on the personal side than Mandriva (mind you, with Mandriva's mail I'm using Mail.app with the excellent SpamSieve application which is catching the 10% that Mandriva's servers is letting through).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the personal side, I'm going back to TMDA.  Screw it.  I was using it and had 100% success with it for months... but I was also getting my Mandriva mail forwarded to my personal account, which was causing issues (when you email security_at_mandriva.com you really should have your mail get through and not a challenge-response).  But, now that my personal and Mandriva mails are 100% separate (even to the point of two distinct email clients), it's back to TMDA and the good life on the personal side of my mail.  SpamSieve works awesome with Mail.app and I know TMDA will work awesome on the mutt side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd make SA more aggressive, but I don't want to piss off any clients who might like to get... ahem... certain emails.  So although I have my threshold set quite aggressively, it's not as aggressive as I'd like and I'd have to over-complicate my setup to get per-user SA settings in there.  If I have to go through the complexity, I'd rather do it for something I know is 100% effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for all you anti-TMDA folk out there...  when I was running TMDA, the people who complained the most were the people who didn't know me.  Since my personal email is just that, personal, most people will know me and if they wrote to me then it's important to them I get it, and they will reply to challenge-responses (those few who won't be immediately in my whitelist, that is).  For the rest... I don't particularly care if their mails get through.. what they send me is obviously more important to them than me, so if it's that important, they can deal with the challenge-response.. once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is a "follow-up" to the &lt;a href="http://linsec.ca/blog/index.php?/archives/92-Why-Ill-never-use-Linux-for-my-main-desktop.html"&gt;Why I'll never use Linux for my main desktop&lt;/a&gt; blog entry.  Why is a follow-up required?  I didn't think it would be, but apparently a website that doesn't seem too terribly fond of Mandriva has pounced on the comments that Fabrice and I have made regarding the state of Linux on the desktop and because this misinformation has been made, and people seem to actually pay more attention to Distrowatch than to the sources it references, I felt it to be a responsible thing to make a rebuttal to the antagonistic "journalism" of Distrowatch than to ignore it (which I would have preferred to have done).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue in question can be viewed on Distrowatch under the title &lt;a href="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20061002#news"&gt;Mandriva's Anti-PR&lt;/a&gt;.  Of course, the headline is there to grab attention, first and foremost, and in the most negative light possible.  Mandriva anti-PR?  Let's be realistic.  Since when has &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; personal blog become Mandriva PR?  And when was that blog post anti-Mandriva?  It absolutely wasn't.  Let's see how the numbskulls at Distrowatch twisted things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
You wouldn't expect something like this to happen at any time, let alone on the eve of Mandriva Linux 2007 release. Last week, two Mandriva developers went on record saying that "Linux is not ready for the desktop". In a web log post entitled Why I'll never use Linux for my main desktop, Vincent Danen concluded: "This kind of thing is precisely why, for me, Linux belongs on the server. Now if those kernel-developing idiots would get their act together and give us a 2.6 kernel that was a) stable and b) supported for more than a week, then I'd really be pleased." Another Mandriva developer, Fabrice Facorat, agreed. In a post called Linux ready for Desktop? Of course not!, he had this to say: "For me when you have control over the environment and the hardware, Linux is ready: think servers, workstations, thin clients, kiosks. However when you have no control on the hardware, Linux is not ready because it somewhat lacks flexibility."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it, right from the horse's mouth! From two guys who have been working for a Linux company, developing a popular desktop Linux distribution, for years! Yes, that's right, Mandriva Linux is not ready for your desktop! Don't waste your money buying it!
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How sensationalistic is that?  For one, their facts are wrong.  Fabrice doesn't work for Mandriva; he's a volunteer (and a fantastic one at that; I value Fabrice's opinion like few others).  I am the only Mandriva employee here.  Did I say "Mandriva Linux is not ready for your desktop"?  No.  Did I say not to buy it?  No.  How they interpretted my blog post to come up with this is beyond me.  I can see some simple-minded idiot giggling with glee and rubbing his hands as he read, then completely &lt;i&gt;missed&lt;/i&gt; the context of my entry.  Yup, visualization is fantastic.  That's an image I'll carry with me for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
One really has to wonder about the future of a company which happily asks Gaël Duval to leave, yet is quite pleased to keep developers who publicly hint that they consider Linus Torvalds, Alan Cox and other kernel developers "idiots"! A perfect pre-release PR, non?
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-release PR?  I didn't know I was the official voice of Mandriva.  Actually, I don't think I've &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; been anything close to an official voice, much less a PR-spinning individual.  So to call this a PR is... well... beyond stupid.  To hint that Linus Torvalds, Alan Cox, and the other kernel developers are idiots?  Yes, well, I'm entitled to my opinion, &lt;i&gt;non?&lt;/i&gt; (i love that little french spin there).  And yes, I don't retract that opinion, which I can qualify in a moment (I should have qualified it before, sorry, but this is not a new opinion of mine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain things a bit further.  Distrowatch, while I appreciate the things they're trying to do, really need to get their heads out of their collective anti-Mandriva asses and actually &lt;i&gt;read&lt;/i&gt; what people write.  Since they are patently incapable of doing so, I'll reiterate my previous blog post here... or at least the relative parts because it seems to be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For instance, there's all this talk about the 3D Desktop stuff in Mandriva. Well, I like eye candy so I want to check it out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the reason why I was messing with this anyways.  Why did I chose Mandriva?  Well, come on, it's the distro I've been using for the last 7 years, it's the distro I use daily, it's the distro I like the best (and I'm not ashamed to say I've tried many (in fact, at this moment I even have Ubuntu on my Toshiba Libretto which is more or less waiting for me to get around to sticking Mandriva 2007 on it instead)), and it's the distro developed by the company I work for.  It's the obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At any rate I'm less than impressed. Well, with this. Mandriva 2007 seems pretty nice so far (well, I installed RC2 and synced up with cooker right after the install). The 3d desktop is of less importance to me than getting vmware server working on it, but it would have been nice to play with since this is one of the premier features. Sadly, I need a lot more hand-holding than I'm getting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok folks, I know I'm asking the impossible here, but could you actually &lt;i&gt;read&lt;/i&gt; that paragraph?  Oh, you did?  I kindly invite you to read it again.  No, really read it.  Come on, it's written in good english.  It's not too difficult to understand.  &lt;i&gt;READ IT!&lt;/i&gt;  Oh, sorry, didn't mean to get excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does it actually say?  It says that I'm less than impressed &lt;i&gt;with the experience of setting up the commercial ATI drivers&lt;/i&gt; (yes, I'm actually reading it in context, what a novelty!).  It does not say I'm less than impressed with Mandriva.  Nor does it say I'm less than impressed with any experience of Mandriva.  (For what it's worth, the day after I wrote that, I tried with SUSE on the same machine with the same results... no DRI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh!  Oh!  How about this little nugget:  &lt;i&gt;Mandriva 2007 seems pretty nice so far&lt;/i&gt;.  Umm... if I didn't like it, would I say it?  I think most people who know me, by now know that I speak my mind (which has gotten me into trouble on more than one occassion, granted).  If I thought Mandriva 2007 was garbage, I probably would have said so.  (Ok, well maybe not, but I wouldn't have called it nice either).  No, the fact that I called it "pretty nice" implies that I liked it.  You don't call your wife pretty nice if you plan to divorce her.  Well, not if you're honest at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then go on to say that the 3d desktop is of less importance to me, which means I can live without it.  It also means that I can &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; the distro without this feature.  It didn't say I was going to trash the install looking for something easier (which I did end up doing, but didn't find anything easier, and went back to installing Mandriva 2007 back on that same machine and FWIW, I got the 3d desktop stuff working today anyways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm still a) not seeing any anti-Mandriva PR here nor b) seeing how it could be remotely construed as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I don't think the problem with Linux on the desktop is Linux... Linux, and the associated bits and pieces make a fine desktop. It works really really well. The problem is how the desktop compares with other desktops.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, here it is.  Here is exactly where I say that Linux on the desktop is garbage.  Oh... wait a second.  What's this "fine desktop" business?!?  How the heck did that get in there?  Oh, right, I wrote it.  What?  &lt;i&gt;It works really really well.&lt;/i&gt;  What the... heresy!  Someone must be editing this behind my back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you just need a functional, no eye-candy, all business desktop... look no further than any Linux distro with an X server.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Groan.&lt;/i&gt;  Those dang imps are at it again wrecking my perfectly sensible anti-Linux and anti-Mandriva blog entry.  Damn them all!  What is this nonsense?  Here I'm actually &lt;i&gt;endorsing&lt;/i&gt; Linux on the desktop?  That can't be right...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now I'm gonna qualify the only anti-anything part of my blog entry.  Yes, the anti-kernel-developer statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now if those kernel-developing idiots would get there act together and give us a 2.6 kernel that was a) stable and b) supported for more than a week, then I'd really be pleased.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok.  Here's the deal.  Before the 2.6 kernel, it was easy to figure out what was what.  2.2 was stable, 2.3 was development.  When it was done it became the 2.4 kernel.  Then we went to 2.6.  The old style of development made more sense... develop on the 2.5 branch and when it was deemed stable, start the 2.6 branch and work on 2.7 for development.  But this hasn't happened.  Instead, we have a 2.6 kernel that has API changes from version to version, we have massive changes from version to version, we have things like XFS working in 2.6.16 and then causing massive filesystem corruption in 2.6.17.  What the hell is this?  We have a driver in one 2.6 version being changed and renamed in a later version (here I'm referring to the sk98lin driver although I don't think it's impossible that this hasn't happened with other drivers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is there is no possible way anyone can look at the 2.6 kernel as being anything other than a rapidly-moving development kernel.  It has changes that are too intrusive between versions.  It has inexecusable problems that crop up between versions (thinking of XFS here).  It has an insane number of security vulnerabilities.  &lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; is supposed to be the kernel we &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the kernel we want to use.  Why?  Better support for more devices.  Some really nice features.  There are any number of compelling reasons to use the 2.6 kernel, and just as many not to.  Unfortunately, the 2.4 kernel is in major maintenance mode... it's not getting any new features.  Unless you're running a server (and even then), the 2.4 kernel is just plain old too old.  I had resisted moving my servers to the 2.6 kernel for so long, but now I almost don't have a choice.  Better SATA support?  Need the 2.6 kernel.  AppArmor support?  Need the 2.6 kernel.  For the SELinux folks who want that support?  The 2.6 kernel.  Better performance?  The 2.6 kernel.  Newer gigabit drivers?  The 2.6 kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More instability?  The 2.6 kernel.  More insecurity?  The 2.6 kernel.  More problems moving from one "minor" version to the next?  The 2.6 kernel.  Moving from 2.4.16 to 2.4.17 was probably a no-brainer (been a while, I don't really remember).  Moving from 2.6.16 to 2.6.17?  Watch out.. it'll eat your XFS partitions and the data you choose to store on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, I think the kernel developers are idiots.  They're so concerned with new this and new that that they're forgetting the people that actually &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; it.  They're forgetting that not everyone wants to run the equivalent of Mandriva's cooker or Red Hat's rawhide.  Not everyone wants to run a development kernel in production.  What we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; want is a stable kernel that we can use and know will be maintained with minimal and non-intrusive changes for some time to come.  I want a kernel that I can upgrade without worrying what will break or what new userspace tools I need or any other concern besides compiling and rebooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn't going to happen anytime soon.  The kernel developers have essentially left the onus on the Linux vendors to grab a development kernel and attempt to stabilize it themselves, which means backporting fixes because the kernel developers have moved on to the next cool thing.  I understand the "geek" nature here, but they're doing the Linux community a disservice by not simply saying "ok, the 2.6 kernel is done, now it's time to move on to the 2.7 or 2.8 kernel".  Then the 2.4 kernel can be officially retired, and people can maintain (stabilize, provide security fixes for, etc.) a 2.6 kernel that people can feel confident in using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because the 2.6 kernel has been a development kernel for so long, and the 2.4 kernel is minimally maintained, we're basically hooped.  We can use something on the verge of being obsolete, or we can play with a development kernel.  There is no middle ground.  There is no recent stable kernel.  Why is this so hard to figure out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to qualify here that there was some talk of making the 2.6.16 kernel the "stable" kernel but I really wonder how well this is going to work out.  I'd really like it if it did work out, and I really hope that it does, but I think that the decision of a "stable" kernel needs to be made by the entire kernel development team and/or leadership, and I sincerely believe that means that they need to stop playing with 2.6 and move on to another major version number (like 2.7) and then it won't just be a handful of people wanting to do it, but something the entire kernel community stands behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that's enough of that.  This post here is basically to a) maintain that yes, the kernel developers are, in my opinion, idiots and b) that the Distrowatch folks are idiots too.  At least the kernel people can read... seems to me like that basic skill is lost on the Distrowatch folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and for those people leaving comments on the Distrowatch thread who are saying "that's it for Mandriva, time to look at SUSE or Ubuntu", if you're basing that decision on the sensationalistic anti-journalism of Distrowatch and not on your own experiences, then shame on you.  Are you sheep that you do what others tell you without any thought or questioning on your part?  If so, then I pity you.  If you read the Distrowatch "news" and then actually followed the link to read the blog postings by Fabrice and myself, you'd realize that Distrowatch is completely incompetent and incapable of anything even remotely resembling "journalism" or even worthy "news reporting".  And if you read Distrowatch, without reading the blog entries in question, and took it at face value, then I really feel sorry for you because you've allowed someone else to form an opinion for you and have given up your freedom of personal thought to a pack of irresponsible or even, dare I say it, malicious individuals (because their spin on this is either incompetent or malicious... take your pick)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, this is my &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; blog.  This is not a vehicle of Mandriva PR.  This is not even a Mandriva-hosted or Mandriva-sponsored or even remotely Mandriva-related blog.  This is where I have my little corner of the web to speak my own mind.  What I say here is not Mandriva's opinion, policy, or anything else that could be construed as even remotely "official Mandriva".  This is the opinion of one simple guy who happens to work for Mandriva.

So, as a result, I determined to get the ATI drivers working.  The big difference here is that this time I'm using the 32bit Mandriva rather than 64bit; no idea if that's making a big difference but I did find some help doing more googling (and no, there is no /usr/share/fglrx/fglrx.README with the latest ATI drivers so poo on the guy who said I didn't read docs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's a quick HOWTO on getting this stuff up and running (or, at least, how I did):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Grab the ATI commercial drivers from the &lt;a href="https://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894&amp;task=knowledge&amp;folderID=300"&gt;ATI driver downloads page&lt;/a&gt;
2) Follow the instructions on how to install it (essentially "sh ati-driver-install-8.29.6.run" and then follow the instructions)
3) Run "aticonfig --initial"
4) In my case, the aticonfig added a second monitor, I suppose that might be the TV out.  Doesn't really matter.  The big thing I found was that I needed to set "Composite" to "Disable" in the "Extensions" section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  As soon as I did this, glxinfo and fglrxinfo started telling me that direct rendering was enabled and that I was using the "RADEON XPRESS" OpenGL renderer rather than Mesa.  Oh, and make sure that screen0 is set to use the fglrx driver instead of the ati driver (aticonfig setup screen1 to use fglrx, but was still using ati on screen0).
5) You need to install libstdc++5 in order for the fglrx module to load properly (unfortunatley, this package is in contribs); without this I couldn't get the fglrx kernel module to load (perhaps the ATI dkms packages negate this requirement, but I used the downloaded drivers)
6) Once I had rebooted (to make sure the kernel fglrx driver was loaded), then I could run drak3d and enable Xgl and compiz and get the fancy cube and jiggly windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyways it works.  With Xgl and Compiz enabled, however, fluxbox isn't very happy.  Things look nice and slick in KDE, but fluxbox doesn't handle it overly well (dragging a window around leaves a trail so your desktop looks pretty messed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't tried yet with the dkms-ati package yet.  I'll do that later when I have more time.  At any rate, it does work.  I think it was that "Composite" extension that was causing me grief the first time around, and none of the sites I looked at before even mentioned it (finally found it in this &lt;a href="http://www.phoronix.net/forums/showthread.php?t=243"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about FC6).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva development wiki conversion</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/mandriva-development-wiki-conversion.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-09-30T20:47:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-09-30T20:47:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-09-30:/blog/mandriva-development-wiki-conversion.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I brought up, on the maintainers@ mailing list, the question that had been dicussed a few months ago and discussed &lt;a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=mandrake-cooker&amp;w=2&amp;r=3&amp;s=mediawiki&amp;q=b"&gt;on the cooker list&lt;/a&gt; from about April-June, regarding the restructing of the &lt;a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MandrivaLinux"&gt;Mandriva Linux Development Community wiki&lt;/a&gt; with the possibility of moving if from that hideous POS TWiki …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I brought up, on the maintainers@ mailing list, the question that had been dicussed a few months ago and discussed &lt;a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=mandrake-cooker&amp;w=2&amp;r=3&amp;s=mediawiki&amp;q=b"&gt;on the cooker list&lt;/a&gt; from about April-June, regarding the restructing of the &lt;a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MandrivaLinux"&gt;Mandriva Linux Development Community wiki&lt;/a&gt; with the possibility of moving if from that hideous POS TWiki to something a whole lot more extensible and faster, MediaWiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What came of the first discussion (which spanned about three months) was &lt;a href="http://beta.thelinuxfr.org/index.php?title=Accueil"&gt;this demo site&lt;/a&gt; which, while looking pretty, has a whole bunch of (in my mind) flaws to it... primarily that it looks too much like the &lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Welcome_to_openSUSE.org"&gt;OpenSUSE wiki&lt;/a&gt; (it's really really scary how similar they look), and it's also really difficult to read.  Yes, style can be changed quite easily, but I think the focus of this demo site was solely on style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current state of the wiki is awful... it's really difficult to find anything and TWiki is &lt;i&gt;slow&lt;/i&gt;.  MediaWiki is much nicer and much faster and it looks a whole lot better.  So, to that end, I spent pretty much all day (besides heading outside to mow down some flowers to prepare for winter) setting up a new MediaWiki install that can be used instead of TWiki.  Unlike the previous demo, my goal was not to make it look nice (although I don't think it looks bad, and I think it looks better than the current TWiki), but I wanted to make it a logical "structure" so that it would make &lt;i&gt;sense&lt;/i&gt; and things are laid out logically.  The problem with the current TWiki is that there are no real rules to it, and no hierarchy.  It, honestly, looks like the desk in my office.  And, like my desk, makes it damn near impossible to find anything without a lot of effort and cussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously it's far from complete.  The idea I have in mind is to migrate not only the developer wiki but the &lt;a href="http://mandriva.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;Mandriva Community wiki&lt;/a&gt; (which I also host and instigated years ago and which also went through a TWiki to MediaWiki migration) into one big "Mandriva wiki".  When I look at other distributions and their wikis, most of them look pretty good and are well laid-out.  Ours is pure anarchy.  And I think it reflects poorly on us.  Not only that, but why on earth should we have multiple wikis (Community wiki, Developers wiki, Club wiki) when one would suffice and everyone could pool the information and talent to work on a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; project?  A "one-stop resource" for all things Mandriva, if you will.  I suppose, as a result, that it should probably not be hosted on the "qa" machine (with Bugzilla) but on it's own machine or, at the very least, be named "wiki.mandriva.com" instead of qa.mandriva.com/wiki/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, you've been in suspence long enough.  You can check out what I've done at &lt;a href="http://mdv.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;mdv.vmlinuz.ca&lt;/a&gt;.  Please sign up for an account and help convert data from TWiki over to it.  I've started, but it's slow going... if I could devote an entire week to this, I could probably do it all on my own (I did the community wiki in 3 days).  I figure if we have something in place that's pretty close or at least on it's way to being done, and don't squabble over CSS and layout issues, then we have a real shot at replacing that awful TWiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I figure it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission, so I went ahead and started it (which seems to be something of a habit with me and web resources for Mandriva).  Hopefully it'll pan out (most of the other initiatives I've over the years have, so I don't expect this one to be much different).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Of Bugzilla Clients</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/of-bugzilla-clients.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-09-28T22:35:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-09-28T22:35:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-09-28:/blog/of-bugzilla-clients.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Michael Scherer &lt;A href="http://archives.mandrivalinux.com/cooker/2006-09/msg08080.php"&gt;posted to cooker@&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago about putting &lt;a href="http://www.liquidx.net/pybugz/"&gt;PyBugz&lt;/a&gt; a devilishly cool python app for querying a bugzilla database into cooker.

He also emailed me because a while ago I had tried the GUI &lt;a href="http://almworks.com/deskzilla/overview.html"&gt;Deskzilla&lt;/a&gt; product with the Mandriva bugzilla and it didn't work, so he mentioned he had made some changes to our bugzilla and it worked with PyBugz and he thought it might work with Deskzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, he was wrong, it still doesn't work with Deskzilla.  Our bugzilla is pretty hacked up, so it's not too surprising.. it seems to me that it deviates quite a bit from standard bugzilla.  FWIW, Deskzilla works great with the Annvix bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyBugz, on the other hand, seems to be a great query tool for our bugzilla.  It seems to be quite Gentoo-centric (which is ok), so it doesn't work to post a new bug to bugzilla.  It does work to submit a comment to bugzilla, however, and authentication works, which is great.  The problem is, as I just discovered, if you submit a comment to a private bug (our "group" feature... I have no idea if this is from bugzilla or something we added, but you can have bugs appear only to certain groups; we use it for hiding security-related issues), it unsets the group flag (effectively making a security-related bug from being private to public).  Note to self... do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; use PyBugz to post comments to our bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for a query tool it works like a hot damn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(the list is pretty long so I've truncated it, wc tells me there's 177 bugs there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I thought I'd mention how slick this thing is... I'm pretty impressed by it.  Seems to be a lot faster than trying to use the web interface directly and could also be scriptable to create reports of how good (or bad) people are doing with their bugs (not to mention possibly creating customized daily TODO lists)... the possibilities are pretty limitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, for anyone wanting to use this on OS X, you should download the latest python from &lt;a href="http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/index.html"&gt;pythonmac&lt;/a&gt;, which is 2.4.3 (fink only has 2.4.2, and OS X 10.4 comes with 2.3.5).  You'll also want to grab the current svn version of PyBugz (it doesn't work very well with the 0.6 tarball release on the site), and you'll also need to download &lt;a href="http://effbot.org/downloads/index.cgi#elementtree"&gt;ElementTree&lt;/a&gt;, which PyBugz requires (very easy to install python module).  Install the updated Python &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; however and make sure the PATH is setup and such appropriatly before installing ElementTree or it could get installed in the wrong place.  Once you do that, it'll work peachy on OS X.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I'll never use Linux for my main desktop</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/why-ill-never-use-linux-for-my-main-desktop.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-09-25T21:58:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-09-25T21:58:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-09-25:/blog/why-ill-never-use-linux-for-my-main-desktop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This might sound a little harsh coming from a guy who's worked for a Linux company for over six years, but things never seem to get easier.

Oh sure, the stuff that was hard to deal with &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; time is easier, but the new features and the stuff you want to check out &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; time are just as hard as the old crap was last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, there's all this talk about the 3D Desktop stuff in Mandriva.  Well, I like eye candy so I want to check it out.  I don't have a sloucher of a machine either so I know for sure it'll be able to take whatever can be thrown at it.  It's an &lt;a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=1843651&amp;docname=c00619308"&gt;HP Media Centrt PC m7470n&lt;/a&gt; which is essentially an Athlon 64 X2 4200+ (2.2GHz), 2GB RAM, ATI Radeon Xpress 200, 300GB SATA drive, and all the other media/TV tuner crap that came with it (it was a powerful machine for a really smoking good price).  At any rate, it should be able to handle turning my desktop into a funky cube or whatever the 3d desktop is supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well apparently my system is unsupported.  So I spent about 2 hours tonight dicking around, installing the ATI dkms stuff, then realizing I needed the ati rpm, then I had installed the ati-kernel rpm which conflicted with the dkms so I removed the ati-kernel rpm and it still wouldn't work so "dkms status" was telling me nothing so I removed and reinstalled the ati-dkms rpm and in between all of these things I was rebooting just to ensure that stuff would work properly.  Well half the time it wasn't loading the fglrx module in the kernel, then I had to configure with XFdrake, and it wonked my xorg.conf a bit, then things looked better but glxgears was still only giving me 180FPS which I'm pretty sure is bad, and I'm perusing the Mandriva cooker twiki and the output from glxinfo and finally realize that for some bizarre reason direct rendering is not enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I look in my Xorg.log files and lo and behold I see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
(WW) fglrx(0): ***********************************************
(WW) fglrx(0): * DRI initialization failed!                  *
(WW) fglrx(0): * (maybe driver kernel module missing or bad) *

(WW) fglrx(0): * no 3D acceleration available                *
(WW) fglrx(0): ********************************************* *
...
(II) fglrx(0): Acceleration enabled
(II) fglrx(0): Direct rendering disabled
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well WTF?!?  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;AAAARGGGHH!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you shitting me?  I've spent two hours getting the damn ATI kernel module installed, lsmod most &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; tells me that fglrx is loaded and I get this?  Suffice it say I gave up.  But I'm a stubborn guy so I'll qualify that with a "for now". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate I'm less than impressed.  Well, with this.  Mandriva 2007 seems pretty nice so far (well, I installed RC2 and synced up with cooker right after the install).  The 3d desktop is of less importance to me than getting vmware server working on it, but it would have been nice to play with since this is one of the premier features.  Sadly, I need a lot more hand-holding than I'm getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of thing is precisely why, for me, Linux belongs on the server.  Now if those kernel-developing idiots would get there act together and give us a 2.6 kernel that was a) stable and b) supported for more than a week, then I'd really be pleased.  I don't think the problem with Linux on the desktop is Linux... Linux, and the associated bits and pieces make a fine desktop.  It works really really well.  The problem is how the desktop compares with &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; desktops.  If you just need a functional, no eye-candy, all business desktop... look no further than any Linux distro with an X server.  If you want something fun and fancy prepare to either obtain that with wall paper and skins/themes or a few hours of cussing out your machine.  Frankly, I don't have the time to waste on something on that should just plain work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm ranting... =)  It pisses me off that I can't get that cuby thing on my spanky machine in a reasonable amount of time (I'd be more than happy to invest half an hour, but upwards of 2hrs?

That was just about the most fun I've ever had.  First off they put me completely out (and I've never been under anisthetic before) which was... wierd.  I didn't have any real reaction to it like some people I've heard of (or even my daughter when she got put under for some dental work at 2 years old; she came out of screaming and kicking).  So that was ok, but I came out looking like a fat Vincent with a skinny Vincent's body.  My face was probably 2x it's normal size...  it was really swollen.  And they pumped me so full of freezing that it was about 12hrs before the freezing was fully out of my tongue and about 18hrs before my face wasn't frozen at all anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, between a severely swollen face and some pretty good painkillers, I didn't get much done last Wed/Thurs and was able to do some stuff by Friday without falling asleep.  This week has been pretty good, except I think I've developed a sinus infection so I'm on some stronger antibiotics now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting all four wisdom teeth pulled; the two on the bottom were exposed and getting cavities; the two up top were not coming out of the gums, but were quite high up and one of them was even into the sinus cavity (so they ended up doing a graft of some skin from my cheek (the inside, of course) to "plug" the whole they made pulling the tooth out.  Oh, and I actually had two more small teeth growing either on or near the two top wisdom teeth so technically I had six wisdom teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

I downloaded it and was playing around with it (this is a paid upgrade so I've got some time to evaluate it although the upgrade cost is only $30) when I starting looking at the Codeless Language Modules.  I wanted to add RPM spec syntax support to BBEdit quite some time ago and had (wrongly) thought I needed to pull out XCode and actually &lt;i&gt;code&lt;/i&gt; something.  I'm far too lazy for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I downloaded the SDK again today and found these Codeless Language Modules which are just plist files (or XML documents) that tell BBEdit what to highlight and what not to, etc.  BBEdit doesn't have overly sophisticated highlighting anyways (come on, can't we have more than four colors?), but I like a lot of what BBEdit can do and while I normally use joe or vim, sometimes it's easier to whiz my way around a document with my scroll wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, tonight I made a "CLM" for the RPM spec syntax.  Not sure how many people using OS X are also using it to edit .spec files, but since BBEdit can do remote edits via FTP/SFTP I figured what the heck, I'd give it a go.  As an aside, I've also found some CLM's for Mutt's configuration files, Exim's config, and Apache's config.  For other stuff as well, like LUA and whatnot, but there was nothing else I was really interested in.  For anyone out there who's interested, here's my &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bbedit+codeless+language+plist&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N"&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; where I found the other modules from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, for the last two weeks on and off I've been working back there.  Started off trimming about 6-7' in height of the bottom branches so that you can get under there without a face full of pine needles which really opened up the yard.  Since nothing but weeds will ever grow under there, I decided to dump rock under it and Jayden (my daughter) chose this two-inch limestone.  Very nice rock.  Unfortunately, I needed 162 cubic feet to cover it all.  And since a dump truck can't reasonably get back there, I had it dumped in the driveway back there, removed part of the chain link fence, and used a wheelbarrow and a lot of muscle to move all that rock.  I think the results are really good tho and we don't need to get rid of the trees now.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wulfheart/sets/72157594268517301/"&gt;put the pictures up on Flickr&lt;/a&gt; so you can take a look at them if you're interested.

I own a few hundred fantasy books and buy at least 1-2 books a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One author that I've always found interesting is David Eddings.  He's not the most sophisticated author, but he has some good ideas and spins a pretty good yarn although at times it seems a little juvenile.  Regardless, it's plain old good fun to read.  His Belgariad-based books (Belgariad, Mallorean, Belgarath the Sorcerer, etc.) books are all great.  I've read both the Belgariad and Mallereon (both five-book series) twice.  And his other trilogies, the Elenium and the Tamuli are both really good reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been reading some fairly serious fantasy stuff lately tho...  books by Sarah Ash (the "Tears of Artamon" trilogy is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it!), Terry Goodkind's latest, Steven Erikson's "Malazan Books of the Fallen" series (amazing read!), and R. Scott Bakker's "The Prince of Nothing" trilogy (also a really unique and extremely interesting fantasy trilogy).  Then I started reading Edding's "The Dreamers" series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after 20 pages into "The Elder Gods" I was pretty much ready to toss it out the window or, at least, go to the nearest second-hand bookstore and trade it in (and the other two books in the series that I have).  It wasn't fun or entertaining, it was juvenile and stupid...  gods riding around on lightning bolts without a clue about what's going on, talking like idiots, etc.  Well, I persisted and made it to part two of the book which, thankfully, no longer deals with those idiot gods and deals with good old human beings (and it only took me 53 pages of idiocy to get there).  It's still not nearly up to par with the Belgariad and friends, but it's at least passable.  The last few books I've read I literally devoured... I read the Sarah Ash trilogy in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I read too many really good books lately or is Eddings starting to lose it?  So far I'm really disappointed in this book... and this is a first for any of his books.  If he doesn't manage to pull this one through, it and the next two books in the series are going down the street to trade in for some other used books.  Beware sucky authors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, some really good authors that I recommend are the above noted Sarah Ash, R. Scott Bakker, Steven Erikson (this guy is amazing... has to be one of the best stuff I've ever read).  I'd also recommend two relative newcomers to the genre: Robert Newcomb and David Farland...  Newcomb has the same kind of easy read style as Eddings, but a lot more serious (and gory) and Farland has some really unique ideas... very good stuff.  I'd also recommend anything by Sara Douglas and Terry Goodkind (my wife's favourite), and damn near anything by Margaret Weis &amp;amp; Tracy Hickman (those Dragonlance books rock... Margaret, I love you!!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Availability of info: shadow vs tcb</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/availability-of-info-shadow-vs-tcb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-08-25T09:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-08-25T09:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-08-25:/blog/availability-of-info-shadow-vs-tcb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The web cracks me up.

I've been writing for &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/"&gt;TechRepublic&lt;/a&gt; for about 6-7 years now, and every month I write these little tips called "TechMails".  They don't pay a whole lot, but I enjoy doing it as it gives me a reason to look at new and different things, which keeps me (moderately) fresh on new stuff that's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of adding &lt;a href="http://www.openwall.com/tcb/"&gt;tcb&lt;/a&gt; support into &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/"&gt;Annvix&lt;/a&gt; recently, I used that as a TechMail topic that went up just a little while ago.  TechMails don't allow me the depth that I'd like to get, so they sometimes end up being a quick pass at something intended to get the reader interested in something they may never have heard of before and go check it out for themself if what I've written about sounds interesting to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this morning I see on Linux Today a title that looks awfully familiar, so I go check it out and it leads me to &lt;a href="http://www.builderau.com.au/program/linux/soa/Migrating_from_shadow_passwords_to_tcb_in_Linux/0,39028297,39269540,00.htm"&gt;this article on Builder AU&lt;/a&gt;.  Now, Builder AU seems to be the "australian" Builder.com which is owned by CNET, as is TechRepublic (I've written a few things for Builder.com in the past too).  It just cracks me up that the TechMail originally written for TechRepublic with it's home &lt;a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com/5100-1035-6107316.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; ended up on the Australian version of Builder.com.  The title of the article, btw, is "Migrating from shadow passwords to tcb in Linux" and I really recommend it to anyone who (or any distro) that wants to step up the local password security of their system/distro.  It works &lt;i&gt;fantastic&lt;/i&gt;.  (Thanks, Solar!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FWIW, if anyone wants more info, it's pretty easy to implement although it does require a few compiles/recompiles and a wee bit of patching.  The original article on TechRepublic there covers a bit, the Openwall tcb page covers more, and the &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/index.php/Documentation/tcb"&gt;Annvix documentation on tcb&lt;/a&gt; covers some more functional implementation areas (a HOWTO, of sorts, on how to get the system using tcb after everything is built and installed).&lt;/p&gt;

I've even been known to buy copies of distros just to check them out (well, I've bought SUSE and YellowDog and downloaded the rest... particularly because those ones were available locally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having messed around with a few distros these last few weeks, mostly for some comparisons for Annvix (install size, "out-of-the-box" memory usage, etc.). I've come to the conclusion that Linux desktops are getting fatter, slower, and more buggy.  Some, like the latest SUSE, I couldn't even get to install in vmware without a boat-load of work, and even then I only managed to do it once (I knew I should have taken notes).  When I played with FC4 it seemed ok, but I just don't like the feel of Red Hat/Fedora... never have.  I admire the work they do, for the most part, but the distro just seems spartan to me.  I'm probably not being overly fair as I've used Fedora for maybe a maximum of 5 hours... 3 of those I'm sure were helping my dad get it installed on his system.  I've also heard that FC5 is a lot worse than FC4 was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Ubuntu had some wierd install issues.  I have it running on my Libretto since it seems to be the one distro that will handle all the hardware on that machine and it's ok... Debian-style distros aren't really my thing tho.  I'll give them a thumbs up on hardware support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about my beloved Mandriva?  Well, I have to be careful here as I don't want to get in trouble but... well, I'm a little disappointed with the 2007 beta.  Now, BIG DISCLAIMER!  It's a beta.  I realize this.  There's probably a lot of stuff to be fixed.  Unfortunately, it's still a moving target... there's no such thing as a freeze or a bug-squishing phase or even a phase to make it really solid, or at least, historically there hasn't been.  Here's to change and hoping there will be one.  Because the beta has left me a little... underwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks pretty slick... I like the dual-arch DVD ISO idea... if only it would work properly.  On my amd64 laptop I thought I was installing the 32bit version when, to my surprise, I found out post-install it was the 64bit version and the installer offers me no option to install the 32bit version.  Pity because I can't run my laptop wireless with WPA2 security in 64bit since the 64bit windows drivers I have for ndiswrapper don't support WPA2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other issues with the installer, and some post-install stuff... I'm sure it'll all get fixed at some point.  But I had to jump through some serious hoops in order to make some things work.  Things that the average user wouldn't have a clue about.  I've been doing this a while so it's not hard for me... just time consuming and a PITA.  Especially when things should be at the point where they just WORK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm only 30, but I've been doing the computer thing for a while.  When I was younger (relatively speaking), I enjoyed tinkering.  Figuring out how things worked, debugging, testing, spending all hours of the night getting one thing to work properly was a challenge, and it was fun.  Now I'm too busy.  I want things to just WORK.  (Oh, I'm not ranting about Mandriva here in particular... this goes for all Linux desktop distros).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands right now, I'd rather spend the time I used to spend tinkering with my kid, or reading a book, or playing a game, or hanging out with my wife.  I spend at least 12 hours a day in front of computers working.  I don't want to spend my spare time trying to get a machine to work properly, as that takes away time from other things that at this point I find more fun, more entertaining, and just plain more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see all kinds of new features coming into Linux distros.  There is a massive amount of feature-creep.  There's also a massive amount of bugs and other oddities that really just irritate me now.  I find myself angrier with my Linux boxen these days than I recall being with Windows machines in the past (well, maybe not, but it's getting pretty darn close).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, I think, is differing opinions and the "please everyone all the time" mentality.  I see this over and over again and it's nothing if not problematic.  For instance, on cooker the other day someone was saying that "the people" (whoever they are) want packages... lots and lots and LOTS of packages.  The more the merrier.  He also had the absolutely idiotic notion that maintainers a) use and b) test their packages.  The problem with all of these packages (as if we like to sit around and thump our chests saying "MY distro has 132 more packages than YOURS does!") is that there are more packages and less people interested and willing to use and/or test them.  So distros end up shipping stuff that is half-tested (at best).  I mean, look at the Mandriva beta.  Some of the stuff I found shouldn't have ever been there.  I'm assuming people boot the thing, I'm sure someone has tested the installer before making an ISO with it.. so why are these things not fixed?  I'm thinking they're pretty minor.  Same goes with stuff I found with SUSE.  Good Lord, had no one tried installing SUSE in vmware during beta testing?  If one person would have, they would have seen that it just plain old doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet it was shipped like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I the only person getting tired of seeing half-assed stuff?  Now, again, I need to reiterate here that while the Mandriva beta prompted this, this is something I've been noticing for a long time.  There is a distinct lessening of quality across &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; distros that I've played with (not that I've played with a lot, or even comitted much time to them).  Some people will insist I need to spend more time with something.  I have to respectfully disagree.  If it doesn't work, more or less out of the box (I can deal with some tinkering), I'm not interested.  I don't want to spend two days getting my hardware working properly.  I want to spend two days tweaking my apps, fiddling with skins and desktop backgrounds and themes.  I want to spend time doing fun and interesting things with my computer... not cursing at it because it tells me it can't find some firmware for my network card that the previous version of the distro didn't have a problem with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't Mandriva-specific at all.  In fact, I think the beta, as far as it is, is pretty good for a first beta.  Aside from some installer issues and some boot issues, there doesn't seem to be too much staring me in the face (although my menus seem to be pretty spartan for some reason).  If these things can get fixed for the next beta, I think it'll be pretty good.  Of course, one has to wonder about the converse as well... it's been almost a year that this thing has been in the works so why the really obvious bugs?  (I don't know how the development thing works, in particular to respect to new versions of stuff, stability testing, QA, etc. because I haven't dealt with R&amp;amp;D for years so I have to honestly, from a user's perspective, wonder this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the Linux community has been imitating Windows for so long that they've finally succumbed to things they had Windows beat on a long time ago... things like bloat, things like instability, things like wonky hardware issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'm just tired because I've spent a few hours cussing at installs today... I've installed the 2007 beta, and I also had to install some other versions in vmware (Corporate Desktop 3 and 2006).  All of them have issues.  Hell, every Linux distro I've tried in the last 2 years have had issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering when we're going to stop having issues and start having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to stop ranting and go read my book.

Instead of leaving a comment there and having it lost in the 100+ comments, I decided to respond here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, Bryan is in for a surprise!  His essential argument is community... how mac users are rabid, mean, petty, etc.  And yeah, I can see that.  But come on... to imply that the Linux community is all happy roses?  Give me a break.  Granted, there are a number of "Linux communities", and they tend to be distro-centric, but I've known plenty of petty, pissy, malicious Linux users and some communities are downright nasty.  Of course, Bryan has the first few months of using Linux and it probably looks pretty good so far, and maybe Ubuntu has a better community than some others, but to make a sweeping statement that the Linux community is nicer than the mac one is... well.. naive, and hopelessly optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish him luck.. Linux is, obviously, a great OS and there are some kick ass people in the Linux community.  There's also some pretty rotten, foul, and really evil people here too.  His main argument to switch is "community".  I've found that both communities are largely similar...  the mac community is rabid and defensive... the linux community is rabid and zealous.  I've been dealing with the Linux communty from a "vendor" perspective for over 6 years.  I've been a user for 8.  We have not gotten rid of the zealotry that infected the Linux community 6 years ago.  Hell, it's gotten worse.  A lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to avoid "community" as much as possible.  I find it more irritating than useful.  I use Linux, I support Linux, I consult on Linux, I develop a Linux distro, I do updates for another... I'm pretty much as immersed in Linux as you can get.  I also use a mac.  Unfortunately, on the Linux side I have no choice but to be involved in the community.  On the mac side... I don't bother whatsoever.  Why?  Maybe I'm anti-social, maybe I'd rather have a community of real people... family, friends.. individuals I can deal with on a face-to-face basis without hiding behind a glossy monitor where the only interaction with most people is the click-click of keyboard keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that's not to say I don't have some fantastic "online" friends that I've never met and frankly, I'm disappointed that I couldn't make it to Paris a few weeks back to met some of my "online" friends and co-workers.  "Online" friends aren't a bad thing... but to "hang out" with an online community?  Well, I can do without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't put much stock in the whole community thing.  Yes, peers are useful to obtain help, to give help when required, and to simply learn.. but he makes it sound like he's looking for a bunch of buddies that are less rude than the last bunch of buddies he had.  That makes him switch operating systems?  From a technical standpoint.. Linux and Mac both have their strong suits and downfalls.  I prefer OS X on my desktop, but I won't put anything but Linux on a server.  That's simply personal preference and the fact that I'd rather not tinker if I can avoid it... I have far too much to do to spend 3 days trying to get a fricking wirless card working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my point is about switching operating systems to suit the "community".  This fellow makes software for a living.  I wish him the best of luck but I think once he starts developing Linux software "for-pay" he's going to find the mac community is more willing to pay than the linux community.  And I speak from extensive experience on this point.  It's the Linux community (by and large) that wants everything free, everything better, everything faster, and always at the expense of someone else and never themselves.  Pity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Security vuln in Anthill</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/security-vuln-in-anthill.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-07-04T11:06:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-07-04T11:06:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-07-04:/blog/security-vuln-in-anthill.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is kind of funny but as I was going through my CVE mails to figure out what needs to be patched, I came across CVE-2006-3244, with this reference:  &lt;a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/20838"&gt;http://secunia.com/advisories/20838&lt;/a&gt;.

This was the result of my asking why we are persisting with RSBAC (which can be complicated and very intrusive for a desktop system) when AppArmor is available and it's a lot easier to configure and use.  The answer I got was "we have two months until betas approx and now is too late to change technologies".  Well, to be blunt, I don't buy this at all.  I know that Thierry is working on a drak tool for configuring RSBAC, but knowing how short-sighted we can be at Mandriva at times, I wanted more details.  The bottom line was there would be a tool to configure RSBAC, but no default policies shipped (which means no "out-of-the-box" RSBAC support nor, I'm suspecting, RSBAC being enabled by default).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses two problems for me.  One, if we don't have sensible defaults, the end user has nothing to build up from... everything is done from scratch.  This is ok for the "hackers" who like to fiddle, but people like me who just want to &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; the computer will have to invest a few hours in learning how to configure RSBAC properly and then testing/debugging to make sure the policies don't break things.  The other problem is that if RSBAC isn't enabled by default, how many people will know it exists, and how many will actually enable it?  And once they find out they need to configure it themselves, how many will then promptly turn it off or, worst-case-scenario, enable it, not have it configured, and then not be able to log in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is my analysis of how we (Mandriva) should proceed with RSBAC and if or whether we should use AppArmor and what the TTD (Time To Deliver) would be for both technologies, and what would be involved, as well as the pro's and con's of both technologies.  Considering I've only taken a week (and can't really invest more time into this at the moment or risk the wrath of Stew), this may not be 100% accurate and it certainly isn't complete, but this is the findings I've found so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And rather than post a long message for discussion on the maintainers@ mailing list, and cc'ing the kernel team, I decided to put this here to get a little more exposure and a reference point for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's look at a few of the issues that concern RSBAC and AppArmor independantly, without looking AT what we need to do as a distribution to successfully ship a "hardening technology", be it RSBAC, AppArmor, or both.  Then we'll get into the Mandriva-specific stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, there seems to be a misconception that AppArmor and RSBAC are similar technologies.  They are similar in some respects, true, but they are very different as well.  First off, RSBAC is an "overall" hardening solution.  It has a lot of very cool and very neat features, and the nice thing is that it's modular so it's not an "all or nothing" system.  RSBAC's AUTH, ACL, MAC, and other technologies are great for really restricting the capabilities of various programs and processes.  RSBAC even has an in-kernel authentication system that replaces traditional shadow password management, which is cool.  Obviously, I don't believe it is Mandriva's goal to enable and provide all of these features.  Even Annvix, which is security-oriented, has no plans to enable all of these features, so it stands to reason that Mandriva won't be going the extra mile to have a full RSBAC-provisioned system.  Which is fine.  RSBAC is an overall hardening and securing solution that is proven and reliable.  Unfortunately, the RSBAC docs are geared primarily to RSBAC developers.  In other words, RSBAC documentation is shit for the average joe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AppArmor, on the other hand, has a lot of really great docs.  And it isn't a "system-hardening" system.  AppArmor is more of an application firewall.  It restricts and allows certain capabilities of files and programs.  The documentation even suggests that AppArmor is not really useful for securing all applications, but primarily "forward-facing" programs, and by this I mean network-enabled services that interact with humans and have a high probability that if there is something wrong with the app, it can be contained to operating on certain levels.  For instance, if a problem exists in Apache that allows an attacker to view any file on the system that user apache has access to, using AppArmor we can prevent Apache from looking anywhere beyond it's configuration files and web data.  We can prevent it from looking randomly in /etc (like /etc/passwd, etc.) with some basic policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One distinct disadvantage to RSBAC is the lack of easy-to-use tools, but this is where the drak tool comes in.  The drak tool will, presumably, make it easy to create, manipulate, and delete policies.  This is important because RSBAC's configuration is database-driven to the extent that it's not easily manipulated by "human hands".  On the other hand, AppArmor uses a series of text files to configure itself which can be edited by vim, or any other text editor on the system provided you have sufficient privilege to edit the file.  This does, of course, make the policies more susceptible to tampering, but good use of permissions and ACLs could reduce this probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well, with RSBAC, you can make root as privileged as user joe meaning that root can have as much, or as little, privilege as you like.  No such provision exists with AppArmor, meaning you need to realize root is still all-powerful and no amount of permission manipulation and ACLs will prevent someone who has gotten root privileges from borking your system.  The goal, then, is to make sure that no one can get root privs in the first place.  This is much easier to achieve if the system is a single-user system or a trusted multi-user system (like most desktops and/or home computers, and possibly office computers as well).  This is a little tricker to accomplish on a server, but it can be done.  RSBAC provides even better options to achieve this goal, but it doesn't mean it's impossible to do &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; RSBAC.  For instance, simple no-brainers like using SSH keys, appropriate firewall settings, etc. go a lot further to protect a system than some people realize.  None of them are silver-bullets on their own, but each add another defensive layer making it more difficult to appropriate unauthorized access or privilege on a system and, after all, there is no such thing as a fully secured system... everything we do is just adding layers to our "defense-in-depth" to make it as difficult as possible for someone to get anywhere they're not supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as was pointed out to me by some kernel developers and some LKML messages I read, the big perceived disadvantage to AppArmor is that it is path-based whereas other solutions (the LKML context was SELinux, rather than RSBAC, but the points are the same) take an inode-based approach.  The concern here is that someone can take, say, /bin/foo which has some AppArmor policy applied to it, hardlink it, then execute the hardlinked copy without any policy protection.  This too can be avoided for the most part with some decent filesystem mount options.  I say for the most part... it may not be foolproof.  Using the inode, of course, presents it's own challenges which will look at in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've had a brief look at both AppArmor and RSBAC, I'll address a few points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the drak tool, and the TTD.  Apparently we have two months to deliver this.  Which is wierd considering the decision to use RSBAC was made last year, AFAIK RSBAC support has been in the kernel since last year, the rsbac-admin tools have been in cooker since last year (in fact, they're in the 2006 release), but the tool is "in the works".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we use RSBAC, the assumption is we need a tool to configure it.  If we switched to AppArmor we'd need a tool too.  So either way, a tool needs to be written.  My understanding is it's currently being worked on, but isn't done.  So there might be a bit of a time-loss based on what's already been done, but I think the end result of a tool geared towards AppArmor versus one geared towards RSBAC would take less time.  For one, the RSBAC tool will be far more complicated due to how RSBAC handles it's configuration data.  With an AppArmor tool, you just need to manipulate plaintext files.  Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSBAC, on the other hand, requires more work.  For one, you need to either obtain all the configuration data from the rsbac.dat database in realtime to allow the user to manipulate them or you need to maintain a private plaintext copy of this that the tool can read and write.  Also remember RSBAC privilege; if a user makes it so that root can't execute RSBAC-related commands, then presumably root won't even be able to configure RSBAC with our tool (the preferred method of configuring RSBAC is to use the secoff (or uid 400) user).  So then we need to make our tool run as user secoff, which means we at the &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt; need an RSBAC policy to permit this, or use sudo/su to do it (but, again, a default policy would need to be in place to permit this).  Already the complexity is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's assume for the moment that we maintain our own private text configuration for all RSBAC policies and commands.  The advantages are this is easy to parse, easy to write, and then a backend process could be used to take that data and apply all the policies appropriately.  This could be a good thing, but it also precludes the use of normal RSBAC CLI tools because if a user makes changes on their own, our configs will be out of sync.  FWIW, this is how MNF handles it's configuration and I think it's a piss-poor way of doing it because you force the user to either a) use the tool exclusively or b) use the CLI tool(s) exclusively.  There is no middle ground because if you configure something with the tool, make changes with the CLI, the next invocation of the tool overwrites everything.  Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for our tool to be effective it needs to read data out of the RSBAC database, something that I'm assuming can only be done by secoff.  (Note, a lot of this assumption, I haven't actually attempted to configure RSBAC in this way to test this theory, so some of this could be flat-out wrong, but I don't think it's too far off the mark).  So our root-executed tool then needs to have privileges to get the data from user secoff (default policies again), then needs to manipulate the configuration as the user is changing/adding/deleting stuff (probably using a temporary configuration file of some sort), and then the tool needs to take the final changed configuration set, hand it off to secoff which would then run another tool to reapply all the policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're paying attention, you'll see that not only does there need to be multi-user interaction (root and secoff), but all of a sudden we're using two tools now.  One is the GUI configuration tool, the other is the "policy applicator" tool.  There would probably need to be a "policy extractor" tool as well.  Three tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here is where it becomes more interesting.  Remember the whole "inode is better than path-based" argument I noted above?  Remember the kernel developers telling me this was a good thing, trying to tout the whole "inode is better for security" drivel?  In theory this is great, and in practice for a well-supervised system this may be true.  But for a moving target (remember, RSBAC is to go into 2007, a desktop system, not Corporate Server 4 or a similar server/slightly-hardened system), like  a desktop, this isn't as useful, nor as easy to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little illustration should indicate my point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@ares tmp]# echo foo &gt;1; echo "1 is inode `ls -i 1`"; \
echo bar &gt;2; rm -f 1; echo cat &gt;3; echo foo2 &gt;1; \
echo "1 is inode `ls -i 1`"; echo "2 is inode `ls -i 2`"; \
echo "3 is inode `ls -i 3`"
1 is inode 4349024 1
1 is inode 4349026 1
2 is inode 4349025 2
3 is inode 4349024 3
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this little bit of silliness is doing is replicating what could/would happen during an RPM upgrade.  You'll notice we created "1" first then checked it's inode, then we created "2", deleted "1", created "3", then created "1" again.  You can see that the end result is that file "3" obtained the original file "1"'s inode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's nice, but rather meaningless unless you put it into context.  Assume "1" is /bin/login.  You have a system-wide default to disallow the use of /bin/login by anyone, then an exception to allow user joe to use it.  If /bin/login is replaced and it's inode changes, then the policy on /bin/login is now applied to a different file (or an unclaimed inode).  So /bin/login has the system-wide default on it, which is to disallow logins.  Well now no one, including joe, can login.  This could be used for any single file with a specific capability, ACL, or other policy applied to it.  Note that AppArmor, with it's (ridiculed) path-based approach wouldn't care about this.  /bin/login is /bin/login, regardless of the inode.  The AppArmor policies would continue to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking with the RSBAC developers and others on freenode, they indicated that in a situation like that, they just re-applied their policies.  Or, as one fellow said, he would reboot into a maintenance kernel, re-apply the policy (since he wasn't able to do it on his regular RSBAC-enabled kernel), then reboot again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask you... is this is a good thing to ask the user to do when, say, Evolution gets updated?  How about Firefox?  Hell, Windows doesn't even require a reboot when you upgrade firefox!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't really an option, as far as I'm concerned.  So the sensible thing would be to have a working copy of the policies (these fellows have a shellscript to apply policies... remember writing your own iptables/ipchains firewall rules in "firewall.sh"?  same idea applies).  With a copy of these policies we can hack rpm to, in some way, execute at the end of every single rpm installation transaction the policies.  I suppose it could be done after every installation (ie. urpmi install, so after a group of rpms), but that could possibly cause issues, even if they're temporary because polciies might be in flux and a package requiring a protected file may be invoked which was previously installed/upgraded and may have a misapplied policy).  Ideally, running the policy after every sole rpm installation would be good, but the overhead might not be appealing.  A trade off might be to hack urpmi instead, to have it run the "policy re-applicator" after every invocation.  But then the same hack needs to be done for apt, smart, rpmdrake, etc.  Either way, something needs to be done so that after an rpm transaction, the policies can be re-applied, automatically, so as to be transparent to the end user.  Now, this "policy re-applicator" could be the same app used by the drak tool to reapply policies after changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because here we don't have the advantage of runing drakbac (or whatever the tool will be called), we need to &lt;i&gt;get&lt;/i&gt; those policies first.  This means that after every rpm or urpmi/smart/apt/rpmdrake invocation we would need to execute our policy extractor to get the policies, then use that to re-apply them with the policy re-applicator.  Or we're looking back to our private RSBAC configuration file again so we don't have to go through the process of extracting the policies each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't forget that this stuff will need to be done via secoff, which means that (again) default policies need to be in place for rpm or urpmi/smart/apt/rpmdrake to be able to use secoff to a) get and b) apply the policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My head is starting to hurt, so let's switch gears and look at AppArmor in this case.  With AppArmor, you run your tool, configure it (manipulating plaintext files as root), and then you issue a "service apparmor reload" to re-read the plaintext configs and apply the new policies.  Wait... that's it?  Everything can be done as root?  One tool?  One simple command to reload the policies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think again to the TTD on all of this.  Remember we have 2 months.  Do you honestly think that in 2 months we can hack out a series of tools and changes to package managers to manage RSBAC?  Or do you think it more realistic to create one tool for AppArmor?  Seriously, if this would have been looked at when the decision was made to use RSBAC instead of SELinux, a lot of this could have been done by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in all fairness, I believe the RSBAC stuff is doable, even with all the goofiness I outlined above.  SELinux is inode based as well.  And it's being used in Fedora and RHAS or RHES or whatever RH calls their server product.  I suspect they came across these same (or similar) issues and managed them as well.  So it is probable that the same approach taken for SELinux support could be applied here.  For all I know, this capabilitity is available in SELinux or some user-land SELinux patches for rpm and/or other programs.  I don't know... I've never actually looked at SELinux before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a compromised solution could be done.  As I said, I've spent this week reading, playing, and looking around at this stuff.  Because I find the Mandriva kernel extremely painful to work on, I put 2.6.16.22 into Annvix, and added both RSBAC &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; AppArmor, together, in the kernel.  Because I don't much patch the Annvix kernel, these patches are the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; patches for the kernel.  Both apply, together, without rejects.  So it should be possible to do the same thing with the Mandriva kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been running this kernel for a few days, with AppArmor enabled and running, and with some RSBAC features enabled.  The features I disabled were UM (the user mangement stuff), the NET, AUTH, RC, ACL, MAC, PM, and PAX options.  I enabled the CAP, JAIL, DAZUKO, and FF features.  In other words, I'm using the more minor features of RSBAC and not the heavy lifting stuff that would interfere with me using the kernel without a lot of pre-configuration.  Some of the options I disabled could probably be enabled without conflict; I didn't try however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my point here is that the two &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; co-exist.  We could let AppArmor do the "application firewall" work because, quite frankly, it's the easiest and most transparent solution to the end user.  It's also the easiest for the end-user to use.  And since Mandriva is not a rock-solid-ultra-secure distro, the fact that we're using AppArmor for this as opposed to RSBAC won't be a bad thing.  Honestly, I'll take common sense here.  We could enable AppArmor, with default profiles, and have it running on first boot.  Everyone would use it.  We could use RSBAC, likely not have it enabled in every kernel (kernel-secure perhaps?) and have maybe 20% of our users using it (probably a generous figure).  If, as was indicated, we have no default policies to begin with and essentially warn the users they have an investment of a few hours to a few days depending on their proficiency, how many of those users will then disable RSBAC?  I'm guessing at least 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with, optimistically, 10% of our users who will a) enable and b) configure RSBAC then c) use it.  Makes you wonder if it's even worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing to consider here is if, as I was told, we provide the RSBAC tool and RSBAC support in the kernel, but do not enable it out of the box and do not provide default policies, we can only consider ourselves a security technology &lt;i&gt;provider&lt;/i&gt;.  We cannot, by any means, call ourselves a security technology &lt;i&gt;solution&lt;/i&gt;.  Fedora and RH can call themselves a &lt;i&gt;solution&lt;/i&gt; because SELinux is enabled, with default policies, out of the box (although I believe you can turn SELinux support off during install).  Novell can call itself a &lt;i&gt;solution&lt;/i&gt; because AppArmor is running out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can call ourselves a &lt;i&gt;provider&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;enabler&lt;/i&gt;, nothing more.  Which looks rather sad compared to the security &lt;i&gt;solutions&lt;/i&gt; out there.  In fact, I was told that putting RSBAC into the kernel was a "value added service" (in the context of not having any default policies or "out-of-the-box"-ness to go with it).  I don't believe this is true at all.  There is no value to something that such a minority (the optimistic 10%) will use, but which we will have to maintain.  There is no value to pre-packaged rsbac-admin tools that are useless by themself.  Until I argued against it, the SELinux tools were provided in cooker with no SELinux support in the kernel.  This is like that.. we might as well say that providing the SELinux libraries and user-space tools is "value added" because the user only has to patch and recompile the kernel and not compile the userspace tools.  Unless the definition of "value added" has changed recently, this isn't it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I've got RSBAC and AppArmor running together here.  I've got the AppArmor packages Annvix-ized (which means it would take me 5 minutes to adapt them for Mandriva).  The kernel team could probably apply the AppArmor patches, in conjunction with the RSBAC patches, fairly easily.  Default AppArmor policies could be generated for most important apps in a matter of days (and by important I'm talking about servers (forward-facing apps) and networking clients, such as web browsers, email clients... things that could potentially be abused by malicious remote servers).  I suspect the AppArmor tool would take half the amount of time to write than the equivalent RSBAC tool (nevermind the other backend/supporting tools also required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it really that difficult to believe that AppArmor could be fully deployed in cooker within 2 weeks?  Whereas we'd be &lt;i&gt;lucky&lt;/i&gt; to have all the things in place for full RSBAC support within the required 2 months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I've done my part and looked into this.  I'm used to being ignored when it comes to recomendations like this.  I hope this time I'm not.  If I am, however, this will be here for posterity, and if I'm not, well, I'm hoping this could serve as a good roadmap or bitbucket on what challenges would be involved to get full RSBAC support for Corporate Server 5.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT&lt;/b&gt;:  I've been told that we're working on default policies to use with RSBAC, and not necessarily a tool to configure it.  That changes my arguments somewhat about the viability of the out-of-boxness of RSBAC come Mandriva 2007 (if this is true), but then I'm hoping someone writes some good docs so the end user knows how to use the existing CLI tools.  Now, until I can talk to Thierry (I believe he's been on holidays the last week or two), we'll never know for sure whether the plan is for policies and no tool, or a tool and no policies.  Either way, my argument stands.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>So why don't I like the 2.6 kernel anyways?</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/so-why-dont-i-like-the-26-kernel-anyways.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-06-21T00:16:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-06-21T00:16:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-06-21:/blog/so-why-dont-i-like-the-26-kernel-anyways.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of people asking me why, when it comes to my own servers, &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/"&gt;Annvix&lt;/a&gt;, and my own personal recommendations to people who ask what kernel to use, I whole-heartedly do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; recommend the 2.6 kernel and instead advocate the stability and greater security of the 2 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of people asking me why, when it comes to my own servers, &lt;a href="http://annvix.org/"&gt;Annvix&lt;/a&gt;, and my own personal recommendations to people who ask what kernel to use, I whole-heartedly do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; recommend the 2.6 kernel and instead advocate the stability and greater security of the 2.4 kernel.  Well, for kicks I downloaded a CSV file of the entire CVE database from &lt;a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cve/downloads/"&gt;MITRE's CVE downloads page&lt;/a&gt; and did some poking around to determine some metrics.  Note that the CVE database starts in 1999, so it should cover everything from the 2.4 kernel's first release until today, and, of course, the 2.6 kernel to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the results, I had to cull some of the non-linux data, so I grepped for "linux" first, then took that output file and grepped for kernel to get my final dataset to work with, and is a lot more manageable (363k vs. the 12.7MB download file).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here also is with how the CVE names are described.  For instance, it's not easy to determine, by looking at a CVE entry if something that says "SCTP in Linux kernel before 2.6.16.17 bla bla evil thing" means it affects all 2.6 kernels, or if it also affects 2.4 kernels.  I'm leaning towards the former because other entries say things like "The foo function in Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x before 2.6.16 bla bla naughty stuff", which clearly indicates both 2.6 and 2.4 are involved.  I also removed all the external references from each line in the CSV so the line simply contains the CVE name, whether it's an entry or a candidate, and the MITRE description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while these results cannot be considered scientific or probably even closely accurate, let's look at a few things.  The first is the first and last CVE names for a given kernel where their version shows up in the description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.2 - CVE-1999-0804 to CVE-2005-1263 (22 total)
2.4 - CVE-2001-0907 to CVE-2006-2071 (59 total)
2.6 - CVE-2003-0986 to CVE-2006-2629 (132 total)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above was obtained using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
egrep "kernel.*2\.6\." linux-cve.csv|wc -l
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which might not be 100% accurate given some representations are given as simply "kernel 2.6", etc so doing it again using "kernel.*2.6" and so forth gives the folloowing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.2 - 26 total
2.4 - 77 total
2.6 - 154 total&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the variance isn't actually too bad.  For a complete reference, there were 308 total CVE entries from CVE-1999-0216 to CVE-2006-2629 in the file.  Now, if you consider the fact that no mater which number you look at, the number of 2.6-related vulnerabilities is at least twice as high as that of 2.4, that 2.4 hasn't yet been retired so has been "active" for 5 years whereas the 2.6 kernel has only been for 3 years, well, you kinda get the idea of why I don't look too fondly on the 2.6 kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it has some kick-ass features (I, for one, would love to play around with AppArmor), but it also has some severe drawbacks and because I get mailings multiple times a day from MITRE with new CVE name assignments, and I see so many more 2.6-related stuff than 2.4-related stuff... well, I've got a theory and some people will dislike it, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until kernel development branches to 2.7 and the 2.6 kernel is left the hell alone, it will continue to suck, continue to have security issues introduced everytime you turn around (folks, most of these vulnerabilities are being &lt;i&gt;introduced&lt;/i&gt; during the 2.6 lifetime!  This isn't old stuff!), you find more security holes.  Frankly, I feel bad for the Mandriva kernel maintainer (sorry Luiz, you have a shit job having to deal with this).  I feel for all vendors who have to support the 2.6 kernel.  I'm quite happy that Annvix is using the 2.4 kernel and, although we plan to include 2.6 in some fashion for the next release, I promise you that the 2.6 kernel will never be the default until they stop dicking around with it and move on to 2.7 to change APIs and goof off with neat new things, and leave the 2.6 series to stabilize.  This crap about vendors picking and maintaining a 2.6 "sub-branch"(?) like 2.6.15 or 2.6.16 and going from there is crap.  If you're going to do that, you might as well move on and branch to 2.7 and leave 2.6 in 100% maintenance mode, like your happy, friendly, stable, and much less insecure 2.4 friend is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I dislike the 2.6 kernel so much.  I think the whole change of development style from 2.4 to 2.6 completely butchered the stability of the kernel, and the security.  Yup, I will probably get flamed like mad for this, but the stats don't lie (perhaps just the interrpetation of them, but I can't see how you can interpret that in a "nice" light).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I would much rather have used MITRE's search tool on their website, but the search results were coming up with 20-something results when searching for 2.4 &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; 2.6 and I know that's wrong... our last few Mandriva updates have had 20 CVE names in a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; advisory so I know that's not right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, there... now if someone asks me (again) why I don't like the 2.6 kernel, I can point them here.  And if someone feels like going through the CVE names with a little more accuracy in mind (I'm happy with generalizations) please feel free and let me know the specifics.  It's almost 1:00am here and I just don't have the time, desire, or patience to be anal... err... completely 100% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Proprietary ATI and fresh install of Mandriva 2006/x86_64</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/proprietary-ati-and-fresh-install-of-mandriva-2006x86_64.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-06-14T11:27:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-06-14T11:27:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-06-14:/blog/proprietary-ati-and-fresh-install-of-mandriva-2006x86_64.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have this shiny new HP media PC to play with (well, setup really) and I installed Mandriva 2006/x86_64 on it last night and was somewhat disappointed with how it turned out.

The big issue was with the proprietary ATI drivers which, to my amazement, weren't in commercial Club repositories.  This is a fairly significant problem because our upgraded xorg-x11 requires these new drivers (I discovered this after --auto-selecting from the updates medium and X stopped working).  This morning I find there are no new drivers in Club.  Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So wandering over to &lt;a href="https://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894&amp;task=knowledge&amp;folderID=300"&gt;ATI's download page&lt;/a&gt; found me the latest drivers in a nice installer form.  Download the ATI Driver Installer and go to town... it actually works quite well.  With it, you can create Mandriva rpms by following the little dialogs that seem to be 100% compatible (I installed the powerpack DVD so it had the old proprietary drivers and using this, the packages were made and I could just "rpm -Fvh" the resulting rpm packages).  Yes!  X works again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a heck of a time setting up my urpmi sources last night tho... looks like mDNSResponder is being stupid... ftp was complaining about no buffer space being left, but lynx worked (anything using FTP, btw... so that was the ftp client and curl).  Disabling mDNSResponder allowed me to get my urpmi sources setup.  Strange... I don't recall seeing this before but this was one of the few times I didn't really fiddle with the install and disable a bunch of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other issue is a long-standing one with 2006/x86_64 community and some broken KDE/QT packages.  This has been a problem for months, I've reported it on numerous occassions (because I've seen it on my x86_64 laptop) and it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; isn't fixed.The problem is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@media ~]# urpmi --media community --auto-select
Some package requested cannot be installed:
foomatic-db-3.0.2-1.20060227.0.1.20060mdk.noarch
Continue? (Y/n) 
The following packages have to be removed for others to be upgraded:
libarts1-1.4.2-2mdk.i586 (due to missing libqt-mt.so.3)
libkdecore4-3.4.2-31.3.20060mdk.i586 (due to missing libqt-mt.so.3, due to 
  unsatisfied libqt3 &gt;= 3.2.2, due to missing libartsflow.so.1, due to missing 
  libartsflow_idl.so.1, due to missing libkmedia2_idl.so.1, due to missing libmcop.so.1, 
  due to missing libqtmcop.so.1, due to missing libsoundserver_idl.so.1)
libqt3-3.3.4-23mdk.i586 (due to unsatisfied qt3-common == 3.3.4-23mdk)
mindawn-1.3.050824-050916mdk.i586 (due to missing libqt-mt.so.3)

x86-compat-galaxy-kde-1.0.2-19mdk.x86_64 (due to missing libkdefx.so.4) (y/N) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umm... this sucks and is a major nuisance because it gets in the way of everything else in community from getting upgraded other than urpmi and glibc.  Of course, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don't need any of this, but the fellow who's picking up this computer might (I'm sure he might like to play with skype).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is all KDE/QT-related stuff which strengthens my notion that KDE sucks.  Oh, and that x86_64 is a second-rate citizen.  Has &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; else seen this?  If I elect to remove those packages (hit "y" instead of "n"), I get a whole whack of packages to update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is a default 2006/x86_64 powerpack DVD install.  I removed a few thinks, like kdegraphics-kprintfax or whatever, stuff like kopete I removed, but for the most part I left things well enough alone and this is the thanks I get.  Bad community repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I guess he doesn't get to play with skype after all... I can't leave the machine in a half-baked state so off we go.  &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Mounting remote systems via ssh</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/mounting-remote-systems-via-ssh.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-06-09T17:50:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-06-09T17:50:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-06-09:/blog/mounting-remote-systems-via-ssh.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I write these little things called TechMails for &lt;a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/"&gt;TechRepublic&lt;/a&gt; every month and this month I was looking at Konqueror and it's fish:// Kioslave stuff.

I've never actually played with fish before, probably because I don't really like KDE and never use it but this stuff is pretty neat.  I have no idea if GNOME/Nautilus can do this too (I hope so!), but if not I know I can use stuff like sshfs which is pretty cool too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thinking about my use of OS X on the desktop, I did a half-hearted poke to see if anything like that existed for OS X.  I don't expect to see the Finder allow me to mount remote systems via sftp or anything (although it would be really cool if it did), but I can't seem to find anything that would let me do that, which is disappointing.  About the closest I can get is BBEdit's support for opening FTP/SFTP locations for file editing.  That is handy, definitely, but navigating the remote "filesystem" in BBEdit's open file dialog is less than... nice.  Not only that, but I like Konq's preview and whatnot capabilities with fish://.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's to hoping that someone at Apple, or one of the other fine developers for OS X, think about implementing a filesystem browser or something for OS X that works kinda like the fish KIOslave.  Maybe the fine folks at CocoaTech who make the excellent Path Finder app (a Finder replacement) could implement something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cool as this is, it sure won't make me use KDE day to day, especially seeing as how easy sshfs is to setup and use.  KDE's fish:// support is great as a proof-of-concept, but if it means using KDE to use it, I'll wait for another implementation.  =)  Sorry, but I can't stand KDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised tho, that more people/programs don't have support like this especially considering that ssh/sftp are so commonplace now.  I see a lot of FTP clients with this support, but no real filesystem "navigators".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, I'd even use Konqueror under GNOME if I didn't think it'd make my eyes bleed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Of vacations and surgeries</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/of-vacations-and-surgeries.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-06-03T13:55:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-06-03T13:55:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-06-03:/blog/of-vacations-and-surgeries.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've been on holidays for two weeks now, with just a little less than a week to go.

Talk about busy vacations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first week I spent a fair amount of time working on Annvix just because I don't have time otherwise to really get in there and work on it, especially the more time consuming stuff like merging in the Mandriva changes for apache and a few other big packages, so it was good to get some of that stuff done.  That kept me pretty busy for that whole first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, not so much time spent in front of the computer.  Mostly been entertaining my daughter (which is difficult and exhausting if you're not used to it!) because my wife had surgery on Monday and has been pretty much in bed sleeping or unmoving since then (just a day surgery, so she's been home, but she's only really been feeling well since Thurs).  Thank God for grandma's to help entertain the kid and give me a break (oh, and check on the wife as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully next week I'll get some more time to do more interesting things... not necessarily goof off on the computer although I did plan to do up some log monitoring scripts with swatch and socklog, and also play a bit with mod_security.  We'll see how things pan out.  My only plans are to take Jayden swimming at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

Email's been around for ages, so why are email clients still so crappy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August I switched from the OS X Mail.app (in Tiger) to mutt because Tiger's Mail.app was too stinking slow.  I get lots of mail... I mean &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of mail.  My incoming mbox for this month so far is 102MB.  The number of messages in that mbox?  8427.  That's roughly 400 messages a day.  Tiger's Mail was dying under that load (when Panther's Mail didn't... it's due to Mail now using individual files for each message rather than an mbox (thanks, Spotlight)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mutt was so nice... so fast... so nice...  like an old friend.  I looked at most of the available OS X mail clients, and all of them were lacking something.. some lacked threading support (WTF?  are you kidding me?!?), some worked only with PGP and not GnuPG, some just plain old sucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, recently due to some problems at the colo with a bad switch, mail deliveries from here have been somewhat problematic and I was getting hit by the default OS X maximum-number-of-processes-per-user issue (only 100 procs per user), which was quickly being eaten by silly little sendmail processes (using postfix here to relay the mail from the local machine through the colo, for it to deliver to the end recipient).  So, I figured... it's been a year, I'll see how some things look.
Well, the obvious first choice was Thunderbird.  The one major drawback to Thunderbird is the lack of integration with the OS X address book (and keychain).  But I was willing to look past that.  Well, having played with an imported my mail and everything into Thunderbird over the last day, I can tell you that it sucks far more than just lack of AB integration.  What an awfully slow, strange, and (quite frankly) ugly program!  Ick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've cranked up my maximum procs from 100 to 512 (softlimit) and 2048 (hardlimit).  If nothing else, those sendmail threads won't be wrecking my terminal sessions.  And it's back to mutt.  I don't even have the patience to try anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird may work great on Windows, considering it's major competition is outlook which is even worse, but on OS X it's rather awful.  And don't even start with the "Linux has better mail clients" because it doesn't... kmail is an awful program (and it inherits the rather distastful KDE look-n-feel), and Evolution while being ok, just doesn't do it for me.  Been a while, so maybe it's better, but I really don't feel like reading mail on my laptop... I'd rather use my desktop machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe next year there will be better mail clients.  I just don't get how a CLI client like mutt is so far superior to all these new/new-ish email clients that are out there.  Is it that hard to write a good GUI client that isn't slower than... well... I won't say.  Anyways, it's slow.  I'll take my fetchmail/procmail/SpamAssassin/postfix/mutt setup any day over what's currently available.  It just astounds me as to what people are willing to settle for.  I guess if you don't deal with email that much you probably don't care, but email is my connection to the world and work (can't really pick up the phone to call fcrozat to ask him something about a firefox security issue).  It has to work and it has to be a no-brainer and it has to be fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to find a good GUI client to fill that criteria.  The only GUI mail client that I've &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; really liked was PMMail/2 for OS/2... now that was a damn fine email client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you're on OS X (Tiger) and ever see a message on the console or terminal about not being able to fork and "resource temporarily unavailable", wander over to here and read this: &lt;a href="http://ruminate.net/pdm/mt/os_x_tips/os_x_tiger_104_process_limits_solution.html"&gt;http://ruminate.net/pdm/mt/os_x_tips/os_x_tiger_104_process_limits_solution.html&lt;/a&gt; .  Very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic jist of it is to use "launchctl" to determine what your limits are set to (ie. "launchctl limit") and then create a /etc/launchd.conf file that contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
limit maxproc 512 2048
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which will bump up the softlimit and hardlimit respectively to 512 and 2048.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>I feel so swordfish</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/i-feel-so-swordfish.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-05-10T12:38:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-05-10T12:38:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-05-10:/blog/i-feel-so-swordfish.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever seen that movie Swordfish with Hally Berry(sp?) and John Travolta?

I like that movie.  Appeals to me.  Hackers... security... mmm...  even if it is a little.. outlandish in parts.  Anyways, my favourite scene is when he goes to the big house and sits in front of that computer with 8 or 10 monitors attached to it... his "hack station".  Whoah.  That's my kinda machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my primary desktop machine is my dual 1.8GHz G5... nothing overly fancy in terms of the hardware itself (it's a few years old now) but it does everything I need.  It's always run two 20" LCD displays but the other day for kicks I decided to try stuffing another video card in that box.. just cuz I can and because I have some spare monitors kicking around that aren't being used.  I got the Mac edition Radeon 9200 PCI card (I suppose I could have gone for a higher-end AGP card to replace the nvidia card that's in here now but my idea was to expand, not replace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after sticking that puppy in there, hooking up another 19" and 20" LCD monitors, I'm feeling rather swordfish.  I thought dual-head was the bomb (and I've been doing that for years, starting off with two 15" CRT monitors running off old 8MB PCI cards "back in the day").  I do have to admit, however, that it worked a lot smoother than I've ever experienced with X.  Turned it on and bang, there they were.  Minor tweaks (optimal resolutions and re-placement) but that's it.  Otherwise, it works quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only downside is that Quartz Extreme doesn't run on the PCI cards (Apple disabled it for performance reasons I guess... PCI bus is too slow and I don't have the faster PCI express or whatever it's called).  So that's disappointing.  I tried this program called PCI Extreme which is supposed to enable Quartz Extreme support on the PCI card, but (although System Profiler tells me it's now enabled) it didn't do much for performance.  WoW stutters like crazy on those displays, but when I move it to my primary (original) monitors, it works great (despite the fact this nvidia AGP card is a 64MB card and the radeon is 128MB).  Oh well.  Works great for more terminals which is what I really wanted (I routinely have about a dozen or more terminals open at a time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been using this since last night and it is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; nice.  Like I said... I feel swordfish.  Need a few more to get the "full effect" but dangit... four monitors on one box is more than a reasonable person would ever use so I guess I've got my "geek on" with just this.  =)  Who the hell needs multiple machines when you can run four monitors off a single machine?  I've always envied my friend Kurt with his triple-display Windows setup... but now &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;'m the man!  Muwuhahahah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure would be nice if I could get Quartz Extreme working properly on that PCI card tho... it seems unnaturally slow for some stuff, like WoW and iPhoto.  For just plain old "text"-ish stuff (terminals, browser, etc.) it does pretty good tho.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>The problem with incentives for new clients</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/the-problem-with-incentives-for-new-clients.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-05-01T14:47:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-05-01T14:47:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-05-01:/blog/the-problem-with-incentives-for-new-clients.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like to call this entry "The problem with incentives for new clients" or, the title I really like, "Why companies screw over the companies who've supported them for years".&lt;/p&gt;

It's nice that, with more HD programming and that HD TV's are cheaper, that they're offering one year of free HD service and one year of free HD receiver rentals to new customers.  That's fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I've been with Bell for about 5 years now... faithful customer, never late, never getting a pirate card to rip them off... I've been a stellar customer.  So when I phoned them to ask what I, as a loyal customer could get if I upgraded to their HD service, I was politely told they could "probably" swing 3 months of free programming for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pardon?  You "probably" can give me the equivalent of $30?  So, the new guy can get the $10/mo of HD programming waived for a year and the (I think) $15/mo rental fee waived, working out to $300 (and probably with free installation) whereas I have to buy the second arm to upgrade my satellite, string more cable into the house to handle the HD signal, and pay $270 in rental fees for a year on top of that initial cost and effort, just for the pleasure of having been a good customer for 5 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one who thinks this is retarded?  If it wasn't for the time-shifting feature, which my wife claims she can't live without, I'd be getting SHAW's digital TV with the HD support and it would cost me &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; to switch than it does for me to continue being a good customer with a company I've been with for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman who offered me the $30 in waived fees should have just kicked me in the... you know.

I've been lightly reading (and laughing about) a thread on the exim mailing list entitled "Why is this list so abusive?" because some people are getting answers like RTFM.  Now, granted, exim can be a fairly daunting MTA.. it's configurable up the whazoo and the documentation is hefty.  But the documentation is, unlike many other programs, stellar.  You won't find more comprehensive and well-written documentation than the exim manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone pointed out the following "paper" from Eric Raymond: &lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"&gt;How to ask questions the smart way&lt;/a&gt;.  I think everyone who posts on any OSS mailing list should read this.  Some of it is amusing, and some of it is downright logical.  I also think that everyone posting on an OSS mailing list needs to grow some thicker skin because, inevitably, you're going to catch people who are busy, people who are grumpy and, yes, people who are egomaniacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, first and foremost, remember that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are asking people for help.  You're not paying for support, you're not entitled to support because you're using someone's free software, and you certainly can't demand it.  If someone doesn't feel like helping you, don't feel bad... just think about how many times someone has asked for help of you and you never gave it or think of the people asking for help on lists that you're on and you just couldn't be bothered to take the time.  People on these mailing lists have lives and families too and, believe it or not, there is some rationale in wanting to spend time &lt;i&gt;coding&lt;/i&gt; the software in question than just fielding questions regarding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and yes, RTFM before you ask questions because doing otherwise makes you look stupid and lazy.  Sorry, but it's true.  Sometimes the old addage can be adapted.  Instead of "God helps those who help themselves" we should maybe say that "Geeks help those who help themselves".

Everyone wants to leave a legacy... in the most basic form it's being a parent to a child who will carry on a physical legacy.  Almost everyone has a legacy, will have a legacy, or is someone else's legacy.  There are, of course, other folks with bigger legacies... the guy who found Canada (no idea who he was, but I'm sure someone in Canada remembers him (or her)), the guy who found electricity (don't know his name either... I'm pretty bad with history).. the first guy on the moon, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, tonight I was reminded of one of my legacies, and one I don't think much of.  I've had a computer since I was a kid... my first machine as an IBM PS/2... a whopping 16MHz, 80MB drive... yeah, some of you old timers had to deal with punch cards but you can't steal the fact that I started off on a pretty tiny machine too (considering my daughter's first machine was an iBook G3, I had it pretty rough).  Well, I got my first modem, got on my first BBS, and was hooked.  Within 6mos I had my own BBS.  Ask my wife sometime how much grief my BBSing gave her when we started dating (I'm sure her loathing of computers originated there... no, the loathing is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the legacy I'm talking about here, but it is one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, back in 1996 I started a fidonet-style network called Sysop's TechNet.  The point of the network was to discuss BBS'ing, to facilitate the expansion of new technologies being used in BBSing with the internet becoming more widely available and accessible, and the sticks in FidoNet were doing nothing but arguing.  Actually, quite a few good ideas came out of STN and I think some of the proposals and work we had done is still being used today, like the reconstruction of the nodelist to accomodate internet/telnet boards.  Anyways, I shut my board down in 2000 when I started working for (then) Mandrake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine my shock to realize that, even today, STN is still alive.  Maybe not thriving like it was in the old days (but no BBS is, either), but it's still alive, still moderately active, and still very much alive.  Something I started almost 10 years ago still has &lt;a href="http://www.sysoptech.net/stn-info.html"&gt;my name&lt;/a&gt; attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this gets a guy thinking.  I logged into my first BBS today in probably 4 years.  And it felt good.  =)  I didn't have any privileges to do much, but dangit... I was on a BBS.  It was old-school.  It felt damn good to be sitting there looking at ANSI art in all it's hideous blocky glory.  I remember the old groups...  iCE, ACiD, and the others... man, those guys were amazing!  The things they could do with colored blocks (digital lego?) was insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now this has me thinking.  And, unfortunately for me (once my wife finds out anyways), I'm actually thinking about setting up a BBS again.  Unlike my old friend Kevin who sparked this with an email today, I'm not gonna setup an OS/2 box to run the old software.  When I shut down my board, I was running &lt;a href="http://www.bbbs.net/"&gt;BBBS&lt;/a&gt; which is perhaps the best BBS software out there and runs on DOS, OS/2, Windows, Linux (intel, SPARC, and alpha), and even FreeBSD.  For kicks a few months ago I dusted off my old backup CD and threw it on a Mandriva box to see if it still worked.  It did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I'm looking at this backup CD again and am seriously contemplating building this thing up from scratch again.  I did email the author of BBBS a few months ago to see if he'd release the source to BBBS... unfortunately, he said no.  Too bad.  I tried to encourage him to compile it for OS X... considering I haven't heard from him, I suspect he hasn't but maybe if I start running this sucker again he might.  I don't need a cocoa interface for it... but I'd love to have BTERM (a special telnet/terminal emulator to connect to BBBS which has better enhancements than a traditional terminal program (or telnet)) run on OS X.  Then I wouldn't have to ssh into a Linux box to use it (and there's squat for good terminal programs for OS X, unfortunately, although I did manage to make xterm behave well enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't just carry on from where I left off... back then I was using Mandrake 6.0 (or so), had a SCSI CD-ROM, a bunch of files available for download through the CD system since I didn't have the space to store all the CDs, and a bunch of networks that may not even exist anymore.  Best thing to do would be to start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amusingly enough, I can still see my work on BBBS still lives on.  If you look at the &lt;a href="http://www.bbbs.net/sysop.html#ABOUT_MANUAL"&gt;About this manual&lt;/a&gt; section of the BBBS docs, you'll see that, once again, I'm involved.  In fact, I wrote docs for a number of software including Nexus (another BBS package), and McMail (a frontend mailer).  I also beta tested &lt;i&gt;tonnes&lt;/i&gt; of different software including BBBS, AllFix, WaterGate, McMail, Oblivion/2, T-Mail, Internet Rex... I know there's more but those are the ones I can remember off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I get back into BBSing to the same extent?  Obviously not.  Things have changed, Mandriva keeps me busy, and "recreation" such as World of Warcraft, Annvix, Oblivion on XBOX360, and last, but totally not least, my wife and kid, make time spent on a BBS probably quite minimal.  But I feel like a guy who played with trains as a kid and then grows up and builds model trains as a hobby.  The nice thing about this hobby is it's completely free now.  My BBBS license is paid.  My internet access is already paid.  I don't have to pay long distance, I don't have to get additional phone lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, really, I don't even care if anyone ever connects to it.  It'd be cool if some folks from back in the day did drop in to say hi, but I can live with being a sole user.  If nothing else, it gives me an outlet that is different from working on Linux, or doing PHP coding, or even playing games.  It'll bring me back to my teenage years.  If nothing else, it'll amuse me.  And the scripting language for BBBS (BZ) is awesome... it'll be interesting to re-learn that stuff again.  Heck... I might even find some of my old BZ programs floating around.  =)  And maybe I'll compile openrexx or whatever the OSS implementation of REXX is since BBBS can run REXX scripts too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah... the more I think about it, the more I think I'll do it.  If it takes me a month to get it setup, who cares?  The fun will be in the journey, not the destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia can be a pretty powerful thing, no?  If it wasn't for nostalgia, I'd probably never do this.  But &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; made me hold onto that CD for the last 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Blog spam</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/blog-spam.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-04-22T18:11:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-04-22T18:11:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-04-22:/blog/blog-spam.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good God...

One of the things I hate doing is Windows maintenance and it seems like there is a lot of that going around.  Inevitably it's the same symptoms leading to the cause...  expired Norton Antivirus protection, lack of a hardware firewall, and the reliance on software like Ad-Aware (which, BTW, I've never used or heard of up until this past Sunday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have a friend's machine here, for which I'm charging to repair, of course, that's doing all kinds of funky things.  I get some kind of sadistic pleasure in re-formatting these drives... but that's dampened by the fact that I have to backup data and figure out a way to get it all back clean.  That already proved an issue with Windows file-locking and the inability to copy files that are in use (how silly is that?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well.. for all you poor Windows suckers out there, may I offer a few words of advice?  A Linksys firewall/router is really cheap... and offers way more protection than some software-based firewall (on Windows, of course).  Buy one.  Please.  Also, if you need a virus scanner, don't let Norton or McAffee gouge you with inferior products... use &lt;a href="http://www.clamwin.net/"&gt;ClamWin&lt;/a&gt; which is a port of ClamAV for Windows.  Not only is it free, but it works.  For spyware, the only recommendation I have is get another OS.  I've never looked at any of those solutions but if Ad-Aware is one of the "best" in that category, my brothers who are slaves to the Windows beast are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and use Firefox and Thunderbird instead of Internet Explorer and Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm off to try to get some of this data back onto his machine and hopefully not lose any of it due to viruses or other malware (am I off my rocker or does ClamWin just report/delete/quarantine files?  I thought virus scanners could clean files too or have they just given up on this?)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Parallels virtualization on OS X</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/parallels-virtualization-on-os-x.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-04-06T15:43:00-06:00</published><updated>2006-04-06T15:43:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-04-06:/blog/parallels-virtualization-on-os-x.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, like pretty much everyone, I was pretty pleased to see &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/"&gt;BootCamp&lt;/a&gt; released by Apple; a tool that allows one to dual-boot an intel mac.

Not good enough for me, but a good first step.  I've been waiting for VMWare to step up to the plate and offer a Mac version of their workstation product so I can run Linux, Windows, etc. on a mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait!  Today a beta of &lt;a href="http://www.parallels.com/"&gt;Parallels&lt;/a&gt; is available for OS X.    Now, I've never heard of these guys before.  I've used a lot of different desktop virtualization software: VMWare, VirtualPC (which stunk), and Qemu (I've tried the Q frontend on OS X and it's ok).  So this thing has a beta you can download and trial.  Currently, I'm installing Windows 2000 in it (my XP disk is an upgrade disk and I can't seem to swap real CDs during install).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tip...  you can use an ISO image for the CD (like you can in VMWare), but I couldn't make it see a real CD-ROM/DVD-ROM device.  Tried pointing it to the mountpoint, etc. and nothing.  I did finally figure out that you can stick in your install CD, let it mount, then pop to the terminal and type "mount" to see what you've got mounted.  In my case I saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
/dev/disk1s0 on /Volumes/W2PFPP_EN
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to unmount this in disk utility or anything, the CD will get ejected so you need to do "sudo umount /Volumes/W2PFPP_EN" (or whatever it is) to unmount it but leave the CD in the drive.  Then you can tell Parallels to use "/dev/disk1s0" (or whatever the partition device is) and it'll work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Parallels locks the device so you can't eject it so for me, to get XP in there, I need to install 2000 first (because my disk is an upgrade disk).  Kinda sucks, but whatever.  If the upgrade from 2000 to XP craps out, I'll just 2000 in there (doesn't matter what I use, I just want Win[something] in there for Quicken and QuickBooks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be able to tell soon how this thing stacks up to VMWare.  The price is about $50.00 compared to (I believe) VMWare's $99, but if VMWare came out with a beta for OS X today, I'd drop Parallels in a heart-beat.  I've been using VMWare since 2.0 and love it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Annvix blog</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/annvix-blog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-03-30T10:51:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-03-30T10:51:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-03-30:/blog/annvix-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I moved all the Annvix-related blog entries to the new &lt;a href="http://blog.annvix.org/"&gt;Annvix Developer's Blog&lt;/a&gt; since I'm "consolidating" all Annvix-related stuff there.

So, since then I've been putting info on security updates we work on into a FileMaker database (yeah yeah, I know... the zealots out there will crucify me for using commercial software but... it works and saves me tonnes of time... find me something as good on Linux and I'll look at it (FM works on OS X and Windows only, more's the shame)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I just finished inputting the last bit of data from last year's advisories which was a manual process because the data I wanted to put into the database wasn't all in one place, or even could be consistently retrieved.. I'm sure I could write a script to do it, but it probably would have taken twice as long.  But some interesting stuff has come out of this little database now that I can look at certain trends.  I'll have to make some reports and such to really do some more interesting things with the info, but from a flat "here's a list ordered by MDKSA/MDKA id" I can see certain things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, we're almost spot on where we were last year in terms of advisories.  Last year at this time we had reached MDKSA-2005:061 and last week we put up MDKSA-2006:060 (now, this doesn't take into account non-security MDKA advisories or "-1" advisories).  I actually thought we were busier this year than last, and I think we were, but things have been not quite as hectic the last 2-3 weeks (which is wierd... I'm waiting for something like zlib to nail us again); if the trend had continue we were on, we would have put out MDKSA-2006:075 (or higher) last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also interesting to see how quick the turn-around is from when we start working on an advisory to when we have it out.  There are, obviously, some exceptions to the rule based on external circumstances such as agreed-upon embargos for non-public advisories, work being done by another team (ie. Fred Crozat (God bless him) typically does all our Mozilla updates and the kernel team does the kernel updates), etc.  Sometimes we've begun working on something, tested it, etc. only to find through peer review that a patch is insufficient or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it looks like the average time to handle an update from start to finish is 3-4 days, which I don't think is bad at all considering the "multiples" we have to deal with; ie. one advisory in, say, apache, might affect all platforms for which we may be actively supporting 5 different distributions on two different architectures meaning there are 10 different tests that need to be performed.  This also includes the time to build and patch updates (but doesn't include research time as this info is based on when we actually start &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; an update).  Our longest update was 79 days which, when I look at it now, is absolutely astounding.  Of course, this was from the old kernel maintainer (and it was for the kernel) and our process in place now is much much better.  In fact, I believe that update could very well have been one of the contributing factors to his being.... dismissed.  Kernels definitely don't take that long anymore.  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other interesting data (and I only went back to incorporate all of 2005 in this database... no way I'm going back further):  there are 398 records in the database, so 398 updates since Jan 1, 2005, or in the last 15 months.  That works out to being 26.5 updates/month, or 1.325 updates/day (assuming on average 20 working days in a month).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually extremely impressed by that.  I didn't realize Stew and I worked that hard.  =)  I may have more interesting statistics available in the future... now that I have the data in the database I can actually work with it and make it do something useful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Subversion, MediaWiki, and Bugzilla</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/subversion-mediawiki-and-bugzilla.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-03-25T01:30:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-03-25T01:30:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-03-25:/blog/subversion-mediawiki-and-bugzilla.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Found this fantastic article about &lt;a href="http://oss.segetech.com/bugzilla-svn-wiki.html"&gt;how to setup Subversion, MediaWiki, and Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt; to be nicely integrated.

I've shovelled snow &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; times today.  Heck, almost half my day has been spent shovelling snow.  My back can't take anymore of this... that last one almost laid me flat.  Good thing my wife is in excellent shape... she's been out three times already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year we had something similar, but in April.  Massive snow dump.  I ended up manually shovelling my in-law's driveway to their house on an acreage...  couldn't find keys to the snowblower and the jetta was stuck half-way down the driveway... no choice but to shovel my way out.  That one damn near killed me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, took a few pictures and posted them on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wulfheart"&gt;flickr account&lt;/a&gt;.  Here's a good one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the other pictures, there's one of a table in my backyard.  There was &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; snow on that table when I went to bed last night.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Migration complete...

I think unplugging the usb keyboard did something (the only explanation I can come up with).  Stupid, because when I got back I connected and disconnected it a few times and nothing significant happened, but when I got there the machine was on but I had a completely blank screen.  No idea what was happening, couldn't ping, ssh, etc.  Anyways, rebooted, did some checking, couldn't find anything in the logs so put everything back, watched a bit (via ssh on the other box, I booted without the usb keyboard this time) and then phoned the wife to check on it &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; having put everything back, locked the closet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story... put everything the way you intend to leave it &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; phoning the wife.  Probably would have saved me a trip.  Anyways, seems to have gone pretty good.  A few little things I forgot and a few stupid things I did (FYI, mailman does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; do well when on a partition mounted noexec!).  I think I've got it all now tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll do some benchmarking to see how much of an improvement it is, but I don't think it's going to be crazy significant... the other machine was an Athlon64 3200+ with 512MB RAM.  The HDD bandwidth is better (SATA vs. PATA and I believe the drives are faster too and definitely have a bigger cache).  The big bonus was the form-factor and the removable drives, but I expect performance to be up a bit too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>SunFire x2100</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/sunfire-x2100.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-03-08T21:07:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-03-08T21:07:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-03-08:/blog/sunfire-x2100.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a sweet little machine...  1U opteron 146 (2GHz).

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to putting this puppy up next week.  This is going to replace my server at the colo (handles linsec.ca, annvix.org, vmlinuz.ca, etc.) and I think it'll be a pretty decent upgrade.

Yeah, the tools were ok and nothing much different from what I use except for some of the desktop-ish stuff he uses.  What got me though was the first &lt;a href="http://www.linux.com/comments.pl?sid=36338&amp;cid=87337"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; that was made.  Vim has text folding?  I had no idea.  That totally rocks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I appreciate about the two IDE's I use (Komodo and Zend Studio, although Komodo does this one thing nicer) is code folding.  I love being able to fold code and get it out of the way.  The fact that I can do this in vim, with &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; is really really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick step by step here to get the basics (use ":help folding" to get a really large rundown on all the stuff you can do):  Use "V" to visually highlight the lines you want to fold (this is in command mode, BTW) then use "zf" to fold them into one line (the "z*" commands seem to be relevant just for folding).  You'll get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
+----  8 lines: if ( $wgCommandLineMode ) {--------
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use "zo" to open the fold, which just expands it.  You can then use "zc" to close the fold again (good for quick peeks), without having to re-highlight the block.  As well, just about anything you do on the line that is the fold marker (as shown above) will expand it... ie. hitting "$" to get to the end of the line will do it, hitting the right arrow will do it, etc.  The nice thing is you can "zc" the fold while you're anywhere in the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really need to use vim more and remember all the bloody commands.  I've been using joe for so long that, although I can use vim quite well, I don't have it customized enough and can never remember simple commands like page-up/down, etc.  Maybe I should remove joe from everything and force myself to use vim (I did that with OS/2 when I first started learning Linux and look at me now!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, another article that I haven't read fully yet but that looks good is &lt;a href="http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html"&gt;Seven habits of effective text editing&lt;/a&gt; written by the vim author, Bram Moolenaar, himself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>"Security wars"?</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/security-wars.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-02-24T14:10:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-02-24T14:10:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-02-24:/blog/security-wars.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just read an amusing article on Government Computer News entitled &lt;a href="http://www.gcn.com/vol1_no1/daily-updates/38330-1.html"&gt;Security wars: Novell SELinux killer rattles Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;.

I find it amusing because now that Novell owns AppArmor, and has made it public (GPL), it's starting to rattle some SELinux-based cages (for those not in the know, Novell aquired AppArmor when it bought Immunix who originally developed it).  For that reason alone I like the idea of AppArmor... I have very high respect for the Immunix guys and the work they've done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find amusing is Red Hat's response to the release and GPL of AppArmor; from the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“In my opinion, Novell wants to split the market,” said Dan Walsh, the principal software engineer of Red Hat Inc. of Raleigh, N.C. Both Red Hat and Novell offer enterprise class Linux distributions. “Rather than working with the open-source community [on SELinux], Novell has thrown out its own competing version.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh?  Are you trying to tell me that SELinux was the only MAC software for Linux?  Maybe you're trying to tell me it's the best.  In my opinion, neither is true.To understand my point of view, you need to understand that I don't like LSM (the Linux Security Modules) which is what stuff like AppArmor and SELinux take advantage of (and for this reason, I'm not too hugely keen on AppArmor either).  To explain why, just read this from the RSBAC site on &lt;a href="http://www.rsbac.org/documentation/why_rsbac_does_not_use_lsm"&gt;Why RSBAC does not use LSM&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm inclined to agree with a lot of their points.  From the day LSM was born I was leary of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, what Red Hat (and journalists, apparently) seem to miss is that there are a lot more MAC-ish software out there, including RSBAC, GRsecurity, LIDS, and others (I think LIDS is still around... the last time I played with it was around the Mandrake 8.1 days and I loved running it, but it was too much for me to maintain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they also don't get is that while SELinux is difficult to configure, it's also way too intrusive.  The kernel stuff might be fairly simplistic due to LSM, but it has to go out and touch user-land apps too.  MAC protection is great, but when I have to have specific patches in PAM, util-linux, etc. in order to make it work in the first place, all of a sudden I've lost my interest.  I shouldn't have to patch userland tools to run this stuff.  With RSBAC, you don't have to.  I'm pretty sure with AppArmor you don't either.  That's another reason I dislike SELinux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELinux isn't the be-all and end-all and while it might be great for military setups, the end-user shouldn't have to deal with the headache.  I've read some of the implementation notes of AppArmor and find it much more suitable for the average joe than SELinux and, frankly, I'm glad Novell is going that route.  Maybe it'll make the SELinux guys look at making it a little easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you have other idiots that completely don't understand things.  Dan Walsh seems to think that Linux is going to fragment over this and we'll have another &lt;a href="http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/2006/02/09/"&gt;UNIX wars&lt;/a&gt; over this.  Folks, SELinux wasn't the first MAC implementation, and it's probably not the best either.  Remember, choice is good and alternatives rock.  Did you dis Firefox when it came out, thinking it was the browser wars all over again?  And if it was, so what?  Maybe all the attention Firefox is getting will make IE7 better (I doubt it, but hey, you never know).  If the Mozilla folks decided that they didn't want to step on any toes, Firefox would have gone nowhere.  We wouldn't have Seamonkey now.  Maybe we shouldn't have supported the creation of the Evolution email client because it might have competed unfairly with Mozilla Mail?  Maybe the guys who developed Ruby should have sat back and decided to work on Python, PHP, or Perl in order to not fragment the scripting/development communities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is good.  New, competing software is good.  It weeds out the crap.  Maybe Novell disagreed with how SELinux worked and saw changing it to suit their vision as too much work or too much of an uphill battle, fighting with SELinux authors and maintainers.  Maybe they'll looked at Immunix's stuff and went "hey, that's what we like".  Remember, AppArmor wasn't recently developed; it came along with the Immunix staff and their other technology.  So this isn't a "new" thing.  They've just made it more publically available, they've given us choice.  It's not proprietary, it's not a lock-in (anyone who can recompile a kernel can use it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the other thing I find amusing is that Dan Walsh, who is bemoaning AppArmor and berating Novell for not contributing money and effort to SELinux is working on it himself: &lt;i&gt;"Three years ago, I was asked to work on the SELinux Team at Red Hat to bring Mandatory Access Control to a mainstream operating system (OS)."&lt;/i&gt;  This isn't a neutral third-party.  Think about that.  Of course Red Hat is going to complain about AppArmor; they have a financial stake in SELinux after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I'd rather avoid both altogether, just because I don't like LSM.  Give me RSBAC any day.  It's just as hard as SELinux, has all the stuff in it you want, been around forever, and doesn't use LSM.  The SELinux junkies should love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same arguments folks make about AppArmor over SELinux could easily be made about SELinux over RSBAC.  End goals and implementation designs are the mitigating factors here and apparently Novell prefers the simplicty of AppArmor over SELinux.  For a guy who's briefly played with SELinux, I don't blame them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, because Mandriva is using the 2.6 kernel, we may want to look at AppArmor as opposed to RSBAC.  For Annvix, I'm sticking with RSBAC because I can use it on both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels (which is important since Annvix still uses a 2.4 kernel).  Since Mandriva 2006, we've not had a 2.4 kernel even as a supported alternative, so we can pretty much use whatever we like (although, from a selfish standpoint, I'd rather Mandriva uses RSBAC too).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Palm Treo 650</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/palm-treo-650.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-02-23T18:27:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-02-23T18:27:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-02-23:/blog/palm-treo-650.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week when I had my little hard drive fiasco, and about 15 minutes after writing my blog entry, I realized I had lost my phone... a motorola v710.

Figuring that it was either at the colo or at the one convenience store I had stopped at on my home, I went out at 1:30am to look for it.  Couldn't find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need my phone... =)  And since I'm already on a contract, I'd be buying a new phone outright.  I like the v710, but it doesn't sync worth crap with my mac.  I can get my calendars from iCal via bluetooth, but no contacts which seems pretty lame.  So my choice became another v710 with the data kit ($399 for the phone and about $50 for the kit), the new motorola RAZR (nice looking phone but after googling has the same problems with syncing that the v710 does (dang Telus for gutting the bluetooth support!!), or getting a Palm Treo which I know will sync because, well, my Tungsten does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the Treo was $449, or about $100 more than the v710, I figured I'd go with it.  I'm so glad I did.  I love this thing!  My Tungsten is nice, but it's old and slow... the Treo is nice and fast.  And I like the fact that I can stick dang near anything on there, and that I don't need to carry around both a phone and a palm.  I've also discovered that &lt;a href="http://www.popcap.com/launchpage.php?theGame=bejeweled2_mac&amp;src=big8"&gt;Bejeweled 2&lt;/a&gt; runs on the palm.. I registered it within hours.  The first Bejeweled was good (I believe you can play it online too), but Bejeweled 2 smokes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the Treo is great.  I'm loving this thing.  I spend too much time playing Bejeweled (perhaps part of the reason I'm not writing here much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the afternoon I bought and activated the Treo, my v710 turned up.  It was in the colo.  I thought I had dropped it at the store and I'd never see it again.

&lt;p&gt;You have no idea how blessed I am.  It's amazing how.... can't say lucky because I don't believe in luck, but it's an apt word since I've used "blessed" already and hate repeating myself... anyways... It's amazing how lucky we've been with this whole incident.  Initially my wife got a ticket because the cops said she was driving too fast for the road conditions (although we know she wasn't).  About two weeks ago we got a letter saying the charges were dismissed (she was going to go to court to fight it) so we didn't have to pay the ticket (about $170), and our insurance didn't go up (in Alberta here, we have this thing called fault insurance... long to explain but suffice it to say, insurance premiums going up is based on whether or not you were at fault).  Well, our insurance was set to renew this month (tomorrow actually) and on notification of our new premiums, they never changed.  So we're not paying extra due to the accident (blessing #2).  Then I get the car today and am told I don't have to pay the deductable ($500); the insurance company said we didn't have to pay it (blessing #3).  Lucky for us, we got a loaner car from the body shop for 2 months so no car rental fees (blessing #4).  Finally, thank God for insurance because the repairs for this car with less than 2400km on it was almost $14,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did this experience cost me?  A helluvalot of patience and a little bit of stress, but as far as money goes... not a dime.  I can honestly say that I feel "blessed and highly favoured".  Amen!&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday I started getting notifications of a smart failure on one of the drives (I have two configured as a RAID1 across a few partitions).  So I went down to the colo to swap the drive (after finding a spare here and testing the heck out of it first).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, wouldn't you know but the drive I pulled, while having some issues (they weren't overly severe, just being unable to read some blocks), wasn't the one with the real problems.  After replacing the drive and getting the first three partitions sync'd up (the smallest) I came back home expecting to login, check the status of the final sync, and carry on with my night.  Well, get home and I can ping the machine but it's not serving any data.  Drive back to the colo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the other drive is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dying.  Good thing I brought everything from the first trip back (my tools, etc.) so I could put the drive I had just pulled out back in and take the other one out.  Fortunately, the data problems weren't across the first threee (system) partitions (/boot, /, and /usr/local), but the partition containing all my web/mail files didn't finish syncing due to all the problems.  So after booting up with the original drive (and my new drive), I didn't have a /dev/md3 because it failed utterly the last few times.  Had to re-assemble that array from the original drive, then hot-add the new drive to it, to get the data back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my 20 minute job ended up taking about 5 hours to figure out.  &lt;sigh&gt;  But wouldn't you know it, when I got back home just now, I did an rsync across from my other server (which does a daily rsync) and the changed files were what I expected.  I didn't lose a single file.  I'm amazed; I thought for sure I would have lost nearly a day's worth of mail archives and stuff (everything else is fairly static with the exception of the SQL database which lives on the / partition which synced up ok).Moral of the story: RAID1 redudancy &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;.  I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the TODO is to have rsync run every four hours, rather than once a day so at the absolute most, all I can lose is 4hrs worth of stuff (this goes for the dumped and sync'd SQL databases as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other TODO (already scheduled for this summer) is to replace the machines I have at the colo with two &lt;a href="http://ca.sun.com/en/catalog/?n-state=http://catalog.sun.com/productinfo.xml?site%3dCANENCA%26catalogue%3dFC%26segment%3dFC_R%26item%3dFC_SC_CAT%26group%3d2010%26fid%3d5118%26id%3d13158%26partnerid%3dcacanen~~~G!01AC4B5F334B!WBPkexcnEpBE33lF~standard~ws-nocache"&gt;Sun x2100 servers&lt;/a&gt;... these little 1U baddies are &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; (and, BTW, Annvix runs peachy on them).  Opteron CPUs, dual gigabit nics (both fully supported), SATA support for two drives (with front-accessible trays no less!)...  I am so getting two of these.  Not only will they nicely replace 6U of servers with just 2U but &lt;b&gt;front-loading trays!&lt;/b&gt;  I won't have to take the machines out of the rack for anything less serious than a motherboard failure.  Sweet machines and reasonably priced too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad they don't have space for a third drive tho... it would be nice to set one drive aside as a spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick notes for those interested in the implementation (and how easy it was to do this, aside from the really dying drive not reporting SMART information to smartd (bad drive!)):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Login and set the partitions of the dying drive to faulty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# mdadm --manage --set-faulty /dev/md0 /dev/hda1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and repeat for all partitions on /dev/hda with all your /dev/mdX devices; in my case I had four: /dev/md[0123])&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, hot-remove the faulty devices from the RAID arrays (need to be marked as faulty first):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# mdadm /dev/md0 -r /dev/hda1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and repeat for all partitions.  Next, bring the machine down (after doing a "cat /proc/mdstat" to make sure they're really down; the arrays will be marked as running in degraded mode with a status of [U_]).  Swap out the drive.  Boot the machine again.  It's really a good idea here to make sure you can boot off of &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; drive (I do this with GRUB and set it up on both drives because here /dev/md0 is /boot, so it's accessible on both machines (as, ie. /dev/hda1 and /dev/hdc1) and then GRUB can boot from either.  This is one reason I much prefer GRUB to lilo as with GRUB I can do this, with LILO I couldn't (maybe you can now, I don't know... I haven't touched LILO in about 2 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, once you're back up and running, re-partition the new drive to match the old drive (making sure the partition types are set to fd for the RAIDed partitions).  Then hot-add them back to the array:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/hda1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What /proc/mdstat or you can use "mdadm --detail /dev/md0" to view progress and other neat info.  The arrays will reconstruct themselves and, unless you have an issue like me, you're good to go.  So, realistically, you're running three mdadm commands with a little hardware swapping in between.  I don't think a 20 minute estimate for downtime was too unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, everything is back up without a problem (knock on wood) so that's nice.  I tell ya tho... front-loading drive trays would have been fantastic.  Serial ATA would have been fantastic too.  Luckily, those servers will only be there for a few more months than they can retire back here and replace an aging LAN server (with some new drives, of course) and maintaining these remote servers should be much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Level 40... finally</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/level-40-finally.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-02-07T08:51:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-02-07T08:51:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-02-07:/blog/level-40-finally.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I've been playing WoW for a while now... since the summer of last year.

Their latest piece of editorial or user-submitted idiocy is entitled &lt;a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=13568"&gt;UNIX Security - Don't Believe the Truth&lt;/a&gt; where the idiot author is claiming that Linux/OS X security is fantastic because a virus or malware while, being unable to break the entire system, can wipe out the user's home directory and then continues on indicating that the average home user doesn't care about system files but about pictures of little Billy at Christmas with his finger up his nose, which is what makes Linux/OS X &lt;i&gt;just as&lt;/i&gt; secure as Windows and delivers a false sense of security.  Huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the author says, a backup would take care of this but because everyone feels that Linux/OS X is so secure, why do they need a backup?  I quote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Of course, they should make backups-- but wasn't Linux supposed to be secure? So why should they backup? Isn't Linux immune to viruses and what not? Isn't that what the Linux world has been telling them?&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm... excuse me?  Ever heard of a hard drive failure?  Ever heard of your wife deleting your porn collection?  Ever hear of the three year old monkeying around and deleting something by accident?  Backups don't belong to windows in the same vein that anti-virus, anti-spyware, and other malware detection/removal programs do.  Backups existed long before Windows.  Why?  Because, yes, data is important and yes, people accidentally "rm -rf" stuff (I've done it many times).  It's not because we think we need a backup because we're gonna get nailed with some malware.  Apparently this... person... thinks that backups are the sole province of Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiots of the world unite!  It's people like this, who have their constant and irritating Windows vs. Linux crud that really get under my skin because it's essentially a case of the blind leading the blind or the idiots leading the stupid.  OSNews, a site that has never received an ounce of respect from me, really has issues when they let this kind of crud go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the readers seem to have issues too because they all argue the wrong thing (the lack of malware on Linux and OS X) when they should be arguing the fact that only an idiot (yes, that is my favourite word today) would run a computer, pretend to have files that are important to them, and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have a backup of some sort of that data.  Almost every computer now-a-days comes with a CD-RW and/or a DVD+-RW.

Very slick!  Now I can rectify a stupid mistake I made on my Mandriva x86_64 build machine (had 2x250GB drives in there but made them a RAID1 set... now I have 20GB free and all I can think of is how much nicer it would be to have 500GB to store stuff I can either re-download or re-copy from the install CDs/DVDs (it's my repository for every file we've ever put into a distro, and tracking cooker, across two platforms for all currently supported distros, including cooker)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now the big rsync from one machine to the other begins, then I can make an LVM set of the two 250GBs, and then rsync everything back.  Lots of work, but at least I won't have to worry about running out of space anytime soon, and it's especially important with Corp4 coming soon, as well as 2007 (and even though 10.0 will be EOL, I need to keep the packages for help with Corp3, and even though Corp2.1 will be EOL, it takes up very little space so that doesn't save me much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunno why I never played with LVM before... looks like it could be pretty useful if you did LVM over RAID (I'm already thinking of 4x250GB or 6x250GB drives with an LVM over RAID giving me a single 750GB RAID1 partition which would make a kick-ass fileserver).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Windows innovations and the idiots that believe it</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/windows-innovations-and-the-idiots-that-believe-it.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-01-10T16:34:00-07:00</published><updated>2006-01-10T16:34:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2006-01-10:/blog/windows-innovations-and-the-idiots-that-believe-it.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find the computer industry, as pertaining to Microsoft "innovation" quite laughable.

&lt;p&gt;The next big thing?  Like what?  Let's take a quick look at Vista and what it has to offer.  Pretty much everything the OS X users have had since Tiger, if not Panther.  But this video a friend sent me speaks louder than what I could say about it:&lt;/p&gt;

Not only has this topic been beaten to death, stomped on, kicked, buried, dug up, and beaten some more, all of these so-called "experts" and journalists are nothing more than hyping a topic that, quite frankly, is more than boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, these idiots half the time don't even know what they're talking about.  For instance, look at CERT's latest report (which is a load of bung as far as I'm concerned).  The "Cyber Security Bulletin" for 2005 is retarded.  If you haven't seen it yet, you can look at it at &lt;a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/bulletins/SB2005.html"&gt;http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/bulletins/SB2005.html&lt;/a&gt;.  The basic summary is that there were 5198 reported vulns, 812 of which are Windows and 2238 which are Unix/Linux, and another 2058 multiple-OS vulns.  Well, just the summary has issues.  I mean, why does Windows (one OS) get compared against "Unix/Linux" (multiple OS's)?  For instance, I recall some vendor-specific things... like SUSE's YaST had some issues and Gentoo's portage had a few issues as well.  Those all get lumped in together, counting as (in the general totals) one OS.  Then you get stuff from SCO that everyone else fixed in 2004 that they decided to get around to (come on guys... either do it or not but your lame attempt to show you care about security is fooling no one but you), stuff specific to Apple (a vuln in coreaudio on OS X would have nothing to do with any Linux or BSD, etc.).  So now we're comparing really inflated numbers on one hand to, perhaps, moderately inflated numbers on another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20051231142317870"&gt;Groklaw&lt;/a&gt; has taken a short stab at this as well, so I won't go into too many details, suffice it to say that these reports are nothing more than senseless garbage.  They're not coherent, they're not well formulated, and they're just plain old nothing more than a bunch of numbers that mean less than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let's not forget that your average Linux desktop distro has 10-20x more applications bundled with it than Windows does, so of course the number is going to be higher.  Toss in distros that bundle PHP applications (which I never understood, but ok) and that number explodes due to XSS vulns and other similar issues found in a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of PHP apps out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, despite the report being crap, why do people insist on doing the boring old Linux vs. Windows stuff still?  There's nothing new here.  Instead of comparing them on technical merits, functionality, etc. everyone seems to be jumping on the security bandwagon and while I appreciate security is a big thing, it just gets boring to see it over and over and over again.  Do people not have anything better to write about than to conjure up the same old boring &lt;i&gt;blah&lt;/i&gt; that we've been reading about for years?  Come on guys!

The problem was the 64bit version didn't work very well.  And the commercial NX server, although it says it's for i386 and amd64, also has a lot of unresolved dependencies due to it, well, being compiled for 32bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution was to grab packages from the 32bit Mandriva.  I installed libxcomp1, libxcompext1, libnxX11_0, nxagent, nxproxy, libopenssl0.9.7, nxviewer, nxdesktop, and freenx from the 32bit contribs and then proceeded with the normal setup.  Now it works fine and oh wow, does it ever work great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I can tuck the vmware host machine into my rack and use FreeNX to connect to it on my G5, getting rid of another box and monitor from my office and a KVM switch for my keyboard/mouse.  Very very nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick, then, if you want to use FreeNX on a 64bit distro (or, at least, Mandriva) is grab the 32bit packages and supporting libs (in this case libopenssl0.9.7, libxcompext1, and libxcomp1) and it works just peachy.  Much nicer than VNC, and much faster too.  And vmware doesn't give me fits!  =)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Aaarg! VNC? FreeNX?

I recall doing VNC in the past with 10.1 and LE2005 and it working great, and that was my first move...  but I'll be danged if I could make it work with 2006/x86_64.  My VNC clients on OS X (all three that I tried) wouldn't connect to the machine...  all of them were timing out.  So then I tried installing FreeNX from contribs, got that setup, and was using the NX client from www.nomachine.com.. couldn't make that work either.  I did try getting the NX client running on Windows, and couldn't make it connect either (I didn't try running VNC on Windows, but I don't really care if any of this works on Windows anyways since my primary desktop is running OS X).  I even downloaded the demo version of the commercial NX server and couldn't even get &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; to work on the stinking machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So finally I just did an Xnest call to get my desktop up and running over SSH.  Seemed to work fantastic... gdm came up after I loosened some security I normally tighten, vmware came up, I could get into the vmware machines and type fine... but the stupid "e" key was acting like a backspace key!  WTF?!?  Ummm... unfortunately, my last name has an "e" in it so it's a little difficult to login (I had to use a gdm theme with a chooser just to get into the bloody desktop).  So even though, with that, I could log into my desktop, fire up vmware, and use it, when I tried to switch vc's in a vmware machine and log in, I wasn't able to because I couldn't type the letter "e".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I'm having a really stupid day today, or if something in my 2006/x86_64 install is severely hooped (or maybe in the case of the Xnest/VNC stuff it's all the OS X VNC clients/X server that's hooped... will try with my other 2006/x86_64 install tomorrow), but I am getting severely annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeNX sure sounds cool, but it sure would be cooler if I could actually get it to work.  Wierd and cryptic errors, even with debug logging the server doesn't tell me much and the client seems to think the server is booting it, but the server doesn't indicate why.  Aaaargh!  Could I possibly find a better way to waste a day?!?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Annvixmobile is dead... =(</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/annvixmobile-is-dead.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-12-07T19:57:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-12-07T19:57:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-12-07:/blog/annvixmobile-is-dead.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, the wife managed to mash the Annvixmobile yesterday morning... geez, dealing with a car accident is no fun.

&lt;p&gt;Wasn't her fault at all... and no big deal.. heck, it's just a car (a nice one, but whatever).  Insurance will cover it, premiums will go up.. life goes on.  Big PITA in dealing with all the "after" stuff tho.  What a timesink yesterday was.  Anyways, pretty much the whole frontend got torn to shreds... the rest of it looks ok so I should know by the end of the week whether or not it's a write-off or not.  Personally, I hope it is... then we can get something new.  I don't know if I'll fully trust a car that's had that much damage to it.  I'll know in a few days I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just glad she's ok... banged her head a bit... sore muscles, a bit shook up... but nothing more serious than that.  The other guys in the truck that she hit are ok to, so that's good... and my daughter wasn't in the car so that's even better.  Really stupid tho... slippery roads, uncontrolled intersection... the idiots in the truck were going much faster than they should have been and even tho my wife stepped on the brakes, she slid right into them (then proceeded to do a 360 (twice) and ended up on the sidewalk... thank God no one was taking their dog for a walk right then).  So even tho my wife got a ticket (they said excessive speed, but they couldn't prove it), we're gonna go to court next month to fight it (I really don't feel like paying a $170 ticket.. nice kick in the ass on top of getting a car with 2382km smashed up).  I figure since her air bags didn't deploy, she couldn't have been going that fast (I read that in the manual... hmmm... I must be a geek... I read a car manual).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  Today I managed to get more accomplished (hello perl), but yesterday was a bit of a write-off.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Moving to a colo</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/moving-to-a-colo.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-12-05T17:06:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-12-05T17:06:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-12-05:/blog/moving-to-a-colo.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, this is my first machine moving to the new colo facility.

I've never tried it before today so I figured I'd give it a go and check it out.  My first comment: not a big fan of brown.  I'm not an "earthy" kinda guy (nevermind that my first character in any MMoRPG is a druid).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuration was straightforward.  Couldn't configure the wireless card during install, but no big deal.  Text-based installers I'm cool with... after all, this one is easier than the Annvix installer.  =)  People who say the Ubuntu installer is faster are smoking crack... it's just as slow as everything else (or as fast, depending on your hardware I guess).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that I've not really looked at any Linux distros in a few years...  I upgrade every Mandriva release on my laptop and desktop machines, but otherwise I'm using OS X for my desktop so I'm not so "bleeding edge" or even really up to speed with a lot of the new stuff that comes out for desktop Linux...  I more concentrate on the server stuff where Linux is concerned.  I played with SUSE 9.3 on this libretto after Mandriva LE2005 seemed less than satisfying, but it was worse so I only really looked at it for an hour or two before going back to Mandriva.  This is the first Linux distro other than Mandriva that I've actually spent some time poking around with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I like is synaptic.  I like this much better than rpmdrake.  It's crisp, clean, easy to understand, and very professional looking.  I like it a lot.  rpmdrake should either be remodelled to look/feel more like this; I think it's stellar.  Not sure how well it works with urpmi or even rpm, but I understand it's in Mandriva somewhere (never used it before today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I like is the online update notifier thing.  I realize mdkonline is similar, but I think Mandriva could learn from this...  not only was it easy and painfree, but a little bulb pops up on the menu bar that indicates there is a task to be done (once the updates were installed).  Then you get a popup window saying the linux kernel had been updated and the user is recommended to reboot immediately.  That's actually kinda freaky... other than Windows and OS X, I've never been told to reboot after an update... but for a kernel, it makes sense.  A little touch, but I thought it kinda neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that really made me want to look at Ubuntu was the fact that it's GNOME-based, and that it comes with version 2.12.1 rather than 2.10 which Mandriva comes with.  I'm not keen on waiting a year to get to play with 2.12, and I don't have time to muck with cooker.  I also like the fact that it comes without KDE... yippee!  That's a load of crap I don't need (sorry to all the KDE folk out there, but I haven't liked KDE since 1.x and I still don't like it).  GNOME is much more refined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like the fact that everything runs through sudo.  I love sudo.  I think sudo is the best thing since sliced bread, aside from openssh.  I love that I only have to type my password to get into administrative stuff rather than the root password... my root passwords are so long and cryptic that I usually don't use them... unless I need to administrate something on a Mandriva box with the Mandriva tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I also noticed which was kinda neat is that Ubuntu properly shows the CPU frequency of this machine.  On Mandriva, it was always showing 1GHz, but with Ubuntu, I can see it scale between 598MHz (seems to be the default) up to 1GHz (rarely).  Not a major thing, but kinda neat.  The one thing that concerns me is that the gkrellm temperature sensor says this little guy is running at 72C.  Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whoah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  One of the problems I had with Mandriva 2006 (and LE2005 before it) on this machine was that I was unable to suspend the laptop.  When I did, it would suspend ok, but crap out on startup or just boot the machine like normal.  In fact, I don't recall ever having a suspend work on anything other than a mac.  Maybe just my luck, but half the time it wouldn't even work properly with Windows.  Well, blow me over, but my first attempt at suspending Ubuntu worked.  I'll be danged.  Even the networking came back properly.  Now I'm going to try hibernating (hmm... can you tell that I'm writing as I fiddle with this thing?).  Hibernating worked good too... came up ok, networking came back too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never could tell the difference between suspend and hibernate before (likely because neither ever worked for me), but I can see it now... suspend brings you back quicker to the OS (probably stored in memory or something) whereas hibernate seems to write to the disk because when I turned the machine back on, it booted up; I selected the kernel I was using from grub and up she went.  Good, perhaps, if you need to boot into Windows or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is extremely irritating.  Now the fricking machine is making this continous beep and won't shut up.  Holy crap that's annoying.  Dunno why it did that.. maybe due to the hibernate?  It started about 3 minutes after resuming from the hibernation.  Whatever it was, I had to power down to make it stop.  Bad bad bad.  I'd rather have it not work than do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to play with it some more to see if it was actually the hibernation that caused that beep or something else (the rest of the desktop felt sluggish too, so maybe hibernating isn't quite there yet although it's further here than it is in Mandriva (at least on this machine)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'll keep Ubuntu on this machine for a bit... seems like a cute little distro although the first thing I changed was the "Human" theme... ick.  Not my style.  Also, installing the other repositories (multiverse and something else... machine is off now so I can't check... universe maybe?) are a good idea to add.  That's the only way I could get gkrellm on there, although I miss the gkrellm-themes package from Mandriva... what's wrong with these people?  How hard is it to package a few wee themes for gkrellm?!?  The stock skin is so... ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it's not bad.  I don't think it's the most user-friendly distro out there... I think Mandriva has it beat hands-down on user-friendliness, but I do think it has a few things that deserve some prodding... things that could make Mandriva better.  I'll be the first to admit that 2006 is probably one of the most professional looking/feeling versions we've put out in a while...  the cracked out Tux in LE2005 was a serious disappointment.  But it could certainly do with more refining... and Ubuntu looks like they've done a bit to make it feel refined.  Of course, that could be the fact that it's GNOME and GNOME is just so much more polished than KDE (which we put too much focus on and, I think, doesn't work half as good as GNOME).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I stumble across anything else of interest, I'll post it.  For what it's worth, as far as the hardware support goes, Ubuntu is just as good as Mandriva... better when it came to configuring X... it got the resolution and everything correct without me having to do a thing, which is cool.  Otherwise, I'm still waiting for someone to support this SD card reader built into this thing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>ABBA goes metal?</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/abba-goes-metal.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-11-29T16:40:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-11-29T16:40:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-11-29:/blog/abba-goes-metal.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This cracks me up.

&lt;p&gt;Good lord what an immense job that was.  And what a mess that wiki was!  Pages with 3 lines of text on it??  What?!?  You gotta be kidding me.  That's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; good organization there.  Makes it harder than necessary to use.  So it was a matter of re-organization to make things more logical, combining pages that should have been single pages in the first place, and then adding a bit of style to make things stand out more.  Of course, each page still has to be re-checked and not everything is imported but, honestly... 11hrs of working on that thing is more than enough.  Time for the community to take the reigns and finish it off (although I may lend a hand yet).  Might do some more tomorrow, once I build those PHP updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the new site is up and I think it looks good.  &lt;a href="http://mandriva.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;http://mandriva.vmlinuz.ca/&lt;/a&gt; is the URL.  It's certainly faster than TWiki.  I'll take PHP-based over Perl-based anyday.  And once I throw mcache support in there, it should be even faster since it should cut down database hits by about 90% or more (which is always a good thing).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Oh those fricking spiders!</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/oh-those-fricking-spiders.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-11-11T21:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-11-11T21:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-11-11:/blog/oh-those-fricking-spiders.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I swear... if another spitting venom thingamajobby kills me I will freak right out.

Both have recently been released, both are "heavy weight" IDE's (Integrated Development Environments).  Zend Studio deals particularly with PHP... that's Zend's bread and butter, so it makes sense.  Komodo, on the other hand, is more of a programmer's editor in that it does PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, XSLT, and Tcl.  Of course, you can use either as an editor for other languages, but most of the IDE features beyond syntax highlighting would be, obviously, unavailable.  They both weigh in at about the same size, which is interesting... I actually thought that Zend would be bigger due to the inclusion of PHP, etc. but then again, Komodo does deal with a larger number of languages.  The proof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
vdanen@odin:/Applications/Tools/ &gt;% du -sh Zend\ Studio\ 5
82M     Zend Studio 5
vdanen@odin:/Applications/Tools/ &gt;% du -sh Komodo.app     
93M     Komodo.app
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, on with the comparison!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing is how they open.  Not a big deal, but Komodo has this neat "Start Page".  It shows you recently opened files and projects, links to help tutorials for the different languages it supports and demos.  This is something I always liked about Komodo.  Zend just opens up into a blank document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each has a multi-pane view; by default Komodo's panels are off, but there are buttons to toggle them.  With Komodo, on the left you get the file tree view split into two tabs: Projects and Code.  Without a defined project, the Projects tab is empty.  The Code browser shows you currently opened files.  Clicking the triangle next to the file name will break down functions, variables, and whatnot.  Double-click on any of these will take you to where they are defined in the code.  There's even a little box below the code browser that shows you function comments if you defined them in the code.  There's a search box to help you find what you're looking for and the list is slimmed down as you type.  Nice feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zend, on the other hand, also uses the left panel to inspect files and projects.  It's inspector isn't quite as nice... it shows functions and included files, like Komodo, but doesn't show comments.  Double-clicking will take you to where the function is defined in the code.  Alas, unlike Komodo, it doesn't show variables.  One thing it does have that's kind of neat is a "PHP Inspector" that will let you look at all the defined functions and constants that PHP uses.  It's kind of goofy tho.. it needs to open the documentation with a browser, but the shell script it uses doesn't seem to work... when I pointed it to Safari directly (unfortunately, you can't just point it an app, but have to dig deep into it... for instance, to use Safari as the browser I used "/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari"... not very nice) it opened a second instance of Safari and made Saft think it had crashed.  Uh oh.  Good thing nothing happened to the first Safari process or I'd be re-typing all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's irritating that the ./runBrowser.sh definition that's in there doesn't work... from the commandline, it works fine.  I'll have to file a bug about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zend, the right pane is for debug output... this lets you see what your script is doing.  The bottom pane is for debug messages and there's also a debug window that will let you inspect variables, watches, stack, breakpoints, and the output buffer from the debug session.  If you're note debugging, a simple click on the window name will minimize them and allow you to see more of your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Komodo, the bottom pane is for various informational views; breakpoints, command output, and "SCC Output" (or the output of source code control stuff... cvs, subversion, etc.).  One neat thing with Komodo is the right pane... it's the Toolbox browser.  This was a new feature in Komodo 3, IIRC, and I never really got to play with it much although it seemed really cool.  The Toolbox contains snippets of code; the samples show HTML snippets that when you double-click get added to the code.  You can even configure URLs as snippets.. a quick way to get to some online documentation.  Defining a toolbox entry is easy... create a new snippet, add the code you want it to insert, give it a name, and you can even bind it to a hotkey.  This is actually an extremely slick feature... you can have it so that at the touch of a key (say ALT-CTRL-F) you could have it put in a function definition complete with a section for code comments, etc.  Zend needs to get a feature like this (man, I had completely forgotten about this feature!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait!  It does have a feature like this... just not as prominent.  Nice thing to stumble across.  Zend has a feature called Code Snippets and it can update the snippets from Zend's website.  Damn!  I wish I had noticed this before.  Zend!  What's wrong with you?  Why not make this more obvious?!?  Looks like the code snippets are user-contributed to boot, so you can keep getting new code snippets and they're broken down into different categories.  Wow.  Now I'm impressed.  Go to &lt;b&gt;Edit-&amp;gt;Show Snippets&lt;/b&gt; to check this out.  I don't like the fact that it floats in another window... I much prefer how Komodo has their Toolbox laid out, but I'll take what I can get.  This is something I'm going to be exploring a lot more of soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much it for the interface.  The Komodo interface looks nicer, but it's Mozilla-based rather than some java thing.  Yes, that means that, like Zend, Komodo isn't very "OS X-ish", but it still looks clean.  I find the layout looks better than Zend's does.  You can always tell a java app... they all look kinda... ugly.  Komodo just looks like an app running under X11, which is ok with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm... looks like Zend's Code Analyzer function has taken a step backwards with the final release, or they're being more picky.  BTW, the Code Analyzer is awesome... I find it extremely useful.  Not as good as debugging or profiling, but works really handy for looking at code and offering suggestions for things or letting you know if a defined variable is never used, etc.  Helps to make things more efficient and catches some stuff you might not otherwise notice.  But it seems a little wonky now...  for instance, it's telling me that there is an "Unused function argument: $md5 (line 384) in the following piece of code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
function mkmd5($md5)
{
    global $debug, $distar;
    $marray = array();

    foreach($md5 as $name =&gt; $val)
    {
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ummm... yeah... $md5 is being used... it's right there in the foreach().  The RC didn't pick that one up.  Then it has the balls to tell me that the value of the variable was never used.  Well, sure... it's because it's an array silly.  That's why we're using a foreach.  The value of $md5, all on it's own, is "Array" and that wouldn't be overly useful now would it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gripes aside, the code analyzer is extremely useful.  I really like it.  Komodo doesn't have anything like this... all it has is the debugger (which is ok, but I've never actually gotten it to work nicely for me in the past).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the debuggers... I can't speak for either of them.  I've tried to setup the Zend stuff in the past to make the debugger work but my firewalls keep getting in the way.  Apparently there is a way to tunnel debugging messages through an open port to work with firewalls, but I couldn't make that work either (although, in all fairness, I didn't try overly hard).  I do need to attempt to get that working, tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh!  A new feature in Zend is code folding.  This is cool, but something Komodo has had forever (so I was natually excited to see it appear in Zend).  Now, when you edit a PHP file, there's a little +/- box next to the start of a function, click on this and the function folds.  Line number count stays accurate... ie. your function may start on line 302, fold it, and the next line below the folded function is 380, so line numbering is consistant.  This is great... but... Komodo has had it for way longer, and much better to boot.  You think "function folding" is cool?  Komodo's code folding smokes it.  You can fold functions, if statements, foreach, for, while, and so on.... in fact, anything you use curly braces for, you can fold.  I'm not sure why Zend didn't carry it further... granted, folding functions and getting them out of the way is awesome, but being able to fold if statements and such as well is extremely useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Zend Studio has that I like is an SQL browser.  This allows you to connect to an SQL server (be it MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or whatever) from within Zend itself.  This is really useful when you're working on a script with database connectivity.  You can walk a tree view of the database server and look at different databases, tables, and so forth.  Now, it's just a &lt;b&gt;browser&lt;/b&gt; mind you, not an editor, so it's not a replacement for something like phpMyAdmin, but it works in a pinch.  To me, this isn't a be-all end-all feature, so it doesn't disappoint that Komodo doesn't have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Komodo has that Zend doesn't (and this lends itself more to the fact that Komodo deals with perl and other languages) is the regular expression toolkit.  This is really slick.. it helps you build regular expressions.  For someone like me who pretty much sucks with regexps, this is handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Komodo has a lot of features that Zend doesn't have, such as a GUI builder.  You can use Komodo to build GUI applications, but only with Perl/Tk, Python/Tkinter, Ruby/Tk, and Tcl/Tk.  It also gives Perl, Python, and Tcl programmers an interactive shell which lets you type code and watch it being stepped through as you go.  Kinda neat, and I can see it being exceptionally useful for the perl/python types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both IDE's can handle CVS and Subversion, which is great.  I've recently switched over from CVS to Subversion, so having the capability to commit from within the IDE is nice.  Zend's svn support works quite well.. Komodo, I'm not so sure of.  The only source control setting I seem to have with my script (which is in subversion and the working copy is in my local subversion copy) is to remove it.  That doesn't sound good at all.  Can't see anything I'd need to configure in the preferences tho.. bug maybe?  Wierd.  Using one of my old CVS files, the property inspector shows that it's update to date at revision 1.1 but the only SCC control I have is to add it.  That seems wrong too.  Methinks Komodo has some issues with SCC as it seems neither subversion nor CVS is working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the bottom line, is they both have some quirks, they're both good and capable IDEs, and they both serve different purposes.  It's a fact that Komodo's main language support is perl and python; PHP is something that is supported, but it seems to lag a little behind the support for perl and python.. maybe lag isn't the right word... PHP doesn't have some of the more powerful features that perl and python support does; but that could also be due to the language itself and the interpretters.  Suffice it to say, Komodo is meant as an all-around IDE, and it does very well at it.  I've heard rave reviews from other beta testers who are more perl or python programmers.  Me... not so much.  I avoid perl if I can, and I've never tried python.  I like PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, Zend seems to be a better fit for me.  Sure, I like some of the features Komodo has better... I like the way it looks and feels better.  But I think Zend has got a handle on what a PHP programmer wants, and Zend Studio delivers.  If you do programming with more than just one language, and/or you do PHP programming but it's not your main language you code in, Komodo is probably a better fit than Zend.  If I did more perl programming (or, rather, if I liked perl more), I'd probably end up using Komodo more just because if I used it for perl, got familiar with it, built up my code toolbox, I'd be more apt to use the same IDE to work with PHP than switch back to Zend just for PHP work.  Since almost all the coding I do is in PHP (and I can't see that letting up since I just converted a fairly hefty perl script to PHP and the dang thing runs twice as fast), I'll stick with Zend and it's arguably better PHP support.  Komodo, I'll keep it around and installed and probably play with it some more.  After all, it does syntax highlighting for almost every language out there (even my bash scripts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, to wrap this up (yes, my druid... I know you want to slaughter some furbolgs!) I feel sorry for the poor fellow you decided it wasn't worth his time to try out Zend because the installer failed so miserably (as he put it) and because it didn't conform to a nice Mac package.  His &lt;b&gt;total&lt;/b&gt; loss (my entry earlier today noted that blog entry).  If he doesn't have time to install a new version of java to play with it, he probably wouldn't have time to explore and goof off in the IDE either, and he'd be missing a whole bunch of cool features.  He uses BBEdit, and granted, so do I, but rarely for PHP code (my wife does to edit some websites, but she's not doing very much there).  BBEdit's PHP syntax highlighting is not nearly as nice as what Zend or Komodo offer, and it doesn't have the great features that both IDE's have, like debugging.  Yup, it has subversion support (which is great), but BBEdit is just a glorified text editor.  A great one, don't get me wrong, but it's not an IDE.  If you type stuff wrong in BBEdit, it won't tell you that you did... it'll just let you do it.  Komodo and Zend both give visual cues when they detect syntax errors... something that can save a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Komodo vs. Zend... well, I'd have to say that if you're just doing PHP... Zend is a clear winner.  If you're a jack-of-all-languages, you'll probably be more interested in Komodo.  If you're a total geek (or loser, take your pick) like me, then you'll want both just for kicks.  =)  Personally, I'll stick with Zend.  I keep watching what the Komodo folks are doing... it's been a long time since I used Komodo for anything other than goofing off, but that's because I changed my main platform and they didn't follow.  It only took me a little over a year of begging for an OS X version to get it, and that's gotta count for something.  My kudos to the Komodo development team.  (I also like that Komodo is a Canadian product... too bad Vancouver's gonna get all soggy for the next few months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, for what it's worth, this "review" is based on the OS X versions of the programs.  Both Zend Studio and Komdo are cross-platform, so if you work on OS X, Linux, Windows, Solaris, etc. you'll be pleased to note that you can use either program on any platform now (and I believe one license covers all platforms as well, which is nice).  For me, that's a must... being able to use the same program on my desktop, powerbook, or my libretto is really important to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Zend Studio 5.0 released</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/zend-studio-50-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-11-09T16:16:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-11-09T16:16:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-11-09:/blog/zend-studio-50-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of Komodo 3.5 for OS X, the final version of Zend Studio is now available too (upgrading as I write this).

I've been using the betas for a while, and I think it's a great upgrade over version 4.  I'm a little concerned by the comments and writeup in another blog &lt;a href="http://golgote.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2005/11/08/very-first-impressions-of-zend-studio-installation-on-mac.html#comments"&gt;In Golgota&lt;/a&gt;, that had a fairly negative write up about Zend as far as Mac integration and such goes.  I can honestly say that Zend on OS X runs &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; and the issues he's seeing, I've not seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, he complains that he can't relocate where it installs... sure you can.  I put mine in /Applications/Tools/Zend Studio 5/.  No problem there.  Then he complains that the bin/ folder contains a bunch of files.. well... ok... not a big deal really, just don't look in it.  Use the created alias or make your own (I aliased /Application/Tools/Zend Studio to /Applications/Tools/Zend Studio 5/bin/ZDE... not hard).  Then he complains about how stuffit won't archive a zip file?  Blame stuffit!  All I did was go to the resulting zip file, double-click on it in the Finder, and voila... unarchived.  That's a complaint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the java bit goes... this is noted on the Zend website.  It expliticly states (somewhere) that you need a newer java than what comes stock with OS X (I think in the product requirements section).  So what?  Just one extra download.  Doesn't interfere with the system java and happily works alongside it.  Granted, he does have a point... it would have been nice if the installer checked for the appropriate java version and then told you where to get it if it couldn't find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I'm loving Zend Studio 5.  I played a bit with Komodo after I installed it, but I think I've become to used to Zend to really feel comfortable in Komodo anymore.  Golgote has an issue with Zend?  He'd have fits with Komodo.  At least Zend provides it's own copy of PHP... Komodo doesn't, and can't use the verison of PHP installed with OS X.  Instead, it points you to a third-party PHP suite (which, granted, is well done and quite good).  Not sure about the requirements in Komodo for the other languages, although they do recommend ActivePerl, ActivePython, etc. (ie. ActiveState's builds rather than the system-installed builds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm gonna have to sit down and compare Komodo to Zend... I've got both versions fully registered (and the pro version of Komodo to boot) so it'll be interesting to see what's what.  As it stands now, I prefer Zend... but it's also because I've become comfortable with it and it's layout.  Maybe once I monkey around with Komodo as I compare them, I'll go back to it... I used to be a die-hard Komodo fan (still on the beta team, in fact.. just haven't been able to do much since it a) didn't run on OS X, and b) didn't work well with the x86_64 version of Mandriva).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>64bit guest emulation... enter QEMU</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/64bit-guest-emulation-enter-qemu.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-11-08T09:57:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-11-08T09:57:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-11-08:/blog/64bit-guest-emulation-enter-qemu.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I have a definite need to have virtual machine support for 64bit guests so imagine how pleased I was when vmware indicated that the new version of workstation (5.5.0) would have support for 64bit guests.

Then, reading the fine print, discovered that I would need to buy a new CPU (won't work with older AMD64 CPUs) and then a new motherboard to go with it, and the extras... new RAM and probably a new video card.  Unimpressed, I'm looking at an alternative called QEMU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QEMU virtualizes a lot more than just a 32bit PC; it can also emulate x86_64, sparc, ppc, and a few others I think.  My only real interest is in virtualizing x86_64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, nice as that sounds in theory (and most of the people I've talked to use it to virtualize a 32bit OS... something I'm not interested in because vmware does that quite nicely).  Well, trying to load Mandriva 2006/x86_64 in QEMU is a bit of a bummer... not only does lilo and grub both segfault, but I can't get past the bloody bootloader during install!  So three times I've tried now and three times I've been unable to complete the installation.  Not happy in the slightest.  I remember older Mandrake releases would let you skip past stuff, but apparently not anymore (bad idea, in my opinion... we need a "skip" button on some stuff like crashing bootloaders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying with LE2005 now...  if I can get most of the supported distros running in QEMU, that just means one less distro to chroot for security testing.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it too late?  I dunno... I've been using Zend Studio for a while now and I've come to really like it.  The latest version with the code folding is &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; nice (well, other features as well, of course).  So I've got the ability to use the OS X version of Komodo now due to my licenses for the Windows/Linux version.  I played with the beta a bit, but didn't have much time to really get into it... seemed ok tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I use it as a PHP IDE, which is what I originally got it for?  I'm not sure...  Zend Studio does pretty good there.  I'll have to fiddle with it and see which I like better.  Komodo also does Perl, Tcl, Python, and now Ruby too, so it's a more overall IDE than Zend Studio.  Cool, but I'm primarily a PHP coder so it doesn't matter so much to me... =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell I guess.  I'll do some work with it and see how I like.  I haven't much done anything with Komodo since I moved my desktops to either OS X or Mandriva/x86_64 and since Komodo was a 32bit app, with no 64bit version, it caused me nothing but grief on Mandriva/x86_64 (which is why I went to Zend).  I would have been more than happy to work with Komodo on my laptop if it worked.  I'll make some notes as to which I like better once I've had more of a chance to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;

It was quite a surprise this morning when I was reading through my daily logging reports and found that I had a process spring up since yesterday's report telling me that a program named ./r0nin was newly listening to port 1666 on one of my web servers.  So aside went the mozilla testing to take a peek as this is a client webserver and, well, I don't take kindly to tampering of any sort.  Besides, it's been a while since I put my forensic skills to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me give you the lowdown and if nothing else, it'll serve as a reminder to me who, thankfully, has only had to do this once before (damn phpNuke!).  Now it's damn a lazy client who decided running WordPress 1.3alpha2 was a good idea, especially considering all the xmlrpc noise that's been made lately.  How's that for a quick summary?  Read on for the goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first notice was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Security Warning: There are modifications for port listening on your machine :
                -  Opened ports : tcp        0      0 *:1666                  *:*                     LISTEN      24465/r0nin
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that sure didn't look good.  So I examined the other email reports (these are coming from rsec, the baby-brother of msec designed for Annvix).  The other reports didn't bring to light anything of interest.  My tripwire report showed nothing had changed within the last 24hrs of the stuff I monitor (which doesn't include the web roots, which I may change).  So at least no binaries had been tampered with, which is a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to find r0nin on that machine.  A quick &lt;b&gt;find / -name r0nin&lt;/b&gt; found it in the web root of one of my client's websites.  Now, this client runs a lot of different packages... geeklog, gallery, and wordpress; probably a few other things I didn't immediately notice.  Anyways, in the webroot was r0nin, w00t, uselib24, and dc.txt.  The first three were executables, the last a perl script which identifies itself as "Data Cha0s Connect Back Backdoor".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I know which site is at fault... I have the timestamps of the files indicating they were placed there or modified at 15:00, 15:06, 15:05, and 15:05 respectively (all on Sep 25).  Time to scrub some logfiles.  Doing some manual "surfing" of the logfiles showed me the following entries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:14:59:44 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 61 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:14:59:48 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 2696 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:14:59:56 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 110 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:15:00:20 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 13 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:15:00:25 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 1145 "-" "-"
200.164.102.51 - - [25/Sep/2005:15:00:36 -0600] "POST /wp/xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1" 200 65 "-" "-"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting.  WordPress has had a recent share of XMLRPC issues so this looked very suspicious, and it hit my timeframe.  Grepping in the wp/ directory showed me that the version was 1.3-alpha-2.  Looking at the website, 1.5.2 is out so I knew right there that the xmlrpc vulns were the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to determine whether the executables were compiled on the system or whether they were just uploaded.  Unfortunately, with the xmlrpc server, nothing got logged so I had no idea what they did through it.  But doing some grepping and strings on the binary showed me they were not built with SSP protection, which indicated they were not compiled on my system.  Great news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I've determined they got to upload their backdoor files via WordPress' xmlrpc vulns.  The files are owned by apache, and a &lt;b&gt;ps axu&lt;/b&gt; showed me that r0nin was running as user apache.  Didn't look like they obtained root this way, so this was a bit of a bootstrap.  Obviously r0nin is some daemon to spawn a shell, probably as user apache, on the system.  Note to self: see if apache can happily run with a shell set to /bin/false rather than /bin/sh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't too concerned when I saw r0nin listening on port 1666... showed me it wasn't a priv port (good), and I also firewall the snot our of my servers... I have rules in place to limit inbound &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; outbound traffic; ie. that machine can't even open an FTP connection to the outside world.  So I was pretty confident they wouldn't get in that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grepping my kernel logfiles proved me right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Sep 25 15:00:47 host kernel: Shorewall:net2all:DROP:IN=eth0 OUT= \
  MAC=00:50:ba:42:f7:0e:00:0d:bd:81:90:41:08:00 SRC=200.164.102.51 \
  DST=[my_ip] LEN=48 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=111 ID=5968 DF PROTO=TCP \
  SPT=1379 DPT=1666 WINDOW=64800 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There were three attempts within a minute of each other... wrapped manually so as not to screw up the viewing output).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same timeframe, same IP adress, and the destination port (DPT) was 1666, the port r0nin was listening to.  Thank you, Shorewall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there was nothing else logged, and nothing else suspicious, I figure the script kiddy moved on after he realized he wasn't getting in.  Poor boy.  After looking at all of this and determining that he didn't get anywhere beyond the "bootstrap" phaze of the attack, I thought I'd take a look at w00t.  I assumed, just due to the name, that it was the exploit that would yield root.  Google didn't really bring anything up, although I didn't expect it would since "w00t" is such an elite term.  You know... 3r33t and /|ll that (yes, I used to run a hacker bbs and know all the lingo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I figured, what the hell, I'll run it (as user apache, on a separate test machine, also running Annvix).  Yup.  It's a rootkit.  Nice thing is, it didn't work.  =)  strace doesn't show anything particular; lots of segfaults.  It's definitely trying to exploit the kernel, however, as it gives this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[-] Unable to determine kernel address: Operation not supported
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;uselib24 looks interesting as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[vdanen@build ~]$ ./uselib24

[-] FAILED: uselib (Function not implemented)

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what any of that means, but I'm suspecting another kernel issue.  Oh well.  [&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; this kernel exploit is fairly old, the source can be found on &lt;a href="http://packetstormsecurity.org/0501-exploits/uselib24.c"&gt;packetstorm&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough fun, time to clean this junk up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line?  Use a good fixed kernel (either a patched one from your vendor or the latest kernel.org kernel).  I'm not liking the 2.6 kernel for servers yet, so I'm using 2.4.31 with the openwall kernel patches.  Make sure your web apps are up to date; until the client fixes his wordpress install, I've set a apache deny clause to that directory so it can't be used as an attack vector anymore.  And firewalls that not only prevent incoming traffic but also outgoing are a good thing.  Remember, default DENY and selectively ACCEPT.  To DENY particular ports is pointless, if I had done that, the intruder would have gotten in (I have no reason to explicitly firewall port 1666 after all).  But because I denied everything then opened selective ports (http, https, sshd, etc.) I got my butt covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting stuff.  Hopefully it'll be another 3 years before something like this happens again.  Of course, I'm going to have to keep on top of clients.  And tighten the hatches a bit more to make it even harder, but I think overall, this one went pretty good and no real damage was done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>EverQuest2 is dead; long live WoW</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/everquest2-is-dead-long-live-wow.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-09-10T11:06:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-09-10T11:06:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-09-10:/blog/everquest2-is-dead-long-live-wow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Haven't posted in this section for a bit... but I have to admit that ever since I gave World of Warcaft a go, I haven't missed EverQuest or EverQuest2 at all.

After a couple days of struggling, I've got this little beast configured almost the way I want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toshiba Libretto is probably the smallest full-feature laptop I've ever laid eyes on.  It's got a Pentium M 1.1GHz chip, bluetooth, 802.11a/b/g, a dockable CD-RW/DVD+-RW drive, a USB-based fingeprint scanner, 2 USB2 ports, a firewire port, 10/100 ethernet, modem, PCMCIA card slot, a pin for an external monitor, 60GB HDD, 7.2" LCD screen (nice and bright!), and a SD card reader built in.  All this in a form factor of very very small (&lt;a href="http://www.toshiba.ca/web/product.grp?lg=en&amp;section=1&amp;group=1&amp;product=4470&amp;category="&gt;product page on toshiba.ca&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, getting this sucker setup was a bit of a chore and I'm not done yet by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was resize the Windows XP Home partition.  I gave it a little less than half the drive.  Next step was to install Mandriva LE2005.  This worked ok, but I couldn't get wireless working and could only get 800x600 using the fbdev driver, so I gave the 2006 RC1 a go.  Pretty much the same thing.  For kicks, I tried SUSE 9.3.  Different driver (vesa?), but same resolution.  Still no go on the wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can live with 800x600 even though the monitor supports 1280x768; what I can't live without is the wireless.  So I went back to Mandriva 2006 (the devil I know) and decided to get it working with it rather than fight with SUSE (I'm not a big fan of YaST, and SUSE seemed slower on this than Mandriva).  After some farting around, I downloaded the madwifi drivers from CVS (what came with Mandriva didn't work well, and ndiswrapper, which loaded ok, didn't seem to do anything).  Now we're getting somewhere!  Using "iwlist ath0 scan", I can pick up my AP's about 40-50% of the time.  Stupidly, Wireless Assistant (wlassistant) and the Mandriva Control Center could never, no matter how many times I refreshed/re-scanned) would never see the AP's.  As a result, I wrote a few shell scripts to set the connection and WEP, gave myself sudo access to run them as root, and off I go.  In retrospect, that was easier than changing networks via MCC anyways, although using wlassistant would have been nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I'm writing this outside, wireless, and it works peachy.  For anyone interested, I setup ath0 as a static IP address so it would come up and am using variations of the following script to make the connection (named roam-ESSID):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 down
/sbin/ifconfig ath0 down
/sbin/iwconfig ath0 essid [ESSID_NAME] mode Managed \
key [WEP_KEY]
/sbin/ifconfig ath0 up
/sbin/dhclient ath0
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works really well.  I have my doubts that I'll ever use this guy using physical ethernet, so I made sure that eth0 came down.  Oh!  I also removed ifplugd from the system and set MII_NOT_SUPPORTED=yes in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-{eth0,ath0} scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless now works like a hot damn.  I still have to figure out if I can boost the resolution on this (although 800x600 is ok), and see if I can get my MS Bluetooth mouse to work with it (I don't like the little accupoint stick).  Other than that, this machine is pretty slick.  I don't think it's doing any CPU frequency scaling, and the cpufreq package seems to contain just an initscript to load the modules but nothing to set any kind of profile.  I think I'd also like to be able to suspend the machine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still quite a bit to do yet, but so far I'm really enjoying this little guy.  And would you look at that!  My typing seems to be faster on it now too!  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt;  Played with suspending the machine using suspend-scripts.  "pmsuspend2 memory" seemed to work well, my power light was blinking which it never did in Windows when I tried to suspend it (which, incidentally, doesn't suspend worth crap either... oh to be a mac).  Anyways, powering it back on restored the image and then it shut off.  Nice.  Tried to use "pmsuspend2" just to suspend to disk and it worked, turned it on, came up quite quick, then rebooted by itself.  Interesting difference is that when suspending to disk, I got unclean filesystems; suspending to ram didn't although the end result was the same.  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oooo!  Adam Williamson is my fricking hero!  On his suggestion, I tried the i810 xorg driver and set the resolution to 1280x768.  Worked like a charm.  Now I have to squint to read anything again, but I have more screen room.  Thanks, Adam!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only things left to do are to get the SD card reader working and bluetooth (and by the looks of things, trying to get a bluetooth mouse working on it will be an exercise in PITA).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>iBook iNsanity?</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/ibook-insanity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-08-16T20:49:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-08-16T20:49:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-08-16:/blog/ibook-insanity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh my God...

For one, the organizers should be shot.  1000 ibooks for $50 and only 5 cops for crowd control?  I'm amazed the cops weren't trampelled (although they did bring in another 70 cops (20 in riot gear) and 22 firemen).  &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/08/16/computer.frenzy.ap/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; has more details.

&lt;p&gt;But this one is the worst, and I swear, if I was an organizer and heard this fellow saying this, I'd refuse to sell him the gum on the bottom of my shoes because this is the worst kind of attitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Jesse Sandler said he was one of the people pushing forward, using a folding chair he had brought with him to beat back people who tried to cut in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I took my chair here and I threw it over my shoulder and I went, 'Bam,"' the 20-year-old said nonchalantly, his eyes glued to the screen of his new iBook, as he tapped away on the keyboard at a testing station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They were getting in front of me and I was there a lot earlier than them, so I thought that it was just," he said.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

I preferred the version that came with Panther!  After using it for a while, and doing a fresh install about two days ago (granted, I copied all of the old files, but still... the whole system feels spunkier so one would assume that Mail would speed up a bit as well), it's dragging like there's no tomorrow.  I get more mail than the average person...  I get over 13000 emails in a month and that doubles because I have every email copied into an archive folder (so if I need to find something a few months down the road, I can).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the big problem here is Tiger's Mail uses individual files for emails which is absolutely retarded.  What was wrong with the mbox format?  Absolutely nothing.  Server-side, I prefer using Maildir to store email... it's much more efficient and safer, but for a client, I've been using mbox since forever.  This slowness is almost making me want to switch back to mutt for crying out loud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many people, I have some very strict requirements when it comes to email and that's only because I use it all the time and because I get so bloody much of it.  The absolute first thing it needs is GPG support because I sign every single piece of email I send out.  That rules out a whole lot of Mac-based email clients.  For two, I need a good way of sorting messages and while Mail.app is passable, it's not at all what I would like (regexp anyone?)... but I make do.  For three, I'm really loving SpamSieve... I think that is the best dang piece of spam-killing software around.  I absolutely love it.  My email client should ideally make use of it.  Finally, because I use DayLite for contact management, any mail client I use should be able to use AddressBook as a... well... address book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leaves me in a quandry.  Only Mail.app does all of these things (with the exception of regexp-based rules... boolean rules are ok I suppose).  I'd really like to give Thunderbird a go, but it doesn't support SpamSieve, and I really don't feel like re-training the spam handler it comes with.  It's got the other bases covered, except I don't think it supports AB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to use mutt, and I'm very much tempted to go back to it.  The only thing I'll lose is SpamSieve, which will be sorely missed, but I suppose I could use SpamAssassin in it's place.  I did have mutt capable of using AddressBook in the past, I can probably do so again (although I've since misplaced my ~/.mutt config files... grrr...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the other Mac email clients pretty much suck.  I wouldn't mind MailSmith, but the bone heads at BareBones insist that you should use PGP and provide no support for GPG... I guess if they figure someone's gonna spend 3x more than what it reasonable for an email client, they'll buy PGP to boot.  I'm aware that there is a free version which would be sufficient, but the last time I tried to convert my GPG key to a PGP key (just for kicks) I came up with a whole lot of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don't get is what Mail.app sucks so bad now.  Maybe using Smart Mailboxes isn't so smart... or maybe it's Spotlight slowing things down.  I'm guessing it's my high number of emails and each one being an individual file.  I don't get it.  This new version seems like a major regression and this is probably the only thing I dislike about Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't be the only person using a Mac who deals with high volume of email.  What do other folks use that have a large number of mails they need to deal with?  I don't mind paying for a solution that works... in fact, if it does everything I need, I'd gladly fork the money over.  Heck, if Mailsmith did everything I needed, I'd pay for a license despite how ridiculous the price is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I'll try a few things like disabling Smart Mailboxes in Mail.app and see if that makes a difference, but I really shouldn't have to disable one of the funky new features in an app in order to make it perform as well as the old version, should I?  For the record, Panther's Mail.app with it's mbox files performed admirably; I never had a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and before someone thinks that this is a processor or RAM issue, I'm running this on a dual 1.8GHz G5 with 2.5GB of RAM... the processor or RAM is definitely &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>How I hate thee LDAP authentication...</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/how-i-hate-thee-ldap-authentication.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-07-18T15:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-07-18T15:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-07-18:/blog/how-i-hate-thee-ldap-authentication.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find LDAP for authentication highly irritating.

It's better than some alternatives, like NIS (haven't looked at NIS+ so I don't know how it measures up), but man oh man, it's a real nuisance sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote that LDAP Authentication piece when there was essentially nothing else and it took a long time to figure out all the bits.  Now it seems like LDAP for authentication is all the rage.. everyone uses or wants to use it and I understand why.  In a large company or organization, it makes sense.  From that standpoint, centralized authentication is awesome.  But to administer the beast?  Good Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back when I first wrote the LDAP for Authentication paper, you used pam_pwdb in conjunction with pam_ldap and with a little massaging, you could make it so you could use the passwd program to change (you guessed it) passwords.  Then after a while, distros changed, other stuff changed, and pam_pwdb didn't work so good anymore.  At that point, pam_unix was the solution and it works great for doing lookups for authentication, but I've just realized (at least on my systems) it's pretty poor for handling password changing.  I can authenticate fine, but when I want to change my password, pam_unix is telling me that my username isn't in /etc/passwd or available by NIS.  Well, no duh... it's in the LDAP directory.  You're supposed to silently fail, fall back to pam_ldap, which will tell you everything is ok and I can carry on.  For kicks I tried switching back to pam_pwdb but it's just as dumb and I can't authenticate with it (I'm pretty sure it's trying to read from /etc/{passwd,shadow} directly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, thank goodness for PHPLdapAdmin.  At least I can change my password with it, but boy is it annoying that something that worked for me two years ago no longer works.  The really irritating thing is that it makes my document useful as a reference, but kinda useless for a real-world "hold my hand and let's do it".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerberos is easier than this for crying out loud and I used to think (mind you, about 5-6 years ago) that Kerberos was difficult.  Kerberos is a piece of bloody cake!&lt;/p&gt;

I'd like to list a few of the essentials and favourite apps that I use for OS X (I'll do another list later for Linux).  There are a lot of great applications out there... some open source and/or free, some shareware, and some commercial.  I think each have their place and unlike some people, I don't necessarily go for the open source and/or free ones first.  I go for what fits my needs and if it works as I need, I'll pay for it.  If I can find something just as good (or better) open source, then I'll obviously take that first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, let's get on with the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to break the list down by application/usage type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Development Tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By development tools I mean things like IDE's, text editors, etc.  Most of my development is in PHP (web design, web apps), with a little bit of perl, shell scripting, and applescript (sorta, still learning it) thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.zend.com/store/products/zend-studio/"&gt;Zend Studio&lt;/a&gt; - an excellent PHP IDE written in Java.  Although I prefer ActiveStates's &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/"&gt;Komodo&lt;/a&gt;, there isn't an OS X-native version (yet).
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml"&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt; - an excellent text editor with syntax highlighting, awesome regexp support, and lots lots more.  A little expensive, but if you like the features it has, well worth it.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://yoursql.ludit.it/"&gt;YourSQL&lt;/a&gt; - a good tool to create and manipulate SQL databases (open source).
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/administrator/1.0.html"&gt;MySQL Administrator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_new" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/query-browser/1.1.html"&gt;MySQL Query Browser&lt;/a&gt; from the MySQL developers.  These are new(ish) tools (at least on OS X) but they work great for administering MySQL databases
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Browsers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web browsers.  Love 'em or hate 'em.  Here's a few I like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Safari - of course.  In Tiger it's much better, although I don't like the RSS support, but that's just me.  It's my normal every-day browser
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; - great browser.  The only browser I use under Windows, I don't really care for the "feel" of it under OS X.  Having said that, the web developer tools plugin is second to none and that in itself makes Firefox essential for debugging websites.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/"&gt;OmniWeb&lt;/a&gt; - I have a love/hate relationship with this browser... it uses the same engine as Safari and has some great features (per-site preferences, screenshot tabs, and some other cool features)... unfortunately, it's kinda crashy under Tiger right now and it doesn't seem like the authors are in a hurry to update it... sometimes it makes me regret that I put out money for it, but oh well
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video and Audio&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do all of my audio with iTunes.  It does absolutely everything I need.  For video, I primarily use QuickTime to view what it can, but I've found it doesn't view everything.  I try to avoid Windows Media Player unless I absolutely have to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"&gt;VLC&lt;/a&gt; - this is one wicked media player.  I found some mpeg video files that wouldn't play in WMP for OS X or in QuickTime; they'd only run in WMP on Windows and in some other third-party video viewer on Windows.  They played perfectly in VLC.  This is a recent addition to my must-haves, but after that, it's definitely one to check out.  It's also open source and free.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.lairware.com/mpfreaker/"&gt;MPFreaker&lt;/a&gt; - a program that inserts artwork  and updates MP3 ID tags... it's not free, but I really like this software as it makes managing my iTunes library a little bit easier... I know there are some freebie programs that are probably just as good or better, but I've been using this one for a while and really like it
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interface Customization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from a Linux background where I can switch from GNOME to KDE to Englightenment and skin them any which way I want, the look of my desktop is important to me.. if for nothing else than to relieve some boredom since I look at it all day long.  To that end, there are a few apps that help me manage because I think I'd go stir crazy or switch back to a fulltime Linux desktop if I had to stare at an unmodified Aqua all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/shapeshifter/"&gt;ShapeShifter&lt;/a&gt; - from the fine folks at Unsanity, this lets me change the look of the OS with themes
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.iconfactory.com/cb_home.asp"&gt;CandyBar&lt;/a&gt; - an easy-to-use and fast way to change icons for your desktop
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/"&gt;LaunchBar&lt;/a&gt; - not really something to change the look of the desktop, but with a two-key combo, I can launch any application on the system, folder, music file, etc.  Some people think that Spotlight makes LaunchBar obsolete, but I disagree.  Spotlight is a great search tool, but LaunchBar beats launching an app from the Finder and is faster than Spotlight in returning what you want... an OS X desktop feels naked without it
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/"&gt;Desktop Manager&lt;/a&gt; - this gives you virtual desktops and while from the site it sounds like it may not work too well, I've had no problems with it at all.  Again, coming from a Linux background where I routinely have at least four active virtual desktops, each with something on it, Desktop Manger is a life saver and it feels wierd when I don't have virtual desktops anymore.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.cocoatech.com/pf.php"&gt;PathFinder&lt;/a&gt; - not quite as essential as I had once thought since the Finder's had a bit of an overhaul in Tiger, this is still a good Finder replacement.  I don't use it as a Finder replacement, but I do use it instead of the Finder a lot of the time as it can be customized some more and has some great "power user" features.  Hasn't been updated in a bit, but I'm looking forward to seeing what the next version will do
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://weatherdock.alwintroost.nl/"&gt;WeatherDock&lt;/a&gt; - I used to be a WeatherPop Advance user until I found this.  Not only is it more accurate, it's also much nicer looking with a desktop overlay and menu bar status... and just as importantly, it's free
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Networking Tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From browsers to RSS readers to IRC clients... these are what I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://xchataqua.sourceforge.net/"&gt;X-Chat Aqua&lt;/a&gt; - an extremely well done port of the X-Chat IRC client to use the Aqua interface.  X-Chat is all I use on Linux and I've tried a few other IRC clients for OS X and they all stink.  X-Chat Aqua is the best of the bunch, it's free, and very reliable... I live in IRC so I need something good
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/"&gt;NetNewsWire Lite&lt;/a&gt; - I don't have a problem with paying for software, but the Lite version of this good RSS reader works well enough for me and I don't need the advanced features.  For a while I was using NewsFire, but since it hit 1.0 and the author essentially said "thanks for the free beta testing, now I'm charging", I've gone back to NetNewsWire Lite.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.panic.com/unison/"&gt;Unison&lt;a/&gt; - a good NNTP client.  I've yet to find anything that comes close to Unison for news reading on OS X... this one works very well
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/"&gt;Transmit&lt;/a&gt; - version 3 of this FTP client is a much needed refresh and it's a pretty decent FTP client now.  I've also looked at &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.yummysoftware.com/"&gt;Yummy FTP&lt;/a&gt; and this looks like a really good FTP client too.  Both are shareware, and since I'd already paid for Transmit, I haven't bothered to look at Yummy much more than just to check it out... has some exceptionally nice features and in many respects is better than Transmit, but I don't use FTP enough to shell out for another program (I typically use scp or rsync for most file transfers).  The odd time I do need to use FTP I'm either using ncftp (installed via Fink) or Transmit
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.sshkeychain.org/"&gt;SSHKeyChain&lt;/a&gt; - a nice GU frontend to managing SSH keys.  Absolutely essential for me since I can use my ssh keys now from within any terminal, BBEdit, and so on
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.adiumx.com/"&gt;AdiumX&lt;/a&gt; - an excellent open source multi-protocol instant messaging client.  I use it for the odd MSN and Jabber needs, although i use iChat for my day-to-day IM.  AdiumX is an extremely well done client, my only beef is it's based in Gaim which I think is utter crap software due to the high number of security holes that have been found in it in the last year alone
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://c-command.com/spamsieve/"&gt;SpamSieve&lt;/a&gt; - I use Apple Mail and it's junk filters are ok, but nothing great... SpamSieve is an awesome spam filter.  Makes using Mail so much nicer considering the high volume of spam I get.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.sente.ch/software/GPGMail/English.lproj/GPGMail.html"&gt;GPGMail&lt;/a&gt; - a plugin for Mail to allow for the use of GPG encryption, signing, etc. (absolutely essential for me since I sign everything I send out)
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Productivity Tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By productivity I mean things like CRM, PIM, project management, word processing, etc.  There's a lot of stuff out there, and a lot of it is awful.  Some is pretty good and I'm sure I haven't found all of the good stuff, but this is what I use and like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.marketcircle.com/daylite/index.html"&gt;DayLite&lt;/a&gt; - the best CRM (Contact Relationship Manager) I've seen for OS X.  Unlike the other tools for OS X, this one has &lt;i&gt;power&lt;/i&gt;.  It uses an SQL database for the backend which allows me to share my info between the desktop and laptop machines without any silly synchronization schemes.  Hooks well with Address Book, and moderately ok with iCal (the 2.0 promises to have better integration).  Extremely useful software although it's a bit pricey at first glance... the features make the cost well worth it (but only if you have a need for the features that can't be found in other CRM or PIM apps; for anyone who wants to share data in an organization, DayLite is a must-have)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.projectwizards.net/en/merlin"&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; - a project management app that allows for different views (Network, Gantt), budgets, resource assignments, file attachments, and more.  A very useful app that goes a long way in helping me plan my week
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.php"&gt;DevonThink&lt;/a&gt; - an excellent all-purpose tool... great for taking notes, keeping copies of websites, organizing PDF's (and making them text searchable).  DevonThink is really useful for organizing text.  I use it to keep electronic books and magazines, hints from macosxhints.com, weekly reports for work, system logs, etc.  With the quick search engine it makes finding stuff a snap.  The new PRO version promises to be a worthwhile upgrade, but a while ago they promised it would be a multi-client app, but I don't think the first PRO version will have these capabilities, which is a shame.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.planamesa.com/neojava/en/index.php"&gt;NeoOffice/J&lt;/a&gt; - a port of OpenOffice.org for OS X.  I've used OOo on OS X under X11, and let me tell you, NeoOffice/J is &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; nicer.  Normally I use a text editor like BBEdit (or joe/vim in the terminal) for working with text, and I do have a copy of Microsoft Office which I use the rest of the time, but I often get files in OOo format, and using NeoOffice/J is much more convenient (and prettier!) than using OOo under X11.  It's also GPL and free, so the price is perfect.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Miscellaneous Needed Apps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other stuff that I use/need that doesn't necessarily fall into the above categories and I just don't feel like breaking out into a bunch of new categories... =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Fink&lt;/a&gt; - a package management system and ported "Linux" apps for OS X.  They're not really Linux apps, but they're bundled open source applications to make for easy install on OS X.  This is one of the first things I install on OS X... Fink is an absolute must have (easy access to apps like ncftp, joe, vim, nmap, ethereal, and a whole whackload more... you can even install KDE via Fink!)
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html"&gt;SuperDuper!&lt;/a&gt; - the absolute best backup software for OS X I've ever laid eyes on.  Like Carbon Copy Cloner, but so much better.  I use this to create disk image backups of my drives.. these are true 100% perfect replicas of the original drive and have saved my butt a few times
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool.html"&gt;TinkerTool&lt;a/&gt; and &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerToolSys.html"&gt;TinkerTool System&lt;/a&gt; - TinkerTool is for personal settings and allows you to tweak all kinds of things; TinkerTool System is for system-wide tinkering.  TinkerTool is free, TinkerTool System costs a few dollars (not much, only 7 euros) and is well worth it with all the things you can do with it
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.jimmitchelldesigns.com/yasu.html"&gt;Yasu&lt;/a&gt; - Yet Another System Utility; not a bad little tool.  TinkerTool System and TinkerTool together do everything Yasu does and way more, but Yasu is a good tool if you don't need all the power of TT and TTS.  Great for cleaning caches, running the periodic maintenance scripts, etc.
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/"&gt;GeekTool&lt;/a&gt; - this is an awesome tool that lets you put the output of commandline commands right on the desktop.  It also does the same foor images and system logs.  The author says it's not fully compliant with Tiger and doesn't have any plans for a short term release, so use it at your own risk.  Having said that, it works wonderfully for me and I use it to view various logs that are "sticky" on the background... a great way to have logs displayed in near real-time without having a separate terminal open to tail them
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a target="_new" href="http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/"&gt;MenuMeters&lt;/a&gt; - displays CPU usage, network throughput, memory usage, and other stuff in your menu bar.. very handy
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's my list.  I'm sure there are heaps of great software out there that I've never even checked out before, but for what I need to do, these are the apps I am most often using and would have a hard time doing without.  There's probably a few that I've missed, but these are the ones I can think of right now.... regular apps are easy enough to see/remember, but it's the little things that are preference panes, etc. that are sometimes easy to miss.  If I think of more, or find some new stuff, I'll be sure to update this entry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Mandriva needs Debian?

It made for quite a good chuckle at first.  To recap, an &lt;a href="http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/newss/5900/1/"&gt;interview on LinuxPlanet with Ian Murdock&lt;/a&gt; was published yesterday indicating, among other silly rhetoric, that &lt;i&gt;"Not only can they do it, my assertion is if they don't do it, they can't survive"&lt;/i&gt; which is Ian speaking about Mandriva buying a commercial Debian-based distribution to use Debian technologies.  Of course, this comes now that Mandriva (formerly MandrakeSoft) bought Conectiva and then bought Lycoris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really amusing because, for one, Ian Murdock is the "father" of Debian and it sounds very much like he's tooting his own horn here.  He also runs Progeny, which is also a commercial Debian-based distribution.  Does it sound like Ian is asking for a buyout?  A little too much to these tired ears.  Of course, he could be more blunt by saying that Mandriva needs to buy Progeny to survive, but maybe he's a tab bit more subtle than that.  Regardless, it sounds to me like he was doing the interview with his hands out asking for Mandriva to please give him a whack of cash because without it, Mandriva won't survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what are his reasons?  The first is that Debian has a good community.  Well, so does Mandriva.  Part of the reason Mandriva survived bankruptcy is due to the community that ponied up for services like MandrakeClub.  This goes to show that Mandriva does have a strong community.  And if you look at the development arena (cooker) at Mandriva, you'll see a lot of volunteers there doing a fair amount of work.  Sure, Mandriva's community (in terms of developers) isn't as big as Debian's, but that hasn't caused it to falter at all.  If this were a drowning point, Mandriva wouldn't have the assets to even consider these last two aquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His other point is that such a buyout by Mandriva would be a huge win for Debian, who just recently released the latest stable version (Sarge) after a 31-month development cycle.  Ok, sure, this would be nice for Debian, but how does that affect Mandriva's future?  Well, it doesn't.  That directly affects Debian's future (which, in the same article, Ian has some issues with).  How does it benefit Mandriva?  It doesn't.  So, let's be clear here.  Mandriva buying a Debian-based distro benefits Debian's future.  But how does it benefit Mandriva again?  Hmmm... nowhere does he really say &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; buying a Debian-based distro will benefit Mandriva (other than the larger community pool).  Oh wait, he says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Debian has an enormous opportunity in front of it," Murdock stated, if it can remain the center of Debian-based development. Having such a free, non-commercial center would be a strong selling point for any company to use Debian, he added, including Mandriva. Keeping Debian's core non-commercial would prevent any temptations to specialize the core code into something only one distributor could use.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm... how does this benefit Mandriva again?  Oh, it's a strong selling point.  This is because there is some popularity to other Debian-based distros like Xandros, Linspire and most importantly, Ubuntu.  Does Ian think that Mandriva will sell more subscriptions to MandrivaClub and retail boxes because it can stamp a "based on Debian" logo on the box?  I doubt it.  The same people who use Debian now will continue to use Debian.  A few may switch, but probably not enough to make an aquisition worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't get it.  The whole thing is to make this radical change from Mandriva's existing software base to change not only the package management tools (dpkg and apt vs rpm and urpmi), but also to roll-back to Debian-based packages that are largely out-dated by the time they're deemed stable?  Yes, Mandriva is moving towards more stability, but come on... a 31-month development cycle?  Debian in and of itself is still Debian, still ruled by the Debian community, and not overly influenced by outside commercial offerings.  If it were, then Ubuntu would &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the new Debian because at least Ubuntu is moving and moving quickly.  And while I think Mandriva is moving from "bleeding edge" to stable, it's not going to want to use 2 year old apps because someone at Debian is asleep at the wheel.  Which then means that Mandriva development will continue as it has, it would fork Debian's base and maintain it's own repositories which it would use, and then where's the benefit?  A sticker that says "loosely based on Debian"?  Yeah, that'll sell a lot of boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be the end of my morning chuckle if I didn't get another one today.  Now we get this &lt;a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2005-06-23-011-26-OP-DB-MD"&gt;editorial piece from Brian Masinick&lt;/a&gt; on Linux Today that opens with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I think that Ian Murdock is right on with regard to speculation about the future of Mandriva."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What?!?  Has this guy been smoking the same crack Ian was?  No, wait.. Ian's not smoking crack... he's begging for a buyout, probably because Ubuntu has so severely eclipsed Progeny as to make Progeny obsolete to all but it's existing client base.  Brian here is smoking a whole different kind of crack... the blind-eyed zealous kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arguments don't even make sense.  Half his editorial is trying to explain why he has a clue.  So what?  So he started out with Slack in '95 and didn't start to use Linux on the desktop until 2001.  So he used emacs and tar back in the '80's.  That doesn't at all indicate that he has a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arguments are the same.  Community.  Debian's community.  The theoretically bought-out company's community.  Nowhere is there a single piece of technical &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it should be done.  Everything is based on community.  So both Brian and Ian are saying that Mandriva won't survive if it can't buy Debian community.  Huh?  They expect Mandriva to completely overhaul how it does everything simply to buy a piece of Debian-using community?  That just doesn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He indicates that now that Mandriva and Conectiva have merged, Mandriva has &lt;i&gt;"one of the assets in house that can help accomplish a move from RPM packaging to DEB packaging: the great synaptic tool"&lt;/i&gt;.  Eh?  I'm pretty sure synaptic is open source and freely available and it seems pretty darn expensive to buy Conectiva just for a tool any idiot can download and use.  That purchase was for entry into Latin America and the client-base that Conectiva had (read: companies and government, not so much end-users).  See, that's strategy.  Buying users just to have more users from disparate parts of the globe doesn't make sense.  It would make more sense to buy TurboLinux and get a good foothold into Asia than it would to buy XYZ Debian-based distro just to get a bunch of users from who-knows-where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, regarding tools, Brian also says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mandrake did a pretty good job of turning urpmi into a pretty decent installation tool that nearly rivals apt-get, dpkg, aptitude, and synaptic, in terms of handling application and library packaging updates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if that's the case, why on earth would they want to change?  Give me a good technical reason for moving from rpm to deb and urpmi to apt-get!  He just said that urpmi nearly rivals apt-get and these other tools.  Granted, he calls it "decent" and that it "nearly rivals" but he never quite says what's wrong with it or why it doesn't measure up.  Maybe because he doesn't think it's important, or maybe he just doesn't know.  In my experience, urpmi is fast, smart, and pretty darn good.  It doesn't "nearly" rival, it does rival.  Granted, my experience with apt-get is limited to Fink on OS X, but heck, that's enough to give you a taste for the tool, and frankly, I'd be happier using urpmi on OS X than apt-get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is the really amusing part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I like the idea of centering that user community around a Debian approach because the Debian packaging fosters community, but even more importantly, the Debian Social Contract is all about community and freedom.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why is this a compelling reason to buy a Debian-based distro?  Because a &lt;i&gt;package&lt;/i&gt; fosters community?  The only community a &lt;i&gt;package&lt;/i&gt; (manager) fosters is the holier-than-thou-apt-is-god mentality most Debian users have.  I think it's more the idea that no one owns Debian that fosters it's community by and large, not the package management tool.  Sure, some people prefer it and that's why they prefer using Debian.  From a user's perspective, apt is nice.  But urpmi is just as good and just as easy.  So let's look at it from a technical perspective:  dpkg packages &lt;i&gt;suck&lt;/i&gt;.  They are really badly put together... if there's something that needs a change, dpkg is it.  Sure, there are some benefits to it like a package can recommend another package and so on, but the bottom line is working with a dpkg is a pain and RPM has nicely laid out the spec file to do all the work, separate patch files to make maintenance of patches &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; much easier than dpkg's one-file-fits-all mentality.  When I have to pull security patches out of Ubuntu or Debian packages, I cringe because they're so painful to use once you're used to simple spec file and distinct patches.  Pulling a patch out of a Red Hat or SUSE package is 10x easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final point before I wrap this up.  Ian mentioned LSB support and whatnot for Debian as another selling point of Debian.  Guess what Ian...  LSB chose RPM as the defacto packaging system, not DEB.  So if LSB support is such a big thing, why hasn't Debian switched over to using RPM, like the LSB recommends?  For instance, in the original interview Ian says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One such benefit could be the re-establishment of Debian as the central Linux Standard Base distribution, something that was originally intended when Bruce Perens initially proposed the LSB. The LSB, Murdock feels, has been weakened by other commercial distros' lack of full participation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm... Debian is the one lacking full participation.  Has Ian not read the pertinent part of the &lt;a href="http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_2.0.1/LSB-Core/LSB-Core.html#PACKAGEFMT"&gt;LSB specs&lt;/a&gt;?  I'll quote it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Applications shall either be packaged in the RPM packaging format as defined in this specification, or supply an installer which is LSB conforming (for example, calls LSB commands and utilities).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the end of the day, Mandriva, a company committed to the LSB, is on the right track using RPM as the base, and not the non-LSB-conforming DEB packaging system.  It can be argued that DEB falls under "LSB conforming", but it's still not the recommended system.  RPM is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me a break.  I for one hope Mandriva stays as far away from Debian-based distros as possible, not only due to the inferiority of dpkg itself, but because it doesn't need this kind of clueless zealotry advocating it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>EverQuest2 character links</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/everquest2-character-links.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-06-20T22:36:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-06-20T22:36:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-06-20:/blog/everquest2-character-links.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This may be of interest to some people, but it's more of interest to me.

I can't believe that people are so stupid and/or blind!  The death of Linux?  Come on.  Microsoft might like us to believe that, but it's just more FUD.  Will Apple steal marketshare from Linux now that OS X will run on x86?  Puhlease.  Only an idiot would think so.  Want to know why?  Because Linux on the desktop doesn't have that much marketshare to steal!  And OS X for servers?  Come on, that's only for the clueless who need Apple's (albeit very very nice) hand-holding administration software (yes, the Linux crowd could do well to emulate some of the tools found in OS X Server).  Anyone who has read any performance benchmarks on any apps requiring threading is likely to run screaming in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where will Apple be stealing marketshare from?  Well, the obvious answer is Windows.  I don't think it'll steal marketshare from Linux because a) there isn't a lot there to begin with (IIRC, I read somewhere not to long ago that Linux is estimated to have 6% of the desktop market), and b) the people who use Linux on the desktop have chosen to for a reason and likely won't be swayed over to OS X.  They &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be moved from their Dell PC to an Apple desktop machine, sure, but unless Apple lowers it's prices some, I doubt that unless it's for the geeks who like shiny toys, not the zealous who prefer free beer &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; free speach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "MacTel" (what a stupid name) will be a nice system, absolutely.  Apple has refinements to their hardware that makes other PC makers drool.  I saw in a London Drugs flyer not too long ago Sony's attempt at an iMac-like system which essentially looked like a goofy LCD screen slapped onto a sideways-slanting compaq desktop (you know the old thin(ish) ones meant to sit on the desk).  It looked absolutely ridiculous.  It amazes me that Apple can come up with this stuff and the people who try to emulate it do such a crappy job.  I mean, Apple has some really smart folks there doing their hardware design, but I can't believe that the people who have the same job at Sony can dish out cobbled-together looking junk and think it's good enough to sell, much less compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, wandering...  Oh yeah.  The beautiful thing about the new x86 mac machines is that you'll be able to triple boot OS X, Windows, and Linux.  I don't blame Apple for locking OS X to their hardware... they are a hardware manufacturer after all.  Moving to the x86 platform is almost guaranteed to double their hardware sales at a &lt;i&gt;minimum&lt;/i&gt;.  I know too many people who have drooled over mac hardware but were put off because of the "bubblegum" look of OS X, or they just didn't like OS X as an OS.  And that's fine.  But now these people can buy the mac hardware they've dreamed of and still run their favourite OS, no matter &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; it is... could be Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, heck even BeOS.  The choice is limitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conjecture about Apple restricting their machines from booting Windows is equally silly.  Do people not realize that by making an "open" (sorta) system that will boot Windows, they'll sell tonnes more hardware?  Absolutely OS X is a killer desktop system, but that doesn't change the fact that sometimes I need to boot into Windows to get my EQ fix, or that someone has spent a few thousand dollars in software required for work or play that just would be too costly to re-purchase as an OS X-native app, &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; that's even an option.  But now these people can continue to run Windows, but run it on a mac.  How cool is that?  And how many more sales is that going to put under Apple's belt since that will be a viable (if unsupported) option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the last straw was reading this opinion piece here: &lt;a href="http://www.xyzcomputing.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=366&amp;Itemid=26&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=0"&gt;MacTel: A Disaster for Linux?&lt;/a&gt;.  The guy has a few decent points, but he still doesn't get it.  I think the problem is that too many journalists just don't understand Linux, or the whole OSS movement.  He disagrees with the fact that people will stop developing OSS for Linux and instead develop it for OS X, to some extent, but he by and large doesn't seem to get the fact that stuff is rarely developed "for Linux".  The things that make Linux popular weren't written "for Linux".  The OSS developers out there don't develop "for Linux".  There aren't any Linux developers to steal because they weren't there in the first place!  The only "Linux developers" are the folks working on the kernel and those developers of proprietary software specifically targetted at Linux (and even then, many of those apps are cross-platform).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Linux developers that people are afraid Apple is going to steal don't exist, so there's nothing to steal.  Was Apache written for Linux?  Nope.  Samba?  Nope.  KDE?  Not really.  All of these programs run on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, they even already run on OS X!  So what is all this worry?  That people are going to stop writing QT or GTK apps because they can write for Aqua now?  I have news for people... Apple's X11 exists, works quite well, and projects like Fink provide a large number of desktop packages written "for Linux" in the OS X environment.  Yes, sometimes there is a challenge writing code portable enough to run on x86, x86_64, PPC, PPC64... but this is nothing new... this has been happening with Sparc, Alpha, and many other platforms long before OS X came around.  Most OSS software is already cross-platform... more often than not, a few tweaks and a recompile and it's running on a different platform than what the author wrote it for.  And PPC isn't going to be forgotten by any Linux developers.  Remember who's sinking millions into Linux?  Yup, the same guys selling the POWER chips.  That's all PPC as well.  You think IBM is going to stop selling POWER-based systems now that Apple isn't using their CPUs?  Get a grip.  Yellowdog is still committed to the PPC platform.  Linux on PPC/POWER is viable and has support.  It isn't going away.  Anyone know about the Linux for XBOX projects?  Yup, it will probably carry on with the XBOX 360 (that is such a &lt;i&gt;sweet&lt;/i&gt; target to hack!), and it's also PPC-based.  Linux for PPC is going absolutely &lt;i&gt;nowhere&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't get it.  All this conjecture, all this really silly speculation, and it boils down to a few essential things.  Will Apple steal marketshare now that it's going to be running on x86 software?  Absolutely.  But it'll be people fed up with Windows and viruses and spyware and adware and all the other junk that makes Windows an absolute hell to use.  It's not going to be people who already use a Linux desktop that is free from all of these problems and that provides literally thousands of applications.  These apps can't be taken away from us, and if a developer stops working on it, someone else can pick it up.  And you know what?  They won't be stopping working on it because they all of a sudden have an urge to write an Aqua app because they bought a new "MacTel" because the first thing they will do is modify their program to work on OS X &lt;i&gt;in addition to the other OS's and platforms it already supports&lt;/i&gt;.  Do I see more OS X native software to work in conjunction with these apps?  Sure.  More Aqua frontends?  Absolutely.  But they won't replace what's already there, and it won't stifle new innovation and programs.  Projects like KDE aren't just going to up and die because people are using macs now.  With Fink, they can still develop KDE and use it &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; Aqua.  It can be done... I've done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all just so irritating...  we have no idea what will happen, but every day someone comes out with a new idea or thought that is just as ludicrous as yesterday's brain fart of the day.  People just don't get it and it's almost enough to make you scream!  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I just think it's going to rock that I can have one powerbook to carry around running XP, Mandriva, Annvix (for testing), and OS X rather than carrying around both my current powerbook and my compaq x86_64 laptop.  I'm all for this move and can't wait for some faster, more powerful, and most importantly 64bit laptops to roll out of Cuppertino.  I use what I use when I need it and where I need it, and in some cases Linux does a better job, in most (for me, for my desktop) OS X does a better job, and in one case (EQ) Windows does it best.  It's called the right tool for the right job and I love that in two years I will have so much flexibility I won't know what do with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're going to have to start coming out with some much larger-sized laptop hard drives.  &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is what people should be worrying about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the one seriously huge plus about OS X running on x86?  VMware.  None of this VirtualPC slow-as-slugs stuff.  I am dying for the day to get an OS X-native VMware that I can fire up my two dozen virtual machines (Linux, *BSD, Windows) and work with it on a mac.  It gives me shivers just thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a spanky powerful build system now (dual Opteron), I had an extra athlon64 system no longer doing much of anything and while I contemplated turning it into a test system, turning it into a live web server would make it more of a test system than anything else I could do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this site is now running on Annvix 1.0-RELEASE/x86_64 rather than the x86 variant and the changeover was quite smooth. There was very little required to do, and I think I found maybe two bugs to fix before it could be done, which means that the x86_64 port turned out quite well. I'm pleased with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that this changeover is complete, I hope to have more time working on the baseline changes of Annvix (namely redoing and changing some of the SSP bits between glibc and gcc). Once that's done, time for a big recompile. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

Took me a bit, but worth it because I always do an erase and install... best time to clean up is when installing a new OS. Unfortunately, come Saturday morning, things didn't look so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing is the DVD verification failed at about 65% on my emac. Tried it three times and no dice; even skipped the verification (on the advice of the geniuses from where I bought it) and it failed during the install. Weird thing is it failed in the same place on my G5, but verified fine on my powerbook. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, brought it back, got a new one, and I was good to go. This one went ok, installed on the emac first... looked good. Installed on the G5 next.. what a mess. Let me tell you... having about 1.5TB of storage and Spotlight indexing right from the get-go is not a good thing. Took about 24hrs to do the indexing and even that was cleaning up a bunch of redundant files (I keep rsync backups of all my servers on a big 500GB drive so it's a lot of little files). Then I also told Spotlight to treat that drive as private. Not really private, but doesn't need to be indexed. Once I did that, things started moving smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other rough spots with some apps, noteably with PocketMac Pro which, when I disconnected my iPaq, caused a kernel panic. Apparently they will have a Tiger-certified version out within the first half of this month. Everything else seems to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I've been using Tiger for a few days, how do I find it? Well, I like it. I can't say yet that I like it much better than Panther, but it does feel faster (maybe due to the erase/install, I'm not sure). It seems quite a bit faster on my G5, and feels faster on the powerbook as well. Dashboard hasn't really done anything for me yet. I think the calculator is next to useless (which is the "big" thing for me as far as the stock widgets go)... when you try to divide something, it gives an error. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotlight is pretty cool, and I thought maybe it would replace Launchbar (which I love) as an app launcher. No way. For one, Spotlight returns too many results, and it's slower than Launchbar. So I'm glad I bought Launchbar a while back, even though everyone said Spotlight would do the same thing. It does, but not as efficiently. For me, Spotlight is killer to find stuff nested inside documents and files. That's the thing I like about it. Great search tool (although from the Finder it's a little wonky sometimes... if I do a search for something, sometimes I'll get no results until I capitalize something, even though there are no caps in the filename... go figure). Not sure if the search bit in the Finder is using Spotlight tho. Might not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I'm keen on trying is Automator... but I haven't played with it yet. Sounds like it could be a fantastic time-saver, unfortunately I don't have the time to figure it out. Oh well... maybe in the next few weeks when I finish a few projects. Then I'll be able to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I like Tiger. I do have to admit that Apple would do well to have more than one theme for the OS. Thank God for Unsanity's ShapeShifter... I need some variation and style and I honestly prefer the look of Panther to the look of Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know.. I know of at least one person personally who's had to roll back a machine to Panther. Sucks to be him I guess. I've read some reports from people who have Tiger but don't really think much of some of the new features. I like them all, except Dashboard, but I think it may become more useful once there are more third-party widgets (and once the calculator gets fixed). For the other stuff in Dashboard, that's what I have WeatherDock and wClock for. I don't really have a need for Dashboard.. maybe the stock ticker once I do some more investing on my own, but that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I like Tiger. Reading the features on Tiger Server really had me tickled... and irked that I don't have it (or an Xserve to run it on). Some very cool features in there. Would I use OS X server over Annvix? I doubt it. For one, the eye candy that is Aqua has to take a hit on performance that Annvix never will, and let's face it... although the cost of an Xserve is reasonable to other machines in that class it can't beat something like Annvix that I can happily run on an 800MHz duron... who can't get one of those for the fraction of the cost of an Xserve? Sure it may not be as cool looking or as fast, but it can definitely get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entry for another day, perhaps. I'll never really know until I get to play with one, but that likely won't ever happen... I can't justify ponying up for that kind of hardware just to tinker... all my important stuff runs on Annvix and I can tweak that far easier and faster than I can OS X. But, as far as Tiger goes... so far I'm enjoying it. Now I just have to wait for my copy of Remote Desktop to show up so I can enjoy the spring/summer weather working outside...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>Windows like OS X</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/windows-like-os-x.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-04-19T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-04-19T13:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-04-19:/blog/windows-like-os-x.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not really, OS X-related, but kinda is considering my Windows install looks more like a default OS X install than my Mac desktops do!

Read on for some good links to customizing Windows XP if you, like me, are saddled with using it some of the time and just can't stand how ugly the thing is out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange stuff, but I never thought I'd blog about Windows considering I can't stand it. However, it's become a necessary evil. For one, Quickbooks for Mac blows (especially the Canadian version), so I caved in and started using Quickbooks for Windows. Then I found Quicken for Mac was royally messing up my data, and reading about the latest version for Quicken for Mac (which, stupidly enough, isn't even available in Canada!) was no better, so I ditched Quicken for Mac to use Quicken for Windows after I couldn't find any good alternatives (online banking is a must).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, so I've got two important apps that I need Windows for (yes, I suppose I could use VMWare or Crossover Office or whatever, but I need things to be stable and I have a problem with upgrading Linux distros every 6mos (for work, I have to keep current) and reconfiguring stuff is a serious PITA. This is one reason I prefer OS X for my desktop machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, since I think Windows is hideously ugly, I like to mod it a bit. I had previously just used Stardock's excellent &lt;a href="http://www.windowblinds.net/"&gt;WindowBlinds&lt;/a&gt; program (shareware, but worth it in my opinion since it makes Windows look less Windows-ish). After using it for a while, I stumbled across this mod that makes Windows look very close to a default OS X setup... it's called &lt;a href="http://osx.portraitofakite.com/"&gt;FlyakiteOSX&lt;/a&gt; and if you haven't seen this you at least need to see this guy's website. It's amazing! Anyways, this mod makes my Windows machine look more like a Mac than my Mac does (I use Unsanity's excellent &lt;a href="http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/shapeshifter"&gt;ShapeShifter&lt;/a&gt; preference pane to "skin" OS X and I don't care what anyone says... Unsanity's stuff is very reliable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after monkeying around with that, which also installs Stardock's ObjectDock (which essentially looks like the OS X dock even with magnified icons on it.. very cool), I went looking for LiteStep which I used to use back in the Win98 days. It's a bit different now (I'm almost positive that it used to do virtual desktops), but seems fairly decent... I'll have to tweak it a bit to make it behave the way that I want it to. Since it didn't do virtual desktops, I ended up switching back to Explorer for the shell (LiteStep is a shell replacement that's not quite as bloated) and found Microsoft has a virtual desktop PowerToy available called &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx"&gt;Virtual Desktop Manager&lt;/a&gt; and it seems to work ok.. not nearly as smooth as anything on OS X or Linux, but it beats having a single desktop (can people actually work efficiently with only one desktop these days?!?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I just found all of this quite cool. I don't particularly care for Windows... about the only thing it's good for is EverQuest, Quicken, and QuickBooks (that's pretty much all I use it for). But the fact that I can make it look a lot less Windows-ish (read: butt-ugly), makes it a little better. Now if we could just do something about the stability of the whole thing... &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>LDAP Editor for OS X: Found!</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/ldap-editor-for-os-x-found.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-04-06T12:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2005-04-06T12:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-04-06:/blog/ldap-editor-for-os-x-found.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use LDAP for authentication on my LAN (I wrote one of the earliest and definitive articles available on the internet for MandrakeSecure quite a while back), but I find dealing with LDAP to be a serious PITA.

It's not the easiest thing to manage from the commandline... a GUI or web-based interface is almost required or you'll end up ripping off facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went hunting for an OS X-based client in order to manage the LDAP directory because my main desktop is an OS X machine. On the Linux side things are easy enough to find... A program called DirectoryAdministrator works remarkably well. Doing a search for "ldap" on versiontracker came up with about four entries... four! That's disgusting! The only one that seemed close to what I needed would only let you edit mail entries... I have a lot more in my LDAP database than an address book, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting on Google had me finding a program called &lt;a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~gawor/ldap/"&gt;LDAP Browser/Editor&lt;/a&gt; (written in Java tho). I'm not keen on Java to begin with, but Java apps seem to run at a decent speed on my machine... I use the Zend editor quite a bit and it's written in Java... no Aqua niceness, but whatever. Anyways, this program rocks. It allows me to edit, add, make templates from, etc. for my LDAP database. This is exactly the tool I needed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just felt like sharing in case anyone else is looking for the same kind of tool. I did notice in my Googling that OS X server seems to come with a nice looking tool called Workgroup Manager... why can't they put something like that in mainline OS X? Heck, I'd even pay a few bucks to have it as a separate app. I mean, really, how often will you log into the server in order to admin the database? The beauty of LDAP is that I can have the server tucked away and connect to it from my desktop machine and make changes to the directory without ever actually logging into the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, the article I saw mentioning Workgroup Manager is from the O'Reilly MacDevCenter entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/05/25/ldap.html"&gt;LDAP in Mac OS X Server &lt;/a&gt;". I don't really want to pony up for OS X Server to run that tool on my desktop, but dangit, those screen shots look pretty sharp.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Macos"></category></entry><entry><title>linsec.ca changeover complete</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/linsecca-changeover-complete.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-03-26T22:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-03-26T22:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-03-26:/blog/linsecca-changeover-complete.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spammers irritate the heck out of me.

And due to the open nature of TWiki, they've begun to take advantage of it and start including little hidden spam links on the site. I'm sorry to generalize, but every one of these spammers have been Chinese. It's very very annoying. They've been doing this with the &lt;a href="http://mandrake.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;Mandrake Community Wiki&lt;/a&gt; which I also host, but that site is really large and has quite a number of contributors. The good (or bad, depending on how you look at it) thing about not having really any contributors to linsec.ca is that I can arbitrarily change the format of my site without worrying about it affecting anyone other than those who have pages bookmarked... for that I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the transition is done and all of the pages are finally over into the new "semi-static" format. The content is the same although I did try to clean up a few things... but I may have also left a mess from the TWiki conversion. Hopefully if anyone notices any of these artifacts, they'll let me know so I can clean them up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added the djbdns and qmail articles that I wrote and that were on the (now defunct) MandrakeSecure website in the past. They're dated, but then again, the software itself hasn't had updates in ages so I guess the info is still relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one doc that I want to carry forward from the old site called "Introduction to msec" but I need to sit down and re-work it so that it's still valid as I originally wrote the old article for Mandrakelinux 8.2. I'll need to update it for 10.2 (sorry, Limited Edition 2005) one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next big "project" is to setup a Kerberos5 system on my local LAN and although I wrote a two-part series for TechRepublic over 4 years ago, I think I can do better than to just re-type the old docs (which were a little brief due to size constraints). I think that should make for an interesting article, and then an article to tie both Kerberos5 and LDAP together should be interesting as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, documenting OS X as a client for a LDAP-based authentication system (which I haven't gotten to work yet), and including Kerberos (which, by the sounds of things, may be the easier part), will really make for an interesting set of articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I'm open to suggestions for new articles. I'm also really open to donations if you do have a suggestion... =) Considering the huge (relatively speaking) number of hits some of these articles have had, I'm actually amazed that someone hasn't thrown a few bucks my way but oh well... I've become used to it (if anyone knows about the &lt;a href="http://anthill.vmlinuz.ca/"&gt;Anthill&lt;/a&gt; project they'll know what I mean). At any rate, if you do have something you'd like to see me cover, I'd really like to see you pony up for it (after all, I'd be writing about something interesting to you, not necessarily interesting to me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I do book reviews! Send me a book, I'll read it and review it. All I want out of the deal is to keep the book (which is a great deal for me for good books, not such a good deal for crappy ones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, hopefully I'll be able to squeeze a little extra time into documenting different things, although I think from this point forward they will be taking a decidedly Annvix slant unless it's on some software that Annvix doesn't ship (at which point it will be based on Mandrakelinux). Of course, if it's something applicable to both, then I'll note both (primarily because Annvix is service-based and Mandrakelinux is initscripts-based).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Using runit instead of SysVinit</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/using-runit-instead-of-sysvinit.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-03-21T12:21:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-03-21T12:21:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-03-21:/blog/using-runit-instead-of-sysvinit.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been a huge fan of service-style handling of daemons since I first played with qmail a number of years ago.

Using daemontools and supervise was awesome, even if it was only for qmail and djbdns back then. When I first decided to start my own proof-of-concept secure Linux distro (&lt;a href="http://annvix.org/"&gt;Annvix&lt;/a&gt;), one of the first things I decided on was to use daemontools to manage supervised services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, daemontools is a little bit encumbered due to DJB's licensing restrictions, and that's when I came upon runit which, in my mind, is the cat's meow. Not only does it do what daemontools does, but it also completely replaces SysVinit which means I didn't have to deal with both systems. This also spurred me to completely port the initscripts for services I was shipping to run scripts for use with runit. No excuse for laziness by keeping both systems. =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this morning I found a nice writeup about using runit called "&lt;a href="http://www.pycs.net/lateral/stories/36.html"&gt;Booting with runit&lt;/a&gt;". This is a pretty good description of what runit is, does, and why it should be preferred over SysVinit. Unfortunately, the author didn't know that Annvix was the first Linux distro to be 100% runit out of the box... so I had to let him know about that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>linsec.ca Changes</title><link href="https://vdanen.github.io/blog/linsecca-changes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-03-21T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2005-03-21T12:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Vincent Danen</name></author><id>tag:vdanen.github.io,2005-03-21:/blog/linsecca-changes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The linsec.ca site has had a few changes and this is due primarily to the fact that chinese spammers are abusing the wiki.
