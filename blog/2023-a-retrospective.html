<p>It&#8217;s the end of 2023 and, as is my custom, I always read my <a href="https://annvix.com/blog/2022-a-retrospective">retrospective</a> from
the prior year.  And&#8230; umm&#8230; 2023 was <em>not</em> better than 2022.  Well, in some
ways perhaps but in many ways it was not what I was hoping it would be.  But,
I&#8217;m resolved to look on the bright side of&nbsp;things!</p>
<p>On the positive side, travel experiences this year were vastly better than
last year.  And I was able to go to a few places this year for work.  I was
in Boston in March, Virginia in April (first time there), Vancouver (for
<span class="caps">OSS</span> Summit) and Boston (for Red Hat Summit) in May, Jasper Alberta in
September (for holidays, we love Jasper!) as well as Raleigh, the
Netherlands in October (for Summit Connect <span class="caps">NL</span>) and then also Raleigh and
Boston (October was brutal!) and finally Chicago in November (for OpenShift
Commons/Kubecon, first time there as well).  All in all, it was busy,
particularly Sept-Nov as it felt like between trips I was only home for a
few days before having to head back to the&nbsp;airport.</p>
<p>The upside (and apologies to my wife) was that I missed a lot of the home
renovations we did.  We gutted the upstairs of our home and redid
everything except the kitchen (which we&#8217;d redone a few years ago).  Really
pleased with how it turned out, less pleased that it took five months to
complete.  That said, I&#8217;m glad we did it and so the wait was ultimately
worth&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>We also had to take care of my mother-in-law for two months.  My father-in-law
was in the hospital for &#8220;day surgery&#8221; on his ankle and we anticipated it
lasting a week (after all, who believes doctors?).  He was in hospital and
rehab for <em>four months</em>!  Unfortunately, due to the renovation schedule and the
loss of use of the upstairs, my mother-in-law had to go to her sister after
those two months so we could get things moving.  It actually turned out well as
her sister didn&#8217;t have stairs in her home and we realized (too late) that the
stairs were wrecking her hip and giving her a lot of pain (including one trip
to the&nbsp;hospital).</p>
<p>Unlike our trip to Jasper last year, this year was <em>perfect</em> and was an
awesome time to wind down and relax.  I think it was our best trip to
Jasper ever and was so relaxing.  Which was good because we came home at
the end of the week and on Sunday I was flying to Raleigh and starting a
<em>lot</em> of travel.  That said, the trip to the Netherlands was awesome as
I&#8217;ve not been there in over 30 years and was able to reconnect with cousins
and aunts and uncles on both sides of the family that I&#8217;d not seen for
decades.  One of my cousins took us to the <a href="https://www.goudacheese-experience.com/">Gouda Cheese
Experience</a> and I highly recommend
it.  A museum for cheese is an odd idea but it was&nbsp;fascinating!</p>
<p>I also did quite well this year in the exercise department, trying to get a bit
more active.  I find exercising so incredibly boring, however, that I do it
while playing video games.  Well, two in particular.  Nioh and Nioh 2.  I&#8217;ve
put a ridiculous amount of time into these games and have probably played them
more than any other games (300 hours and attained level 340 in Nioh, 570 hours
and attained level 750 in Nioh 2).  I also had a daily activity streak that hit
238 days (thanks for tracking Apple Watch!) but sadly that streak got ruined
when I got <span class="caps">COVID</span> for the third, maybe fourth, time in November.  I still have a
lingering cough as I write this.  It was actually pretty bad this&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Speaking of health, my wife&#8217;s health is really great (aside from me giving her
<span class="caps">COVID</span>).  The blood, iron and ferritin counts are all up and good so she&#8217;s
energetic and able to do whatever she wants.  Of course it does require a lot
of supplements but whatever, she&#8217;s feeling really great which was a huge plus
this&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>My daughter also moved out this year (hence the renovations).  Is this a good
thing or bad thing?  I suppose it depends on whether she&#8217;s reading this or not
;)  I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s neither good nor bad.  I definitely miss having her around
all the time, but it&#8217;s so awesome to see what she&#8217;s doing on her own and
overcoming her own fears of even being able to do it on her own.  She&#8217;s doing
amazing!  I couldn&#8217;t be prouder of her.  I do miss her cat though.  I need to
visit them both more&nbsp;often!</p>
<p>With her cat leaving, that left Ted alone.  I think he appreciated the
peace and quiet though, but that didn&#8217;t last long.  My wife got a ragdoll
kitten that we named Stuart.  He&#8217;s very similar in attitude to my
daughter&#8217;s cat (poor Ted, he will always be someone&#8217;s chicken nugget to
chew on!) but he&#8217;s a pretty awesome cat and so soft.  Great addition to the
family this&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>From a work perspective, this was an interesting year.  It was tough, due to
all of the personal things going on (renovations are highly disruptive and
having her mother-in-law here for two months was as well) so by the time we
went to Jasper I really needed the break.  The beginning of the year was marred
by drama at work that made me less enthusiastic and probably quite a bit
grumpier than usual.  Thankfully that was resolved and right now I&#8217;m really
pumped for next year.  That said, it feels riskier to be in the
technology/security space right now as evidenced by the <span class="caps">SEC</span> going after the
SolarWinds <span class="caps">CISO</span> personally.  A lot of those responsible for security programs
are feeling that pressure and uncertainty &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t feel as &#8220;fun&#8221; as it
used to with stuff like that hanging over our heads.  Yet, while not always &#8220;fun&#8221;
necessarily, there are plenty of things that make the job&nbsp;rewarding.</p>
<p>Finally, I started our <span class="caps">ALDE</span> (Advanced Leadership Development Experience)
program this year which I&#8217;d put off for a few years since doing <span class="caps">ALDP</span> back
in 2018.  Thus far it&#8217;s been great.  Getting more input from my boss, from
my coach, from my staff, from indirect staff has been challenging and
rewarding.  Lots of areas to work on to become a better version of myself,
so I&#8217;ve spent quite a bit of time reflecting on how I can change.  2024
will be a very different year for me in terms of how I lead, based on that
reflection and inputs, and some actions I&#8217;ve put into place already.  I&#8217;m
looking forward to it.  I think it will be good for me and the&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>Speaking of the team, I can&#8217;t help but think how awesome they are.  Not just my
staff &#8212; they&#8217;re pretty good &#8212; but the entire organization.  Truly blessed to
be working with some of the brightest minds in the industry!  These guys and
gals really give me the juice to get up each day and work, even when things are
crappy.  Huge shoutout to Red Hat Product Security.  You all are amazing&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Christmas this year was pretty awesome as well.  All healthy, all good.
Great times with family and friends.  The weather was definitely odd&#8230;
this time last year we had a cold streak in the -30C range, this year we&#8217;re
at or above 0C most days.  This week we even got up to 5C&#8230; pretty much
shorts and t-shirt weather for us Albertans!  Also got very into puzzles
over Christmas.  My wife got us advent calendar puzzles which was fun and
it started a bit of an obsession now, so we ordered a few other puzzles to
put together. It was great to end the year so nice.  Merry belated
Christmas and happy new year to&nbsp;everyone!</p>
<p>No new tattoos this year.  The downside of running out of room I suppose.
Seriously considering neck-tatts but my wife isn&#8217;t a fan of my chosen design
(the Alien dual mouth on my throat.. she&#8217;s threatening no more kisses).  Oh
well, maybe not&nbsp;;)</p>
<h2 id="books-read">Books read<a class="headerlink" href="#books-read" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>I do a fair bit of reading, but if I&#8217;m honest I stopped reading almost
anything non-fiction since the <span class="caps">COVID</span>-19 pandemic started.  This year I
wanted to get back into reading more than just fiction (while still
continuing to read fiction as that&#8217;s part of my go-to-sleep ritual).  So to
hold myself accountable to that goal I&#8217;ve been tracking which books I&#8217;ve
read this&nbsp;year.</p>
